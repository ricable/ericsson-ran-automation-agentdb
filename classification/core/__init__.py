Core Classification Components

This module contains the essential classification components that provide
lightweight, self-contained functionality for basic RAN feature classification.

Components:
    base_classifier: Unified feature classifier with configurable granularity
    technology_detector: Enhanced technology domain detection
    skill_assessor: Unified skill level assessment

These components are designed to be lightweight and have minimal external
dependencies, making them suitable for basic classification tasks.
