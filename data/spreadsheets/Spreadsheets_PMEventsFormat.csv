- Digits 0 to 9, encoded 0000 to 1001.

In each octet, two digits are encoded:
- Bits 4 to 1 of octet n encode digit 2n-1.
- Bits 8 to 5 of octet n encode digit 2n.
- 1111 is used as filler digit.

PLMN identity consists of three digits from MCC succeeded by one of following variations:
- In case of a two-digit MNC, one filler digit plus two digits from MNC.
- In case of a three-digit MNC, three digits from MNC.

- Bits 4 to 1 of octet n encode digit 2n-1.
- Bits 8 to 5 of octet n encode digit 2n.
- 1111 is used as filler digit, if needed.

PLMN identity consists of three digits from Mobile Country Code (MCC), followed by one of following combinations:
- In case of a two-digit MNC, one filler digit, plus two digits from MNC.
- In case of a three-digit MNC, three digits from MNC.
