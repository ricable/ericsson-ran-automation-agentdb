- **Cognitive Consciousness Framework**: Strange-loop optimization patterns
- **Action Execution System**: Closed-loop feedback with self-healing capabilities
- **Error Handling & Resilience**: Comprehensive fault tolerance and recovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Sub-second anomaly detection and optimization

### ðŸ§  Cognitive Architecture Implementation

#### Core Components
```typescript
interface CognitiveRANCore {
  temporalReasoning: TemporalConsciousnessCore;     // Rust/WASM cores
  cognitivePatterns: StrangeLoopOptimizer;          // Self-referential cognition
  actionExecution: ClosedLoopEngine;                 // Autonomous optimization
  monitoringSystem: PerformanceMonitor;              // Real-time analytics
}
```

#### Key Achievements
