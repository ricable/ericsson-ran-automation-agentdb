**AgentDB gives agents a real cognitive layer that boots in milliseconds, lives locally (disk or memory), and synchronizes globally when needed.** Zero ops. No latency overhead. Just instant recall, persistent learning, and real-time coordination—all inside the runtime of your agent.

When you're building agentic systems, every millisecond, every inference, and every decision matters. Traditional memory stores add remote calls, require orchestration, or force heavy infrastructure. **AgentDB flips that by putting the memory inside the agent workflow—light, fast, and always ready.**

## 🧠 Frontier Memory Features (v1.1.0+)

Advanced memory patterns that go beyond simple vector storage to enable true cognitive capabilities:

### 1. 🔄 Reflexion Memory (Episodic Replay)
**Learn from experience with self-critique**

Store complete task episodes with self-generated critiques, then replay them to improve future performance.

```bash
# Store episode with self-critique
agentdb reflexion store "session-1" "fix_auth_bug" 0.95 true \
  "OAuth2 flow worked perfectly" "login failing" "fixed tokens" 1200 500

# Retrieve similar episodes
agentdb reflexion retrieve "authentication issues" 10 0.8

# Get critique summary
agentdb reflexion critique "fix_auth_bug" 10 0.5

# Prune old episodes
agentdb reflexion prune 90 0.5
```

**Benefits:** Learn from successes and failures · Build expertise over time · Avoid repeating mistakes

### 2. 🎓 Skill Library (Lifelong Learning)
**Consolidate successful patterns into reusable skills**

Transform repeated successful task executions into parameterized skills that can be composed and reused.

```bash
# Create a reusable skill
agentdb skill create "jwt_auth" "Generate JWT tokens" \
  '{"inputs": {"user": "object"}}' "implementation code..." 1

# Search for applicable skills
agentdb skill search "authentication" 5 0.5

# Auto-consolidate from successful episodes
agentdb skill consolidate 3 0.7 7

# Update skill statistics
agentdb skill update 1 1 0.95 true 1200

# Prune underperforming skills
agentdb skill prune 3 0.4 60
```

**Features:** Automatic skill extraction · Semantic search · Usage tracking · Success rate monitoring

### 3. 🔗 Causal Memory Graph
**Intervention-based causality with `p(y|do(x))` semantics**

Learn cause-and-effect relationships between agent actions, not just correlations. Discover what interventions lead to which outcomes using doubly robust estimation.

```bash
# Automated causal discovery (dry-run first)
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7 true

# Run for real (creates causal edges + skills)
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7 false

# Prune low-quality causal edges
agentdb learner prune 0.5 0.05 90
```

**Use Cases:** Understand which debugging strategies fix bugs · Learn what code patterns improve performance · Discover what approaches lead to success

### 4. 📜 Explainable Recall with Certificates
**Provenance tracking with cryptographic Merkle proofs**

Every retrieved memory comes with a "certificate" explaining why it was selected, with cryptographic proof of completeness.

```bash
# Retrieve with explanation certificate
agentdb recall with-certificate "successful API optimization" 5 0.7 0.2 0.1
```

**Benefits:** Understand why memories were selected · Verify retrieval completeness · Debug agent decisions · Build trust through transparency

### 5. 🎯 Causal Recall (Utility-Based Reranking)
**Smart retrieval combining similarity, causality, and latency**

Standard vector search returns similar memories. Causal Recall reranks by actual utility: `U = α·similarity + β·uplift − γ·latency`

```bash
# Retrieve what actually works (built into recall with-certificate)
agentdb recall with-certificate "optimize response time" 5 0.7 0.2 0.1
#                                                          ^ α   β   γ
```

**Why It Matters:** Retrieves what works, not just what's similar · Balances relevance with effectiveness · Accounts for performance costs

### 6. 🌙 Nightly Learner (Automated Discovery)
**Background process that discovers patterns while you sleep**

Runs automated causal discovery on episode history, finding patterns you didn't explicitly program.

```bash
# Discover patterns (dry-run shows what would be created)
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7 true

# Actual discovery (creates skills + causal edges)
agentdb learner run 3 0.6 0.7 false
```

**Features:** Asynchronous execution · Discovers causal edges · Auto-consolidates skills · Prunes low-quality patterns

### Quick Validation

# See your frontier memory in action

# Get help on any command

## 🎯 Why AgentDB?

### Built for the Agentic Era

Most memory systems were designed for data retrieval. AgentDB was built for **autonomous cognition** — agents that need to remember, learn, and act together in real time.

In agentic systems, memory isn't a feature. It's the foundation of continuity. AgentDB gives each agent a lightweight, persistent brain that grows through experience and syncs with others as needed. Whether running solo or as part of a swarm, every agent stays informed, adaptive, and self-improving.

**What makes it different:**
AgentDB lives where the agent lives — inside the runtime, not as an external service. It turns short-term execution into long-term intelligence without touching a network call.

### 🧠 For Engineers Who Build Agents That Think

* Run reasoning where it happens — inside the control loop
* Persist experiences without remote dependencies
* **Learn cause-and-effect, not just correlations**
* **Explain every retrieval with cryptographic proofs**
* **Self-improve through reflexion and critique**
* Sync distributed cognition in real time
* Deploy anywhere: Node, browser, edge, MCP
* Scale from one agent to thousands without re-architecture

AgentDB isn't just a faster vector store.
It's the missing layer that lets agents **remember what worked, learn what didn't, share what matters, and explain why.**
