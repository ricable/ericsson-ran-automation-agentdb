💡 Stored 3 new patterns
```

### 3. Training System Integration

```bash
# Enable training for CLI
export AGENTIC_FLOW_TRAINING=true
export REASONINGBANK_ENABLED=true

# Run task - system learns automatically
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "Implement rate limiting"

# System now uses reasoning agents behind the scenes:
# 1. Retrieves relevant memories
# 2. Synthesizes context
# 3. Matches patterns
# 4. Executes with learning
# 5. Curates learnings
# 6. Consolidates if needed
```

```

### Automatic vs Manual Mode

**Automatic (Default)**:
- `reasoning-optimized` selects best strategy
- Adapts based on task characteristics
- No user configuration needed

**Manual Override**:
```bash
# Force specific strategy
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "..." --reasoning-strategy quality-first

# Disable reasoning (base agent only)
npx agentic-flow --agent coder --task "..." --no-reasoning
```
