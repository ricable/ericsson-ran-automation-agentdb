# QUIC Build Instructions

## Current Status: Research & Planning Phase ‚ö†Ô∏è

The QUIC implementation is currently in the **research and planning phase**. While comprehensive research has been completed and the architecture has been designed, the actual Rust/WASM implementation is **not yet built**.

## What's Complete ‚úÖ

1. **Research Document** (`docs/plans/quic-research.md`)
   - Comprehensive QUIC protocol analysis
   - Performance projections (2.8-4.4x improvement)
   - Library comparison (quinn recommended)
   - 6-month implementation roadmap

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Rust crate structure defined
   - WASM bindings planned
   - TypeScript integration designed
   - Proxy integration architecture

3. **Documentation** (Mock/Design Phase)
   - Configuration guide
   - API reference
   - Migration guide
   - Test specifications
   - Benchmark plans

4. **Release Planning**
   - v2.1.0 changelog prepared
   - Release notes drafted
   - Post-release tasks documented

## What's NOT Complete ‚ùå

1. **Rust QUIC Crate** - Placeholder code only
2. **WASM Build** - Not compiled (bindgen issues)
3. **TypeScript Integration** - Mock implementations
4. **Tests** - Specification only (not executable)
5. **Benchmarks** - Design only (not runnable)

## Build Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: npm dependencies
```
Error: @fails-components/webtransport build failed
Node.js v22.17.0 import assertion syntax not supported
```

**Resolution**: Update package.json to remove problematic dependencies

### Issue 2: Rust WASM build
```
Error: aws-lc-sys build failed
bindgen feature required for WASM target
```

**Resolution**: Either:
- Enable bindgen feature in Cargo.toml
- Use alternative TLS backend (rustls-ring instead of aws-lc-rs)
- Build for native target first, then WASM

## Next Steps to Build QUIC

### Phase 1: Fix Dependencies (1-2 days)

```bash
# 1. Fix Rust dependencies
cd /workspaces/agentic-flow/crates/agentic-flow-quic
cargo update
cargo build --release  # Native build first

# 2. Install bindgen-cli
cargo install --force --locked bindgen-cli

# 3. Build for WASM (after native build succeeds)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 4. Package with wasm-pack
cargo install wasm-pack
wasm-pack build --target nodejs --out-dir ../../dist/wasm
```

### Phase 2: Implement Core Features (2-4 weeks)

1. **Basic Client/Server** (Week 1)
   - Implement QuicClient with connection establishment
   - Implement QuicServer with stream handling
   - Test with simple echo protocol

2. **Stream Multiplexing** (Week 2)
   - Add concurrent stream support
   - Implement stream prioritization
   - Test with multiple concurrent agents

3. **TypeScript Integration** (Week 3)
   - Load WASM module in Node.js
   - Create TypeScript wrapper
   - Integrate with proxy

4. **Testing & Validation** (Week 4)
   - Write executable tests
   - Run benchmarks
   - Validate performance claims

### Phase 3: Optimization (1-2 weeks)

1. **Performance Tuning**
   - Profile with flamegraph
   - Optimize buffer sizes
   - Tune BBR congestion control

2. **Production Hardening**
   - Error handling
   - Connection migration
   - Retry logic

### Phase 4: Release (1 week)

1. **Final Validation**
   - Full test suite passing
   - Benchmarks validated
   - Documentation complete

2. **Deployment**
   - Merge PR
   - Publish to npm
   - Monitor adoption

## Alternative: Use Existing QUIC Libraries

Instead of Rust/WASM, consider:

### Option 1: Node.js Native QUIC
```bash
npm install @fails-components/webtransport  # Experimental
npm install quiche-native  # Native bindings to quiche
```

**Pros**: No WASM complexity, simpler integration
**Cons**: Platform-dependent, requires native compilation

### Option 2: HTTP/3 Libraries
```bash
npm install http3  # HTTP/3 over QUIC
npm install @cloudflare/quic  # Cloudflare's implementation
```

**Pros**: Production-ready, well-maintained
**Cons**: May not expose low-level QUIC features

### Option 3: Defer QUIC to v3.0.0

Focus on HTTP/2 optimizations for v2.1.0:
- Connection pooling improvements
- Stream multiplexing optimization
- Header compression tuning

Save QUIC for v3.0.0 when ecosystem is more mature.

## Recommended Approach

**For v2.1.0 (Current Release):**
1. Ship with HTTP/2 optimizations only
2. Mark QUIC as "experimental" or "future feature"
3. Keep research and design docs
4. Update changelog to reflect actual status

**For v2.2.0 (Next Minor):**
1. Implement basic QUIC support
2. Native Node.js bindings (not WASM initially)
3. Feature flag for opt-in testing

**For v3.0.0 (Major Release):**
1. Production-ready QUIC with WASM
2. Full feature parity with HTTP/2
3. Default to QUIC with fallback

## Current Build Commands (For Native Target)

```bash
# Build Rust crate (native)
cd crates/agentic-flow-quic
cargo build --release

# Run Rust tests
cargo test

# Build TypeScript (without WASM)
cd /workspaces/agentic-flow
npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # Skip problematic dependencies
npm run build

# Note: Integration tests will fail without WASM module
```

## Summary

**Status**: üìã **Research Complete, Implementation Not Started**

The QUIC implementation is fully designed but not yet built. The research validates the 2.8-4.4x performance improvement potential, but actual implementation will require 6-8 weeks of focused development.

**Recommendation**:
- Ship v2.1.0 **without** QUIC
- Focus on HTTP/2 optimizations
- Plan QUIC for v2.2.0 or v3.0.0
- Use current work as design specification

**Alternative for Immediate Use**:
- Use existing Node.js QUIC libraries
- Wrap in same API surface
- Benchmark against HTTP/2
- Validate performance claims
