# 1 NR Emergency Procedures Overview

The NR Emergency Procedures feature supports the setup of emergency voice calls in an NR

SA deployment.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The NR Emergency Procedures feature allows the UE to set up an emergency call over NR.

EPS fallback is performed with blind RwR in the following cases:

- If the feature license is not active.
- If EPS fallback is forced during the operation of the feature.

The feature does not support admission control with emergency call prioritization.

By using this feature, regulatory requirements can be met for emergency services.

Additionally, the operator can configure the way an emergency call is established

over NR or LTE.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Admission control with emergency call prioritization is not supported.

Network Requirements

The feature requires a VoNR-capable UE to operate.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Emergency Procedures

The NR Emergency Procedures feature allows to set up an emergency voice call in an NR SA

deployment when it is requested by the UE.

With the NR Emergency Procedures feature, the UE can perform an emergency call that the

5GC receives. Therefore, no emergency fallback to LTE is performed.

Emergency calls can be detected in the following cases:

- The UE sends RRC SETUP REQUEST with establishment cause emergency.
- ARP values of the 5QI = 5 or 5QI = 1 flows requested for the voice call PDU session match the ARP values that are configured to be used for emergency.

For more information, see NR Emergency Fallback to LTE.

Related tasks

Activate NR Emergency Procedures

## 3.1 Establishment of Emergency Calls

An emergency call can be set up regardless of the license of the NR Emergency

Procedures feature being activated or not.

The License of NR Emergency Procedures Feature is Activated

If the license of the feature is activated, an emergency call PDU session is set up

in the following cases:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm parameter is set to ACTIVE.
- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute is set to FORCED and there is no available LTE frequency band for the EPS fallback.
- The Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible parameter is set to false, and the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is not received.
- The value of the received Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is set to not possible.

Otherwise EPS fallback with blind RwR is performed.

The License of NR Emergency Procedures Feature is Not Activated

If the license of the feature is not activated, an emergency call PDU session is set

up in the following cases:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute is set to FORCED and there is no available LTE frequency band for the EPS fallback.
- The Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible parameter is set to false and the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is not received.
- The value of the received Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is set to not possible.

Otherwise EPS fallback with blind RwR is performed.

## 3.2 Handover with Emergency Call

When a target gNodeB receives the NGAP: HANDOVER REQUEST message

including a PDU session with 5QI = 1, it checks for emergency call. If the PDU session has

5QI = 1 flow or 5QI = 5 flow with ARP level configured for emergency call, emergency call is

detected.

Handover of Emergency Call is Performed

The handover is performed and emergency call PDU session is set up in the following

cases:

- The license of the NR Emergency Procedures feature is activated, and the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm configuration parameter is set to ACTIVE.
- The license of the NR Emergency Procedures feature is activated, the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm configuration parameter is set to FORCED, and the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rejectVoiceIncHoAtEpsFb parameter is set to FALSE.

Handover of Emergency Call is Not Performed

The target gNodeB does not allow handover in the following cases:

- The license of the NR Emergency Procedures feature is not activated
- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm configuration parameter is set to FORCED, and the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rejectVoiceIncHoAtEpsFb parameter is set to TRUE.

If there are other sessions than the emergency call voice PDU session that can be set

up for the UE, and at least one is admitted, the NGAP: HANDOVER

REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message is sent with the voice PDU session for

emergency call listed as failed to be set up.

If the emergency call voice session is the only session, it is not admitted and the

NGAP: HANDOVER FAILURE message is sent with the voice PDU session

for emergency listed as failed to be set up.

## 3.3 Emergency Call at PDU Session Setup

An emergency call is detected if the followings apply:

- A voice call with 5QI=1 flow is received at PDU session setup with the NGAP PDU Session Resource Setup Request or the NGAP Initial Context Setup Request message.
- The Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level is configured for emergency call.

The emergency call can be detected for example, when the UE starts to lose Wi-Fi

coverage during a voice call and requests the 5GC to continue the conversation.

The License of the NR Emergency Procedures Feature Is Activated

If the license of the feature is activated, an emergency voice call flow is set up in

the following cases:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm parameter is set to ACTIVE.
- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute is set to FORCED and there is no available LTE frequency band for the EPS fallback.
- The Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible parameter is set to false, and the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is not received.
- The value of the received Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is set to not possible.
- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup attribute is set to INACTIVE.

Otherwise EPS fallback with blind RwR is performed.

The License of the NR Emergency Procedures Feature Is Not Activated

If the license of the feature is not activated, an emergency voice call flow is set

up in the following cases:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute is set to FORCED and there is no available LTE frequency band for the EPS fallback.
- The Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible parameter is set to false and the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is not received.
- The value of the received Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback information element is set to not possible.
- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup attribute is set to INACTIVE.

Otherwise EPS fallback with blind RwR is performed.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Emergency Procedures

The operation of the NR Emergency Procedures feature affects the NR Uu and NG

interfaces. It also has a number of requirements related to the UE, the 5GC, and

ENM.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following interfaces:

| NR Uu   |    | The value of the EstablishmentCause IE in the                                     RRCSetupRequest message is set to                                     emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# 6 Performance of NR Emergency Procedures

The feature introduces a number of counters and performance indicators, and uses

existing counters and events to measure performance.

Performance Indicators

The feature introduces the following performance indicators:

| DRB Accessibility – Success Rate for Emergency Calls              |    | Monitors DRB accessibility for emergency calls.  This performance indicator can be assessed using the following                                 formula:  100 × (pmRrcConnEstabSuccEm +                                     pmRrcResumeSuccFallbackEm) /                                     (pmRrcConnEstabAttEm -                                     pmRrcConnEstabAttReattEm +                                     pmRrcResumeAttFallbackEm) ×                                     (pmNgSigConnEstabSuccEm /                                     pmNgSigConnEstabAttEm) ×                                     (pmDrbEstabSuccArp /                                     pmDrbEstabAttArp)   |
