Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The following limitations are applicable:

- The feature primarily uses Fixed Wireless Access Device.
- High power UE and Line of Sight (LOS) are required for devices located at larger distances.
- The same value must be configured for the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute for all cells connected to the same SectorEquipmentFunction MO Class. For more information on cell relation for High-Band cells, see Manage Radio Network.
- Non-high-powered devices are not expected to work at longer distances.
- The maximum supported timing advance is UE-dependent. Because of this, UEs with a shorter supported timing advance than required cannot utilize the full cell range.

Network Requirements

A high-powered FWA UE is required to support cell ranges up to 14,000 m.

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band

This feature introduces PRACH preamble format C2 and extends the cell range of PRACH

preamble format A3.

This feature supports propagation delay for cell ranges up to 14,000 m with the 4

downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern.

PRACH preamble format A3 is supported for the following

cell ranges:

- 0-1,100 m
- 6,901-14,000 m

PRACH preamble format C2 is used for cell ranges between

1,101-6,900 m. If the Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature is

activated, PRACH preamble format C2 is supported for cell ranges between 0-1,100 m.

For more information about the configuration of PRACH preamble format C2, see

3GPP TS 38.213.

The last symbol of a PRACH slot is configured for the Periodic Scheduling Request on

PUCCH. It can be used for receiving

either

a

PRACH preamble

or

a

Scheduling Request.

The

wide

beam selection for receiving

preambles

in PRACH slots is determined by the SSB relation. The ratio of use for the last symbol

of a PRACH slot between the PRACH preamble and the Scheduling Request is configured

through

the NRCellDU.fixWideBeamsForPeriodicSr attribute. The probability of

successful PRACH preamble reception increases if this symbol is used multiple times for

preamble reception. However, this

might

increase

latency

because the number of

Scheduling Request opportunities

decreases.

The operator can choose the level of RACH success by selecting one of the following

levels,

where None denotes the highest preference level for latency:

- None
- Low
- Medium
- High

Operational Process

The feature requires that the following parameters are set:

- NRCellDU.fixWideBeamsForPeriodicSr
- NRCellDU.cellRange
- NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat

# 4 Network Impact of Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band

This feature extends the cell coverage by configuring additional gap symbols in

special slots between downlink and uplink. This results in downlink throughput reduction,

while degradation in uplink throughput is not expected.

Capacity and Performance

The extension of cell coverage results in additional gap symbols between downlink and

uplink. The number of gap symbols depends on the configured cell range. Increased

cell coverage results in downlink throughput reduction as shown in Table 2.

When the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute is set to

a

value higher

than

579 m in High-Band, additional downlink symbols are used for gaps to accommodate for

the propagation delay. Downlink symbols that are unusable for downlink transmission

and are not considered in the past with the

NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailDl PM counter are updated

correctly.

Cell

ranges up to 14,000 m are supported for the

Optimized

Uplink Peak Throughput

High-Band

feature.

Interfaces

If the configured cell range is greater than 4,000 m, an

additional SearchSpace IE instance is configured in the following

IEs:

- PDCCH-Config
- PDCCH-ConfigCommon

If the configured cell range is greater than 4,000 m, the values of the following IEs

are updated:

- PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList
- ServingCellConfigCommon

If the configured cell range is greater than 5,937 m, the following IE uses an

additional special slot pattern:

- TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon

If

the configured cell range is greater than 6,900 m, the NR RRC interface is

affected

in the

following ways:

- Additional UE-specific and common SearchSpace IE instances are configured in the following IEs: PDCCH-Config PDCCH-ConfigCommon
- The following IEs are updated: CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList CSI-ReportConfig CSI-ResourceConfig
- The value of the dmrs-TypeA-Position field in the ServingCellConfigCommon is updated.
- The startSymbolAndLength field is updated for the PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList IE instances.
- The number of PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList IE instances is increased to 16.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Counters

The

effects of this feature improvement can be

measured

through

the Beam.pmRadioRaAttTaDistr PM counter.

Increasing cell range and

checking counters in the different bins can provide measurement

observability information.

For cell ranges

that

exceed

6,900 m, the following PM counters are affected:

- NRCellDU.pmMacContentionDelayDlDistr This PM counter increases because a higher value for K1 is used. This results in increased latency.
- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr This PM counter increases because the wide beam is fixed for periodic scheduling requests in the PRACH slot through the NRCellDU.fixWideBeamsForPeriodicSr attribute. This results in increased latency.
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailDl This PM counter decreases because fewer downlink resources are available. This is because of the increase in the number of gap symbols and RACH extension symbols.
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailUl This PM counter increases because the number of uplink PRBs increases. This is because additional symbols are used for RACH extension.
- EnergyMeter.pmMinPowerConsumption This PM counter increases.
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlots This PM counter decreases because fewer PDSCH resources are available. This is because of the increase in the number of gap symbols and RACH extension symbols.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band

The feature enables the support of Carrier Aggregation and the configuration of cell

range settings.

## 9.1 Cell Range Settings of Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band

The NRCellDU.cellRange attribute determines the cell range and the

number of gap symbols in the special slot. The number of

gap symbols also depends on the type of deployment the feature is used in.

In EN-DC and NR-DC deployments, when the feature license is activated, the special slot

configuration of the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is selected based on the

attribute value as shown in Table 5. Without

feature activation, the cell range value is limited to 1,100 m, and the 10:2:2 TDD

special slot pattern is used.

Table 5   TDD Special Slot Configuration for Each NRCellDU Cell Range in EN-DC and

NR-DC

| NRCellDU Cell Range (m)   | TDD Special Slot Pattern   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0–579                     | 10:2:2                     |
| 580–1,919                 | 9:3:2                      |
| 1,920–3,258               | 8:4:2                      |
| 3,259–4,598               | 7:5:2                      |
| 4,599–5,937               | 6:6:2                      |
| 5,938–6,900               | 5:7:2                      |
| 6,901–14,000              | Slot x3: 0:12:2            |
| 6,901–14,000              | Slot x8: 1:12:1            |

In NR standalone deployments, the special slot configuration of the 4 downlink + 1 uplink

TDD pattern is selected based on the attribute value as shown in Table 6.

For cell ranges

over 1,100 m, the feature must be

activated.

Standalone

| NRCellDU Cell Range (m)   | TDD Special Slot Pattern   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0–579                     | 10:2:2                     |

| 1,920–3,258               | 8:4:2                      |
| 3,259–4,000               | 7:5:2                      |

Cell coverage is limited in a sector by the NRCellDU.cellRange

configuration of the PSCell. If multiple PSCells are in a sector, load distribution

between them requires that their cell range is configured to the same value.

It is required to use the license when the cell range is

above 1,100 m.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement increases cell coverage in High-Band for high-powered FWA

UEs. It introduces the possibility of carrying data traffic up to 6,900 m. This

allows for a larger cell coverage area with the use of fewer sites.

Capacity and Performance

The extension of cell coverage results in additional gap symbols between downlink and

uplink which reduces downlink throughput compared to the configuration where two gap

symbols are used only. The number of gap symbols depends on the configured cell

range.

Table 7   Cell Range Correlations for High-Band Cells

| Cell Range (m)   |   Gap Symbols between Downlink and Uplink in Special Slots | Peak Downlink Throughput Reduction   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 4,001–4,598      |                                                          5 | 13.23%                               |

| 5,938–6,900      |                                                          7 | 20.11%                               |

Periodic scheduling request occasions other than PRACH slots use wide beams for

periodic scheduling request reception. The wide beams are dynamically selected based

on the UE waiting time which lowers UE uplink latency.

This feature improvement can be observed with the

Beam.pmRadioRaAttTaDistr PM counter.

Operation

This feature enhancement affects the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.cellRange
- NRCellDU.fixWideBeamsForPeriodicSr
- NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed

This feature enhancement updates and can raise the Inconsistent

Configuration alarm with the

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                       |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement

increases the

cell

coverage for high-powered FWA UEs in High-Band for EN-DC and NR-DC deployments. This

allows carrying data traffic up to 14,000 m inside the cell.

The benefit of this feature enhancement is that a larger cell coverage area can be

achieved with the same number of radio equipment.

Capacity and Performance

The cell range extension requires additional gap symbols to be configured in special

slots. This reduces downlink throughput. The number of gap symbols depends on the

configured cell range. For a cell range of 6,901-14,000 m, 12 gap symbols are

configured. In this case, the expected downlink throughput reduction is 35% compared

to the configuration where only two gap symbols are used.

This feature enhancement also enables cell ranges up to 14,000 m for the Optimized

Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band feature.

This feature enhancement can be observed through the

Beam.pmRadioRaAttTaDistr PM counter.

This feature enhancement increases the DL RBSym Utilization KPI.

This feature enhancement increases the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacContentionDelayDlDistr

- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailUl

- EnergyMeter.pmMinPowerConsumption

This feature enhancement decreases the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailDl

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlots

Operation

This feature enhancement modifies the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute

to allow the configuration of a cell range up to 14,000 m.

This feature enhancement modifies the Inconsistent

Configuration alarm in the following ways:

- The cellRange=&lt;value&gt; inconsistent with activated features: Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band, Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band. additional text on the NRCellDU MO class is removed.
- The Parameter cellRange value greater than 1100m for High-Band requires parameter rachPreambleFormat value RACH\_PREAMBLE\_FORMAT\_04 additional text on the NRCellDU MO class is replaced by the cellRange=&lt;value&gt; inconsistent with rachPreambleFormat=&lt;value&gt; for High-Band. additional text. PRACH preamble format C2 must be used instead of format A3 for cell ranges 1,101-6,900 m. PRACH preamble format A3 must be used for cell ranges greater than or equal to 6,901 m. If an incorrect PRACH preamble format is configured for these cell ranges, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised during cell unlock with the cellRange=&lt;value&gt; inconsistent with rachPreambleFormat=&lt;value&gt; for High-Band. additional text.

Interfaces

The NR RRC interface is

affected

in the following ways:

- Additional USS and CSS SearchSpace IE instances are configured in the following IEs: PDCCH-Config PDCCH-ConfigCommon
- The following IEs are updated: CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList CSI-ReportConfig CSI-ResourceConfig
- The value of the dmrs-TypeA-Position field in ServingCellConfigCommon is updated.
- The startSymbolAndLength field is updated for PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList IE instances.
- The number of PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList IE instances is increased to 16.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is applicable to the following hardware:

- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 6

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version

24.2

or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this
