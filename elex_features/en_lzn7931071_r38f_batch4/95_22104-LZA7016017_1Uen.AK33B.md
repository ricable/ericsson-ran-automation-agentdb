# 1 Massive MIMO Low-Band Overview

The feature enables cell shaping and flexible cell coverage with common channel

beamforming.

Summary

Common channel beamforming is used for cell shaping. Cell shaping provides flexible cell

coverage for different environments. Capacity and data rate coverage are enhanced by

beamforming.

In the downlink, Massive MIMO supports single-user MIMO with up to four layers. Both

horizontal and vertical beamforming are supported. Codebook-based beamforming is

implemented for better coverage and higher single user peak rate.

Downlink single-user MIMO provides the following benefits:

- The antenna transmits more than one beam to a UE at the same time.
- In poor radio conditions, good coverage can be provided by using only one beam.
- High peak data rates are provided for the cell users by maximizing the use of the radio resources.
- The single-user peak rate increases proportionally with the number of layers.
- The antenna array transmitter power is split between the beams. This means that more beams equal less power for each beam.
- The power split over layers can increase the throughput.

Uplink single-user SIMO provides the following benefits:

- The advanced receiver improves coverage, and reduces the interference in diverse environments.
- Intra-cell and inter-cell interference is reduced by utilizing the large number of transceiver chains.
- Single layer is supported in the uplink.

- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5b
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5c
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5d
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5e

For more information on RAN Compute groups, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

The feature is supported on the following Massive MIMO FDD radio units in single mode

and mixed mode configurations:

- AIR 1641
- AIR 3246
- AIR 3283

Limitations

Digital tilt is only supported on AIR 3246 in macro sector carrier shape.

Remote electrical tilt is only supported on AIR 1641.

TRS Resource Shifting is not supported in the following configurations:

- 5 MHz
- 10 MHz together with downlink CRB blanking by the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature

Reciprocity-based beamforming is not supported in Massive MIMO Low-Band because

Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) is only supported in Mid-Band deployments.

Network Requirements

The feature supports UEs with the following characteristics:

- 8-port CSI-RS support
- 16-port CSI-RS support
- 32-port CSI-RS support
- The following CSI-RS configurations: 8-port CSI-RS+16-port CSI-RS 8-port CSI-RS+32-port CSI-RS
- EN-DC capability
- NR SA capability

# 3 Feature Operation of Massive MIMO Low-Band

The feature uses common channel beamforming weights for transmission.

Common Channel Beamforming Operation

Figure 1   Common Channel Beamforming with Configurable Coverage Shapes

Downlink common channel beamforming weights are used to transmit the following

channels and signals:

- PSS
- SSS
- PBCH
- PDCCH
- PDSCH (before valid PMI)
- The associated DMRSs

The PDSCH is transmitted using the downlink common channel beamforming weights when

no PMI is available. Otherwise, it is transmitted using PMI-based beamforming for

single-user MIMO.

Uplink common channel beamforming weights are used to receive the following channels

and signals:

- PRACH
- PUCCH
- The associated DMRSs

Downlink Single-User MIMO Operation

With downlink single-user MIMO, the antenna can transmit more than one PDSCH layer to

a single UE. The single-user peak rate increases proportionally with the number of

layers.

Figure 2   Single-User MIMO

Single-user MIMO is supported with up to four layers in cells with the following

bandwidths:

- 5MHz
- 10MHz
- 15MHz
- 20MHz
- 25 MHz
- 30MHz
- 35MHz

The single-user MIMO function is a closed loop scheme

based on single-panel codebook feedback. For this scheme, standardized codebooks for

precoding are defined for each allowed rank under each codebook configuration.

Different precoding weights in the codebooks direct power toward different relative

angles of departure in reference to the gNodeB antenna array boresight. The gNodeB

periodically provides the following resources to connected UEs:

- CSI-RS
- CSI-IM

The UEs send CSI feedback reports over the PUSCH aperiodically. These reports

sent by the UE consist of the following parameters:

- CQI, indicating the channel quality
- RI, indicating the preferred rank
- PMI, indicating the preferred precoding weight from the codebook associated with the preferred rank

Using the CSI feedback, the gNodeB formulates the

downlink signal including the precoding weight. A link adaptation algorithm chooses

the transmitted MCS level.

The following CSI-RS resources are available:

- 8-port CSI-RS
- 16-port CSI-RS
- 32-port CSI-RS

CSI-RS resources using 8, 16, or 32 ports can be enabled and associated with codebook

configurations by configuring the following parameters:

- The csiRsControl8Ports member of the NRCellDU.csiRsConfig8P attribute
- The csiRsControl16Ports member of the NRCellDU.csiRsConfig16P attribute
- The csiRsControl32Ports member of the NRCellDU.csiRsConfig32P attribute

Codebook subset restrictions that are defined in 3GPP TS 38.214 can be

configured for the codebooks that are identified for each enabled CSI-RS resource.

The codebook subset restrictions can be configured with the

i11Restriction and the i12Restriction

members in the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.csiRsConfig8P
- NRCellDU.csiRsConfig16P
- NRCellDU.csiRsConfig32P

The configuration is based on specifying the values that are allowed for certain PMI

components. With codebook subset restrictions, the gNodeB can indicate precoding

weights to the UE (in UE RRC configuration) that are forbidden for indication in UE

CSI reporting. These precoding weights in the codebooks represent specific

directions for use in downlink transmissions.

The codebook configuration and the corresponding codebook subset restrictions must be

chosen to suit the deployment cases.

It is also possible to restrict the UE from sending certain

Rank Indicators. The Rank Indicator restriction can be set with the

NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction MO attribute. Depending on

the value of this attribute, the UEs in a Low-Band or Mid-Band cell can be restricted

from sending Rank Indicators for a specific rank or any arbitrary combination of

ranks.

Certain sites might benefit from a Rank Indicator restriction, for example where the High

Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled.

## 3.1 CSI-RS and TRS Resource Shifting

CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting can mitigate the negative effects

of CSI-RS and TRS interference.

Continuous CSI-RS and TRS broadcasts can affect the downlink performance

in adjacent cells in regions with significant inter-cell interference, for example cell

edges. If adjacent cells use the same CSI-RS and TRS resource allocations in such

regions, downlink performance can be degraded.

Depending on the UE implementation, CSI-RS and TRS interference can have

the following consequences:

- Decreased downlink throughput
- Decreased downlink decoding performance
- Incorrect CSI feedback
- Increased downlink BLER

The negative effects of CSI-RS and TRS interference can be mitigated by

enabling CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting. When applied to a network

with appropriate PCI planning, these functions allow different CSI-RS and TRS resource

allocations to be used in adjacent cells.

Both CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting rely on PCI planning, which

maximizes the reuse distance for all values of PCI modulo 6.

Using CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting can have the

following trade-offs:

- Fewer resources can be available for PDSCH in TRS slots.
- The CSI-RS on PDSCH interference can degrade the PDSCH SINR, which can increase downlink BLER slightly.

In some UE chipsets, the CSI-RS interference mitigation function reduces inaccurate PMI

reporting that can happen in poor radio frequency conditions.
