# 1 Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band Overview

The feature improves uplink peak throughput during low load by using RACH, SR-PUCCH, and

PUCCH symbols for PUSCH when possible.

Summary

The licensed feature increases uplink throughput in the following cases:

- In networks with few users in good radio conditions by using unused RACH and SR-PUCCH symbols for PUSCH for the PSCell and SCell.
- In networks with low downlink traffic by using unused PUCCH symbols for PUSCH for the PSCell and SCell.

The improvement in uplink throughput decreases gradually as the number of connected

users and the amount of traffic activity increases.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the change, ENM version 21.08 or later is required.

# 3 Feature Operation of Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

The feature is triggered automatically

for each TTI, by extending the PUSCH slot with more PUSCH symbols, when the conditions are

fulfilled.

The feature increases uplink throughput in the following cases:

- In networks with few users in good radio conditions, by making use of unused RACH and scheduling requests on PUCCH symbols for PUSCH for the PSCell and SCell. This functionality can be deactivated above a certain number of connected users per PSCell by the NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch attribute.
- In networks with low downlink traffic, by making use of unused PUCCH symbols for PUSCH, for the PSCell and SCell.

PRACH symbols are configured for transmission of RACH "msg1" from the UE.

RACH must be decoded in the following cases:

- During SCG addition, on any wide beam. For an NSA solution, this is initiated by the F1 UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message from the MCG.
- During scheduling request on RACH, on a specific wide beam. Scheduling request on RACH is a fallback mecahnism if the transmission of the periodic scheduling request on PUCCH is unsuccessful.Note: This can only happen in wide beams where the UEs are in poor radio channel quality conditions.

In TTIs where RACH decoding is not present, the gNodeB can schedule PUSCH on PRACH

symbols instead.

If there is only one connected user in the cell, and the PRACH symbols are scheduled

as PUSCH, the scheduling request on PUCCH symbol is also used for scheduling PUSCH.

If there is little downlink traffic, PUCCH symbols are unused and can be used for

scheduling PUSCH transmissions.

If the Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature is activated, the Optimized

Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band feature supports cell ranges up to 14,000 m.

# 4 Network Impact of Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

When the feature is activated, an increase in uplink throughput can be

expected.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enables increased uplink throughput, but this improvement decreases

gradually as the number of connected users and the amount of traffic activity

increases.

No performance impact is expected on RACH and PUCCH.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

An attribute is introduced to configure the maximum number of connected users for

scheduling PUSCH on RACH symbols.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                       | Type       | Description          |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

This feature introduces PM counters and updates an event.

KPIs

The gNodeB Contention-Based Random Access Success Rate is expected to be increased

because of the decreased number of Random Access preambles.

Counters

The following PM counters are introduced to track the number of PUCCH and RACH

symbols that are used for PUSCH:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymRachSchedPusch
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymPucchSchedPusch

Events

The DuPerCellResourceRep event is updated with two event

parameters for the following reasons:

- To track the aggregated number of resource block symbols where PSCell is configured for RACH but the symbols are used for scheduling on PUSCH.
- To track the aggregated number of resource block symbols in uplink slots where PSCell is configured for PUCCH but the symbols are used for scheduling on PUSCH.

# 7 Activate Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012535 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012535 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band

The NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch MO limits the use of RACH

symbols as PUSCH during high load.

During high traffic load (and many connected UEs), there is an increased probability of

UEs attempting to request uplink grant through scheduling request on RACH. This might

happen at the same time as the symbols are scheduled for PUSCH. To minimize this risk,

the NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch attribute explicitly limits the

use of RACH symbols as PUSCH during high load.
