Hardware

The feature only supports NR Mid-Band AAS TDD eCPRI radios.

Limitations

The number of configurable nulls is limited by the degrees of freedom available in

each dimension of the antenna array. Based on the available configuration

possibilities, other limitations can apply. For more information, see Baseband Parameter and Counter Limitations for NR.

Network Requirements

The feature requires ENM version 21.2 or later.

# 3 Feature Operation of Directional Interference Mitigation

The feature allows the configuration of spatial nulls in the radiation pattern to reduce

EIRP in certain directions.

The feature allows the configuration of spatial nulls in the radiation pattern based on

azimuth angles, elevation angles, or both. A spatial null in the radiation pattern is an

area in which the EIRP is reduced.

The following characteristics of a spatial null can be configured:

| Spatial Null Characteristics   | Configurable Parameters                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

(1)

If a null is configured for a certain frequency, the

direction might slightly change for adjacent

frequencies. By default, the value of the

frequency member is 0 and the

null is applied for the center frequency of the

carrier.

Direction of the Configured Nulls

As Figure 1 shows, the following angles can

be used to describe the direction of the configured nulls:

| verticalAngle (θ)   |    | The vertical angle relative to the transverse plane passing through                                 the center of the antenna array. Shown as theta angle. Positive                                 values cause the null to be aimed downward and negative values cause                                 the null to be aimed upward.   |
|---------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| horizontalAngle (φ) |    | The horizontal angle relative to the sagittal plane passing through                                 the center of the antenna array. Shown as phi angle. Looking from                                 above, positive values aim the null clockwise and negative values                                 aim the null counterclockwise.  |

Figure 1   Angles Shown in a 3D Coordinate System

In vertical null steering, a null configured for a certain

verticalAngle value is applicable for all

horizontalAngle values. This is why the

horizontalAngle member is absent from the

NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attribute. Figure 2 shows a single elevation null at

verticalAngle = 5

Figure 2   Radiation Pattern Heat Map with a Single Vertical Null

In horizontal null steering, a null configured for a certain

horizontalAngle value is not always applicable for every

verticalAngle value. If observed in theta and phi surface,

as shown in Figure 3, horizontal null

steering generates an azimuth null with a circle-like shape that goes through the

intersection of the configured verticalAngle and

horizontalAngle. The only exception in horizontal null

steering is when horizontalAngle = 0. In this case, a null

strip is generated in the center of the radiation pattern, which is the broadside

direction of the antenna array.

At least 30 degrees of separation is required between two null directions to have

reasonable coverage between the two nulls.

As an example, Figure 3 shows the following

nulls:

- Azimuth nulls: (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (0, 0) (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (40, 20) (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (10, −40)
- Elevation null: verticalAngle = 0

The width of the nulls is configured to NARROW in the

nullWidth member of the corresponding

NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull and

NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes.

Figure 3   Radiation Pattern Heat Map with Four Generated Nulls

The following null characteristics can be observed in the example given in Figure 3:

- The generated elevation null at verticalAngle = 0 is available for all horizontalAngle values.
- The generated azimuth null at horizontalAngle = 0 is available for all verticalAngle values.
- The generated azimuth nulls at (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (40, 20) and (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (10, −40) are not available at all verticalAngle values. These are nulls with circle-like shapes that pass through the configured direction.

# 4 Network Impact of Directional Interference Mitigation

The feature can affect the cell throughput and the number of handovers in the

cell.

Capacity and Performance

EIRP is reduced towards the null direction on selected downlink channels based on MO

configuration. This can cause the following effects:

- Cell throughput can be reduced because of the generated null.
- The number of handovers might increase in cells with one or more configured nulls.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Directional Interference Mitigation

The feature introduces attributes to configure the null characteristics. Attributes

that control beamforming can affect the feature

configuration.

# 6 Performance of Directional Interference Mitigation

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, and

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Directional Interference Mitigation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure, then the relevant attributes must be configured.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012536 MO instance.
2. Configure the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull, the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull, or both attributes.
3. If applicable, configure the NRSectorCarrier.nullSteeringMode attribute.

After This Task

- Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Directional Interference Mitigation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. The relevant attributes must be set to empty.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. The NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull and the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes must be set to empty.
2. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012536 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Directional Interference Mitigation

Certain criteria must be met during configuration.

The following guidelines must be followed when configuring the feature:

- If applicable, the CommonBeamforming.coverageShape attribute must be set to MACRO\_1 and the CommonBeamforming.customComBfwWideBeam attribute must be set to empty.
- The maximum allowed number of configured NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes is three and the maximum allowed configured NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes is one. This is to limit the degradation of the radiation pattern. The degrees of freedom of the available antenna ports can further limit the number of configurable nulls.
- When setting a horizontal null, the value of the horizontalAngle member of the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attribute must be set between −60 and 60. However, the recommendation is to set the value between −45 and 45 to reduce the chance of generating an unwanted null in the radiation pattern.
- At least 30 degrees of separation is required between two null directions to have reasonable coverage between the two nulls.

## 9.1 Antenna Degrees of Freedom

The degrees of freedom in each direction of the antenna array limit the number of

physical nulls the antenna can generate.

The number of generated physical nulls is not always equal to the number of the

configured NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull or

NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes.

The number of the generated physical nulls depends on the setting of the

nullWidth member of the corresponding

NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull or

NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes. For certain values,

more than one adjacent physical nulls are generated. Table 2 shows the actual number of the physical

nulls generated with different configurations:

Table 2   Number of Physical Nulls Generated for Each Configuration

| nullWidth Value   | Width   |   Number of Generated Physical Nulls |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| <0>               | NARROW  |                                    1 |
| <1>               | MEDIUM  |                                    2 |
| <2>               | WIDE    |                                    3 |

The maximum number of physical nulls is influenced by the following characteristics:

- The number of ports in the azimuth and elevation axes of the given antenna array
- The setting of the nullSteeringMode attribute

The N1 and N2 values depend on the current configuration of the

NRCellDU.CsiRsConfig*P attribute. For more information on CSI-RS

configurations, see Manage Massive MIMO NR.

For example, Figure 4 shows an antenna array that

has ports ranging from port 0 to port 7 on the azimuth axis and ports ranging from port

0 to port 3 on the elevation axis. In this case, the maximum allowed number of generated

physical azimuth nulls is seven and the maximum allowed number of generated physical

elevation nulls is three.

Figure 4   Example Antenna Array

The following examples show configurations that are allowed with the antenna array shown

in Figure 4 with the

nullSteeringMode member configured to

COMMON\_BEAMFORMING:

- Three NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes with NARROW settings: Nulls with NARROW setting generate one physical null for each MO attribute. This configuration is allowed because 1 + 1 + 1 ≤ 7.
- Two NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes with MEDIUM settings: Nulls with MEDIUM setting generate two physical nulls for each MO attribute and nulls with WIDE setting generate three physical nulls per MO attribute. This configuration is allowed because 2 + 2 ≤ 7.

The following example shows a configuration that is not allowed with an antenna array

shown in Figure 4:

- Three NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes with WIDE settings: Nulls with WIDE setting generate three physical nulls for each MO attribute. This configuration is not allowed because 3 + 3 + 3 &gt; 7.

Elevation Null Interaction with Digital Tilt

If an antenna does not have enough degrees of freedom on the elevation axis, the

previously configured digital tilt is not preserved when an elevation null is

applied.

For example, AIR 3239 has two subarrays on the elevation axis and therefore it has

one degree of freedom in elevation. This means that even if a

NARROW elevation null is applied to this antenna, the radiation

pattern with the null overrides the previously configured digital tilt and the

digital tilt is lost.

However, if the antenna has enough degrees of freedom on the elevation axis, the

previously configured digital tilt is preserved when an elevation null is applied.

For example, AIR 6449 has four subarrays on the elevation axis and therefore it has

three degrees of freedom in elevation. This means that if a NARROW elevation null is

applied to this antenna, the previously configured digital tilt is preserved.

## 9.2 Pattern File Examples for AIR 3239 B78G
