Summary

The NR Relative Priority Scheduling feature supports prioritization between UEs. The priority

of a UE is based on the following factors:

- Subscription by using the slice concept
- Needs of the currently used services

NSA and SA UEs can

be configured separately by using the slice concept. Prioritization between the DRBs of a UE is

also possible if specific active services are properly prioritized. This means that

a larger number of UEs can be serviced adequately. The feature ensures that services

with higher priority requirements are served with the required priority.

The feature provides relative priority, not relative throughput. The user with the higher

relative priority has higher access to the spectrum and has a higher throughput

without starving the other user.

Additional Information

For more information on QoS and 5QI, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 28.552; Management and Orchestration; 5G Performance Measurements

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.1 or later is required for this feature.

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for PDB interaction

support.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Relative Priority Scheduling

The feature uses scheduling weight to give bearers relative priority.

The feature operates at a bearer level with a relative priority range of 1-256. Modifying

the MOM configuration of bearer priority is possible at any time, but the change only

takes effect at a new DRB setup.

Priority Calculation

At relative prioritization, the weight of a bearer is determined by the following

values:

- Priority domain of the bearer
- Scheduling weight within the priority domain

The weight slope causes the scheduling weight to increase over time at a certain rate

during waiting. The scheduling weight is affected by at least one of the following

factors:

- The configured relative priority
- The PDB

By configuring a different relative priority for each 5QI and QCI, it is possible to

adjust how fast the scheduling weight increases for each 5QI and QCI.

Relative priority has no effect on retransmissions. This results in retransmissions

having a higher priority than new data in the DRB buffer.

## 3.1 UE Grouping for Priority Scheduling

The UE Grouping for Priority Scheduling function enables the modification of QoS

parameters for a UE group created through the UE Grouping Framework.

The DUQosModifier MO can be created manually.

Instances of the following MOs can be created manually:

- DUModified5qi
- DUModified5qiUeCfg

The instances of the DUModified5qiUeCfg MO are differentiated by the

following MO attributes:

- DUModified5qiUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueConfGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueGroupList

If either of the attributes in the DUModified5qiUeCfg MO is

empty, the original value is not modified.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Relative Priority Scheduling

This feature enables more granular priority configuration for DRBs compared to

absolute priority, which can optimize

performance.

Capacity and Performance

The feature affects performance based on the configuration. Bearers with a higher

relative priority get access to available resources more frequently than bearers

with lower relative priority.

Services with higher priority requirements are served with the required priority.

The relative priority provides a more refined impact on the low priority users with a

lower risk of high priority users overtaking resources.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

MOM configuration rule in three MO classes. With this change, the affected classes apply the

MOM configuration rule that is required by the UE Grouping Framework.

Summary and Benefits

MO classes that are adapted to the UE Grouping Framework feature contain a standard

set of UE group list attributes and a standard set of MOM configuration rules, which

enforce the correct setting of the UE group list attributes. This feature

enhancement introduces a non-backward-compatible change for one of the MOM

configuration rules related to the three affected MO classes, which are already

adapted to the UE Grouping Framework. This is to comply with the corresponding

standard UE Grouping Framework configuration rule.

The affected attributes comply with the following standard MOM configuration rule

after the change:

- For each preference UE group identifier that is defined in one or several UeCfg MO instances apart from the Base instance, there must be exactly one UeCfg MO instance that combines the specific preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute with an empty ueGroupList attribute.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The change affects the following MO classes and attributes:

- DUModified5qiUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList

No upgrade conversion of the configuration is made by the system during node

upgrade.

The first time the MOM configuration rule is enforced after a software upgrade is

when a configuration transaction contains any changes related to the affected

UeCfg MO classes. This is true even if the configuration

transaction does not affect any values related to the

prefUeGroupList or the ueGroupList

attributes. This means that an existing configuration that does not comply with the

updated configuration rules is still used after the software update. The

non-compliant configuration is detected by the system only if a configuration

transaction affecting the MO classes is initiated.

The enforcement of the updated configuration rule causes behavior changes. The most

common examples are the following:

- Any MO transaction that contains configuration changes related to any of the affected UeCfg MO classes must always fulfill the updated configuration rule.
- It is not possible to create a UeCfg MO instance if the following conditions apply: The prefUeGroupList attribute includes a new preference UE group identifier, which is not included in any of the existing UeCfg MO instances and their prefUeGroupList attributes. The ueGroupList attribute is non-empty. The only exception is if the same MO transaction also includes the creation of a second UeCfg MO instance with the same new preference UE group identifier in the uePrefGroupList attribute combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute for this UeCfg MO instance.
- It is not possible to delete a UeCfg MO instance if the following conditions apply: The MO instance contains a preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute. There is another UeCfg MO instance with the same preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute combined with a non-empty ueGroupList attribute. The only exception is if both MO instances are deleted in the same MO transaction.
- If the prefUeGroupList attribute is empty with no previous configurations for all UeCfg MO instances, there is no impact.
