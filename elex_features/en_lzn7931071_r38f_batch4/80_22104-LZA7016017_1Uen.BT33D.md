# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Single-User MIMO

The feature enables uplink transmission for one or two layers.

The feature uses SINR measurements to determine if transmission over two layers is

possible for supported UEs. If the SINR crosses a predefined threshold, the feature

reconfigures the UE automatically. For more information, see Dynamic Uplink Switching Options.

Figure 1   Port and Layer Switching Based on SINR Measurement

Port and Layer Switching Process Based on SINR Measurement

The feature uses the following process to configure the UE for transmission over two

layers:

1. The gNodeB schedules the UE for one-port transmission by default during RRC setup.
2. The UE reports two-port capability to the gNodeB.
3. The UE starts traffic.
4. The gNodeB reconfigures the UE for two ports with RRC reconfiguration if the SINR is above the predefined threshold.
5. The gNodeB schedules the UE for transmission over one or two layers in the upcoming uplink slots.

## 3.1 Dynamic Uplink Switching Options

The feature supports dynamic switching options to adapt to changing channel

conditions. Switching is determined by using SINR measurements and occurs if the SINR

crosses a predefined threshold.

The following uplink switching options are supported:

- Layer switching
- TX port switching
- Waveform switching

Switching from two layer to transmission over one layer is also supported based on DTX

observations by the gNodeB. For more information, see Uplink Layer Switching for Dual SIM Dual Active UEs.

Port switching can be configured with the

UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulPortSwitchFr1Mode attribute for different

UE groups and power classes.

If the UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulLayerSwitchQualThresh attribute is set

for full-power transmission UE power class in the case of 2Ports1layer configuration,

there is a compensation for non-full-power transmission UE power class like TDD

PC1.5.

If the UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulLayerSwitchQualThresh attribute is set

for non-full-power transmission UE power class like TDD PC1.5 in the case of

2Ports1Layer configuration, the values used for port switching and layer switching keep

the same value. Otherwise, performance might degrade. For more information about UE

groups, see UE Grouping Framework. For more information about UE power

classes, see NR

Standalone.

SINR measurements are used for port switching by comparing threshold and hysteresis. The

ulPortSwitchTimeToTrigger attribute is used to avoid frequent UE

reconfiguring.

The timer uses the ulPortSwitchTimeToTrigger attribute to ensure that

the SINR crosses the threshold stably.

The gNodeB uses the following configuration in good channel conditions:

- Two-layer uplink transmission for capable UEs
- Two-port transmission
- CP-OFDM waveform transmission

The gNodeB uses the following configuration in poor channel conditions:

- Single-layer transmission
- Single-port transmission
- DFTS-OFDM waveform transmission if possibleNote: The DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink feature must be activated to enable using the DFTS-OFDM waveform. Otherwise, the CP-OFDM waveform is used in poor channel conditions as well.

The configurations for these use cases are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Configurations for Good and Poor Channel Conditions

## 3.2 Uplink Layer Switching for Dual SIM Dual Active UEs

This feature supports layer switching when one of the Tx ports of a Dual SIM Dual

Active (DSDA) UE is muted.

A DSDA UE can use two active SIM cards at the same time. If the Uplink Single-User MIMO

feature is activated on the gNodeB, DSDA UEs with two Tx ports can support transmission

over two uplink layers.

Sometimes, a DSDA UE might suddenly remove its two-layer capability. This can happen, for

example, when the UE handles an LTE call, or when it mutes one of its Tx ports for some

other reason. Muting a Tx port means that the UE does not use that port for the NR cell,

that is no NR signal is sent on that port.

This feature allows the gNodeB to detect when a UE Tx port is muted. When a Tx port is

muted, the gNodeB switches to transmission over one layer. Later, the gNodeB checks

whether transmission can be resumed over two ports.

An optimal operational process is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. This process shows a scenario

when the gNodeB detects whether a UE Tx port is muted and applies layer switching

accordingly.

Figure 3   Uplink Layer Switching to Transmission over One Layer

Figure 4   Uplink Layer Switching to Transmission over Two Layers

1. When the UE is configured for transmission over two layers, the gNodeB checks whether one of the Tx ports of the UE is muted.
2. If one port is muted, the following actions are taken:
    1. The gNodeB starts a timer. Note: The timer duration is different for each TDD pattern.
    2. The gNodeB schedules the UE for transmission over one layer.
3. When the timer expires, the gNodeB tries to schedule transmission over two layers for the UE. If this is successful, the gNodeB continues to schedule the UE for transmission over two layers.
4. If not successful, the timer is restarted.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Single-User MIMO

The feature increases uplink throughput and can provide better cell coverage in poor

channel conditions.

Capacity and Performance

The feature can provide the following benefits:

- Better cell coverage for UEs on the cell edge with adaptive waveform switching.
- Double peak throughput for UEs capable of two-layer uplink transmission.
- Increased uplink spectrum efficiency and cell throughput.

For waveform switching, retainability can degrade because of the additional RRC

signaling for data inactive UEs in poor SINR conditions.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of Uplink Single-User MIMO

Port switching can be configured for each UE group with an attribute. The feature is

affected by attributes that control the use of waveforms. The maximum number of layers for

each UE is restricted if support for high-speed UEs is enabled in the cell.

## Appendix A.b: 22.Q2: Uplink Layer Switching Support for Dual SIM Dual Active UEs

This feature enhancement introduces support for layer switching when one of the Tx

ports of a Dual SIM Dual Active (DSDA) UE is muted.

| Feature Name           | Uplink Single-User MIMO   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5234              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005              |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type            | NR                        |

Summary and Benefits

A DSDA UE can use two SIM cards and keep them active at the same time. If the Uplink

Single-User MIMO feature is activated on the gNodeB, DSDA UEs with two Tx ports can

support transmission over two uplink layers.

Uplink performance can degrade when a DSDA UE suddenly removes its two-layer

capability. This can happen, for example, when the UE handles an LTE call, or when

it mutes one of its Tx ports for some other reason. Muting a Tx port means that the

UE does not use that port for the NR cell, that is no NR signal is sent on that

port.

To limit the performance degradation, this feature enhancement introduces a solution

to detect when a UE Tx port is muted. When the gNodeB detects that a UE Tx port is

muted, it switches to transmission over one layer. Later, the gNodeB checks whether

transmission can be resumed over two ports.

With this feature enhancement, the uplink performance degradation is mitigated when

the UE suddenly mutes one of its Tx ports. The feature enhancement is applicable for

Mid-Band deployments.

Capacity and Performance

When this function is applied, the number of required retransmissions for the UE is

lower. This means that the modulation and coding scheme for the UE can be higher. As

a result, throughput-related and BLER-related KPIs and PIs are improved. This

improvement can only be observed for UEs with two-layer and DSDA capability, during

the case described in Summary and Benefits.

The following ACK-related PM counters are increased, while the corresponding

NACK-related PM counters are decreased at the same time:

- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAckQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAck16Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAck64Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAck256Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNackQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNack16Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNack64Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNack256Qam

As a result, the following BLER-related PIs are improved:

- UL BLER per modulation for all HARQ transmissions Formula: 100 × pmMacHarqUlNackMod / (pmMacHarqUlNackMod + pmMacHarcUlAckMod)
- UL BLER per modulation for initial HARQ transmissions Formula: 100 × pmMacHarqUlNackModInit / (pmMacHarqUlNackModInit + pmMacHarcUlAckModInit)

The NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl PM counter is increased. As a result the

following KPIs related to this counter are also improved:

- Normalized Average UL MAC Cell Throughput considering successful PUSCH slot only
- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput - fixed time normalized
- Normalized UL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PUSCH slot only
- Average UL MAC UE Throughput

Operation

The NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschMimoLayerDistr PM counter is

modified to step correctly for bin[1], so generally the counter is stepped less

frequently for this bin.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement updates the algorithm for the selection of the uplink serving

cell set in Mid-Band and Low-Band to jointly consider cells, bandwidths, MIMO

layers, and uplink 1TX-2TX switching.

The selection algorithm for the serving cell set selects between uplink

MIMO,

uplink carrier

aggregation,

and uplink 1TX-2TX switching based on uplink weights. Uplink

weight depends on uplink layer coverage with the feature enhancement.

The Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR Traffic Steering feature is updated

to ensure that if the UE is in bad coverage where uplink SU-MIMO is not beneficial,

the UE is reconfigured to use uplink carrier aggregation with a Mid-Band and a

Low-Band component carrier. The feature enhancement enables the Multi-Layer

Coordination function to consider uplink layer coverage along with uplink weights

for the selection of the serving cell set.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum
- Improved uplink UE throughput

Capacity and Performance

In a network where both the Uplink Single-User MIMO and the NR Uplink Carrier

Aggregation features are enabled and UEs support both features, the updated

algorithm might lead to the selection of different serving cell sets, which might

impact uplink performance. If the bandwidth of the Mid-Band cell is large enough

compared to the bandwidth of the Low-Band cell, uplink SU-MIMO is initially selected

instead of uplink carrier aggregation with a Mid-Band and a Low-Band component

carrier with the updated algorithm.

The Average UL MAC UE Throughput KPI might improve.

Operation

The feature enhancement uses the

TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpUl2lCoverageThrOffset

attribute for coverage measurements in the current PCell and candidate PCell to

determine uplink two-layer coverage during the evaluations of the Multi-Layer

Coverage function.

The feature enhancement uses the

CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute to select

the configuration mode when the UE is selected with a band combination for uplink

carrier aggregation or uplink 1TX-2TX switching. The configuration mode can be

selected for the uplink aspect of the SCell and PCell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement is not supported for RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group

5e.
