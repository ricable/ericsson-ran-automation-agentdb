# 1 Radio Dot System NR Overview

The Radio Dot System feature (FAJ 121 5022) enables NR support on Radio Dot System

(RDS) and is supported by Low-Band and Mid-Band.

| Access Type:            | NR                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5022                                                                                           |

| Licensing:              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                     node. |

The Radio Dot System NR consists of high capacity Radio Dots and Indoor Radio Units

(IRUs). For the supported number of carriers, carrier bandwidth, operating bandwidth,

IBW, frequency range, detailed RAT support, and mixed mode configurations, refer to

Supported Radio Capabilities, 1/2134-LZA 701 6001.

The IRU and Radio Dots are connected through a shielded CAT6A cable or hybrid cable

carrying IQ streams, proprietary control link, and power over Ethernet for the Radio

Dot. This link is of Ethernet type.

NR comes with two paths to 5G: NR Non-standalone (NSA) and NR Standalone (SA). Operators

can opt for either (or both) when transitioning from 4G to 5G.

- The NR NSA option allows operators to leverage their existing 4G network assets rather than deploying a completely new end-to-end 5G network. The initial NR deployments are based on NR NSA Option 3X that supports the deployment solution E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC). Option 3x represents a network with both LTE and NR radio access, whereby control plane traffic is always processed through the EPC core of LTE, and both LTE and NR are used for user data traffic (user plane). Terminals supporting dual connectivity are always connected to LTE RAN, and can connect to the NR RAN, if available. The terminals can have multiple Radio Access Bearers (RABs) simultaneously with corresponding Data Radio Bearer (DRBs) for different services. The NR RAN boosts network performance for NR-capable UEs.
- The NR SA option 2, which does not rely on LTE, includes a new radio along with the 5GC (IP-based core network between the RAN and other networks), comprising virtualized cloud-native architecture (CNA) that introduces new ways to develop, deploy, and manage services. The NR Standalone (SA) network can be deployed independently or together with an existing LTE or NR NSA network.

There are three possible types of UEs (LTE UE, EN-DC Capable UE, and NR SA UE) with

varied network capabilities. Within the supported networks, the UE selects the default

network to camp on. SA UEs and EN-DC capable UEs are backwards compatible.

Capacity and Performance

For Radio Dot capacity and performance information, refer to Radio Dot Description (7/1551-FGB 101 0308/1).

For IRU capacity and performance information, refer to Indoor Radio Unit Description (

8/1553-FGB 101 0308/1).

Operation

Each sector carrier supports one NR radio cell. For supported number of carriers, carrier

bandwidth, operating bandwidth, IBW, frequency range, detailed RAT support, and mixed

mode configurations, refer to Supported

Radio Capabilities, 1/2134-LZA 701 6001.

The NR Downlink Aggregation feature, FAJ 121 5201, enables higher downlink data

throughput by aggregating the bandwidth of multiple component carriers to serve a

carrier aggregation-capable UE. A maximum of two NR CCs can be aggregated.

When the LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation feature, FAJ 121 4912, is enabled, different user

plane data can be sent in downlink on the Primary Cell Group (PCG) and Secondary Cell

Group (SCG) radio resources of the secondary node terminated split bearer. The

combination of up to six LTE carriers with one NR carrier in Low-Band or Mid-Band

results in higher user speed in the network when using split bearers. The LTE-NR

Downlink Aggregation feature maximizes the coverage and the end user throughput. It also

handles imbalance and variations in capacity and delay on both the MCG and SCG radio

resources.

The Radio Dot System NR reuses the existing architecture, offers the same ease of

installation and flexibility allowing for easy upgrades from existing Radio Dot Systems,

and maintains functional parity and integration with Ericsson Radio System.

Mixed Mode

RDS supports FDD and TDD Mixed Mode.

For detailed information about Mixed Mode support in RDS, refer to Multi-Standard Mixed

Mode (8/1553-FGB 101 0308/1).

Ericsson Spectrum Sharing (ESS)

Ericsson Spectrum Sharing (ESS) enables the introduction of NR in a spectrum used by LTE

FDD. ESS dynamically shares spectrum and same bandwidth between LTE and 5G based on

traffic demand.

For detailed information about ESS support in RDS, refer to Ericsson Spectrum Sharing

(ESS) (29/1553-FGB 101 0308/1).

Hardware

The access side requires the use of specific Baseband units, radios, and Radio Dots for

the LTE side and for NR side, respectively.

For details on supported hardware and compatibility, refer to Supported Radio

Capabilities (1/2134-LZA 701 6001).

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

### 2.2.2 Baseband Licenses

Licenses Required for NR NSA on the Baseband Running eNodeB

The following licenses are required for NR NSA on the Baseband running eNodeB:

- Basic Intelligence Connectivity (FAJ 121 4843) introduces the support for EUTRA - NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) in the eNodeB being the Master Node in the EN-DC deployment.

The following capacity license for channel BW must be applied to EnodeB:

Table 6   LTE Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz

| Feature Name                | Feature Key   | FAJ        | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| LTE Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz | CXC4012367    | FAK1010157 | This is mandatory capacity HWAC on LTE Baseband. |

The LTE Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz license replaces the legacy capacity licenses for

channel BW. Increments of 5 MHz Channel Bandwidth now use only one key (CXC 401

2367) as shown in the following table:

Table 7   One Key (CXC 401 2367) for Capacity Licenses

| License                  | Legacy Key ID   | New Key ID   |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Channel BandWidth 5 MHz  | CXC4010627      | 1*CXC4012367 |
| Channel BandWidth 10 MHz | CXC4010718      | 2*CXC4012367 |
| Channel BandWidth 15 MHz | CXC4010719      | 3*CXC4012367 |
| Channel BandWidth 20 MHz | CXC4010720      | 4*CXC4012367 |

The LTE Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz license (CXC4012367-FAK1010157) cannot be ordered.

Operators must re-apply for their old channel bandwidth license. Both the old and

the new Channel Bandwidth HWAC capacity are included in the new License Key license

File (LKF).

For example, for 3 LTE TDD Channel Bandwidth 20 MHz (CXC 401 0720), Ericsson

Electronic Licensing Solution (ELIS) will generate an LKF containing 3 x CXC 401

0720 and, additionally, 12 x CXC 401 2367.

From 19.29, the old license key for Channel Bandwidth HWAC is no longer supported.

The LKF used at upgrade must be regenerated and must contain the new key CXC 401

2367. The new LKF file must be installed prior to upgrade in order to avoid loss of

service.

If a node is running with an old license and bandwidth expansion is not required, the

LKF used at upgrade must be regenerated, and new license CXC 401 2367 will be

automatically added.

If the LTE Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz license is not applied, or applied but not

activated with the required quantity, FDD cell is in disabled state and the

following alarm is generated:

Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the Key EUtranCellFDD=1

(Shortage of LTE Channel Bandwidth)

Licenses Required for NR NSA on the Baseband Running NR

![Image](../images/7_22104-FGB1010308_1Uen.H2E/additional_3_CP.png)

![Image](../images/7_22104-FGB1010308_1Uen.H2E/additional_3_CP.png)

The following licenses are required for NR NSA on the Baseband running NR:

- NR License for RDS (FAJ 121 5022)
- NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier for Low/Mid-Band (FAJ 121 4930) (increments of 10 MHz)
- NR FDD Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz (FAK 101 0153)
- NR TDD Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz (FAK 101 0154)
- LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation (FAJ 121 4912)
- CPRI Compression (FAJ 121 4632) is required if implementing 100 MHz NR carrier.

### 2.2.3 Core Network Licenses

Multiple licensed features are required at the packet core side to enable NR NSA with

Option 3x. These requirements apply if Ericsson EPC nodes are used.

Table 8   Features Required by Ericsson EPC Nodes to Support NR NSA with Option 3x

| Feature                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Impacted EPC Nodes       | Product Number    |

# 3 Radio Dot System NR Feature Operation

This section describes the features supported by Radio Dot System NR and configuration

aspects.

## 3.1 NR NSA

Non-Standalone (NSA) deployment implies an E-UTRA Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) that

addresses a deployment with indoor sites that combine LTE as an anchor and NR as

additional connectivity for user benefits. This deployment option, known as option 3x,

involves the use of the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) used with LTE. This EPC is the

anchoring for the NR side of the access network.

Figure 1   NR NSA Deployment Option 3x

Terminals supporting dual connectivity are always connected to LTE RAN, and can connect

to the NR RAN, if it is available. The eNodeB is the Master Node, and the gNodeB is the

Secondary Node. The terminals can have multiple Radio Access Bearers (RABs)

simultaneously with corresponding Data Radio Bearer (DRBs) for different services. A DRB

can be a Secondary Node terminated split DRB if the NR RAN is available, or if it is not

available, a Master Node terminated DRB.

Figure 2   NR NSA Option 3x Architecture with Dual Connectivity

If there is a split DRB, downlink traffic is split at the Packet Data Convergence

Protocol (PDCP) layer on the gNodeB. User traffic can be sent directly over the NR air

interface or can be forwarded over the X2-U to the eNodeB and then to the UE over the

LTE air interface.

In the uplink direction, user traffic can be sent over the LTE air interface or the NR

air interface. If the LTE leg is used, uplink user traffic is gathered at the PDCP layer

on the gNodeB.

The split DRB sets requirements on the transport network design for X2. Compared to LTE,

in NR NSA architecture, the X2 interface can carry a greater traffic load. If the NR DRB

quality degrades, the gNodeB sends all traffic on the LTE air interface with the

available resources.

## 3.2 NR SA

In the early introduction of the NR SA network, the NR SA network is deployed with an

existing LTE or NR NSA network for better coverage. NR SA focuses on the following

deployment scenarios:

- LTE + NR NSA + NR SA
- LTE + NR SA

While NR SA does not rely on LTE RAT, LTE is needed in the early phase of the

introduction of NR SA for the following reasons:

- LTE can complement insufficient network coverage of NR.
- Voice over NR is not supported. Voice EPS fallback is needed.

The following graphic shows the deployment scenario of LTE, NR NSA, and NR SA.

Figure 4   Deployment Scenario of LTE + NR NSA + NR SA

The N26 and the S5 interfaces are used for interworking between the 5G EPC and the

5GC.

- The LTE network consists of eNodeB\_1, eNodeB\_2, and the 5G EPC. The LTE RAN can serve all three types of UEs. The LTE UE connects to the 5G EPC by LTE RAN by default.
- The NR SA network consists of gNodeB\_1, gNodeB\_2, and the 5GC. The SA UE connects to the 5GC by the NR RAN by default.
- The NR NSA network configuration allows EN-DC connection by eNodeB\_2 and gNodeB\_1 for EN-DC capable UEs. The EN-DC capable UE connects to the 5G EPC by eNodeB\_2 and gNodeB\_1. The eNodeB\_2 is the anchor node.

The following graphic shows the deployment scenario of LTE and NR SA:

Figure 5   Deployment Scenario of LTE + NR SA

There is no X2 configured between the eNodeB and the gNodeB. The N26 and the S5

interfaces are used for interworking between the 5G EPC and the 5GC.

- The LTE network consists of eNodeB\_1, eNodeB\_2, and the EPC. The LTE RAN can serve all three types of UEs.
- The NR SA network consists of gNodeB\_1, gNodeB\_2, and the 5GC. The NR RAN can only serve SA UEs. The SA UE connects to gNodeB\_1 or gNodeB\_2 by default.

Mixed mode baseband can run both NR and LTE RATs in one baseband node simultaneouslyi in

an NR SA deployment, thereby reducing the footprint. The gNodeB function could be NR

SA-only or NR SA+NSA coexistence.

For detailed information on NR SA and mixed mode guidelines, refer to the following

documents:

- NR SA Connectivity Guidelines with Option 2, 339/221 12-IPM 101 41/100
- Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide, 138/1553-LZA 701 6014/1

- NR Indoor and Venue Solution Configuration Guideline and Examples

## 3.3 Managed Object Model (MOM)

The Managed Object Model (MOM) defines the information model with regard to node

management. It presents a view of all the manageable resources in the node, and all the

parameters and actions associated with these resources.  The MOM is defined as a set of

classes, containing attributes representing the configuration, and actions representing

the operations that can be invoked by the user.

For information on configuring Managed Objects (MOs), refer to the following

documents:

- Managed Object Model (MOM) Structure (Radio Dot System), 30/1553-FGB 101 0308/1
- Managed Object Model Description, 28/1551-AOM 901 110

# 4 Network Impact of Radio Dot NR

Radio Dot System NR feature (FAJ 121 5022) offers an enhanced mobile broadband experience

with high user data rate.

NR NSA

It introduces support for E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) with the gNodeB being the

Secondary Node in the EN-DC deployment.  The eNodeB and the gNodeB are connected through

an X2 interface. EN-DC-compliant UEs are required that can connect to both the eNodeB

and the gNodeB. UEs that are not configured with EN-DC, can only connect to the eNodeB.

With the feature activated, terminals supporting dual connectivity are always connected

to LTE RAN, and can connect to the NR RAN, if it is available.

The NR leg is used when the quality is optimal, based on the connection quality that can

be set with system configuration. In case the NR quality is below the set value, the LTE

leg is used.

The benefits of the EN-DC deployment are the following:

- Higher peak rate of network data traffic
- Traffic through eNodeB provides stability, while the gNodeB can boost traffic speed.
- Higher capacity and more scalability.
- Re-use of existing RDS architecture

NR SA

This feature requires a 5G Core network.

This feature requires an NR SA-compliant UE.

In the early introduction of the NR SA network, the NR SA network is deployed with an

existing LTE or NR NSA network for better coverage. NR SA focuses on the following

deployment scenarios:

- LTE + NR NSA + NR SA
- LTE + NR SA

While NR SA does not rely on LTE RAT, LTE is needed in the early phase of the

introduction of NR SA for the following reasons:

- LTE can complement insufficient network coverage of NR.
- Voice over NR is not supported. Voice EPS fallback is needed.
- For information on the network impacts related to NR SA, refer to the following document: Network Impact Report NR, 1/109 48-LZA 701 6017/1

# 5 Operation and Maintenance Radio Dot System NR

The gNodeB is managed in the same way and with the same interfaces and applications as

Baseband Radio Nodes: ENM is the unified network manager that supports RAN, Transport,

and Core.

- ENM
- ENM NBI
- EM tools: EMCLI EMGUI AMOS

NR  NSA and ENM

The NR NSA deployment is supported with ENM 19.1 and later.

It is recommended to manage the eNodeB and gNodeB in an NR NSA System using the same ENM

instance to have a single OAM platform from which to view the network.

A separate ENM instance for NR is also supported. For the separate ENM instance, use ENM

19.2 or higher.

NR  SA and ENM

The NR SA deployment is supported with ENM 20.3 and later.

## 5.1 Configuration Management

ENM CM tools provide the same support for gNodeB as for Baseband Radio Node. The eNodeB

and the gNodeB are configured separately, but the CM notifications are sent the same

way.

## 5.2 Fault Management

In EN-DC, eNodeB and gNodeB have different alarm handling procedures. ENM monitors the

different MEs separately.

The same ENM alarm handling tools are available for both eNodeB and for gNodeB, for

example, Alarm Monitor or FM CLI. For gNodeB, EMCLI and EMGUI are available both on-site

and from ENM.

Primary and secondary alarm correlation is only possible among components within eNodeB

or gNodeB. Alarm correlation is not possible between eNodeB and gNodeB.

If an X2 connection cannot be set up between an eNodeB and a gNodeB, an alarm is raised.

If an X2 link is broken, link recovery actions take place. If the recovery actions are

not successful, an alarm is raised.

## 5.3 Performance Management

ENM performance management tools, including the ENIQ Statistics Integration, support the

gNodeB and the Baseband Radio Node in the same way.

In EN-DC, the control plane traffic is processed by the eNodeB. PM counters of the eNodeB

remain unaffected. The eNodeB counters are reported in a file every 15 minutes and are

used to construct KPIs. The eNodeB events are collected every 15 minutes and are stored

in closed files. With NR, new counters and events are added to the Baseband Radio

Node.

In EN-DC, the user plane traffic is processed by both the eNodeB and the gNodeB. The

counters of the nodes are reported in a file every 15 minutes and are used to construct

KPIs. The events of the nodes are collected every 5 minutes while the counters are

collected every 15 minutes. The collected events and counters are stored in closed

files. The same transport counters are used in both the Baseband Radio Node and the 5G

Radio Node. For NR, new counters and events are added to the Baseband Radio Node.

## 5.4 License Management

Licenses and HWACs work the same way in the gNodeB as in the eNodeB.

Each node requires a separate LKF.

For detailed information on feature licenses, refer to Software Packages and Feature Licenses.
