# 1 Priority-Controlled Scheduling Overview

The feature enables scheduling priority configuration on a QCI and 5QI

basis.

| Feature Name           | Priority-Controlled Scheduling                                             |

| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                                                            |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

Different services and subscriber groups have varying requirements for QoS prioritization to

achieve a good performance. This feature introduces support for the configuration of

scheduling priority differentiation on bearer level based on the priority levels of

the QCI and the 5QI. The different priorities in the gNodeB are absolute.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- The operator can prioritize between different users based on their subscriptions.
- The operator can prioritize between different DRBs of a user.
- A greater number of users are satisfied because services with higher priority requirements are served appropriately.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Because of a limitation in the observability framework, QoS KPIs, counters, and

events can only peg correctly for the following QCIs and 5QIs:

- 1-9
- 65-66
- 67
- 69-70
- 79-86
- 128-137

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- The AMF and SMF must have QoS enforcement implemented.
- The EPC must include the QCI, mandatory on S1-AP, forwarded by the eNodeB over X2, which fulfills the requirements.
- ENM version 20.3 or later is required for this feature.

System Functions

The feature depends on QoS separation from other nodes:

- QCI separation over X2AP
- 5QI separation over NGAP with or without explicit priority level from 5GC.

# 3 Feature Operation of Priority-Controlled Scheduling

The feature supports allocating and distinguishing priority on the bearer level for each

UE on a QCI and 5QI basis.

The feature enables the operator to make a distinct scheduling priority between different

types of bearers. This means that a higher priority bearer gets access to resources

before lower priority bearers. This provides operators with a more granular control of

the QoS priority on a bearer level for each UE by the gNodeB scheduler.

The functionality includes the following:

- The mapping of 5QI priority level to the gNodeB scheduling priority. This can be differentiated based on slice.
- The mapping of EN-DC users based on QCI.

From Priority Level to Priority Domain

Figure 1   From Priority Level to Priority Domain

The gNodeB retrieves the 3GPP priority level based on the following:

- 5QI, PLMN and S-NSSAI received on NGAP for SA solution
- 5QI, PLMN and S-NSSAI received on XnAP for NR-DC solution
- QCI PLMN, and SPID received on X2AP for EN-DC solution

The gNodeB maps QCI y to 5QI y. The explicit priority level is read from the

configuration. The priority level is used to find the internal priority of the

gNodeB represented by the priority domain, as shown in Figure 2. Mapping from priority level to

priority domain is performed based on configuration. All priority levels not

explicitly mapped to a priority are mapped to the default priority domain, which is

48.

Figure 2   Priority Domain Mapping Example

Scheduling Weights and Priority Domains

Priorities are represented by scheduling weights in the RAN. The higher the weight,

the higher the priority is. This scheduling weight is calculated by using a

scheduling algorithm, which is a function of the QoS requirements and the time since

the last scheduling occurred.

The scheduling weights are divided into different priority domains. Each priority

domain is separated from the others. The priority domains implement absolute

priority between users and DRBs. The chosen priority domain is a function of the 5QI

and the priority level.

Absolute Priority Scheduling for EN-DC

The feature introduces updated uplink and downlink retransmission priority to avoid

an uplink biased access to the PDCCH resources compared to downlink. This can change

the distribution between the allocated downlink to uplink scheduling elements for

every TTI. Downlink retransmission performance can improve in overloaded

scenarios.

## 3.1 UE Grouping for Priority Scheduling

The UE Grouping for Priority Scheduling function enables the modification of QoS

parameters for a UE group created through the UE Grouping Framework.

The DUQosModifier MO can be created manually.

Instances of the following MOs can be created manually:

- DUModified5qi
- DUModified5qiUeCfg

The instances of the DUModified5qiUeCfg MO are differentiated by the

following MO attributes:

- DUModified5qiUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueConfGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueGroupList

If either of the attributes in the DUModified5qiUeCfg MO is

empty, the original value is not modified.

# 4 Network Impact of Priority-Controlled Scheduling

The feature can impact performance depending on the configuration of specific

bearers.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enables more precise priority configuration for DRBs, which can optimize

performance. If specific bearers are configured to have higher priority than the

others, then these higher priority bearers always access the available resources

before the lower priority bearers.

This feature may cause starvation of other connections.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following MOs can be created manually:

- DUQosModifier

Instances of the following MOs can be created manually:

- DUModified5qi
- DUModified5qiUeCfg

The instances of MO DUModified5qiUeCfg are differentiated by the

following MO attributes:

- prefUeGroupList
- ueGroupList

If either of the attributes in the DUModified5qiUeCfg MO is

empty, the original value is not modified.
