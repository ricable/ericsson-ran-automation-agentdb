Hardware

For information on IDLe and TN port connectivity requirements, see Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the feature:

- A maximum number of 96 external SCells are supported in each capacity module. If the maximum number of external SCells is exceeded, the NRCellRelation.caStatusInfo attribute value changes to E5\_CELL\_ALLOC\_CAP.
- Each capacity module can have up to six client and six server E5 tunnels at the same time. The E5U Link to GNBDU Failure alarm is raised with the E5 resources are exhausted. additional text if the maximum number of E5 tunnels is exceeded.
- If the RTT delay over the E5 interface is larger than the requirement, fewer component carriers or no carrier aggregation can be configured.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

E5 Link RTT Requirements for Carrier Aggregation

# 3 Feature Operation of Advanced RAN Coordination

This feature enables inter-Baseband coordination between gNodeB-DUs through the NR E5

Ethernet interface.

Operational Process for Inter-Baseband Configurations

For inter-Baseband (inter-gNodeB-DU) configuration, two levels of Communication Link

are available:

| High   |    | E5H   |
|--------|----|-------|
|        |    |       |
| Low    |    | E5L   |

The configuration of the E5L interconnection is managed with the E5H level on an NR

node-to-node basis.

The E5H interface provides the signaling between related cell entities in separate

gNodeB-DU entities.

The E5H relies on the EAB E5 transport services provided at the F1-C and the Xn-C

interfaces to transport of the E5H PDUs between the gNodeB-DU endpoints. See Figure 1.

Figure 1   Operation of Advanced RAN Coordination for NR Carrier Aggregation for

Inter-Baseband Configurations

The E5L protocol is used to interconnect a range of Baseband applications within the

NR RAN. The Baseband applications are distributed among a set of gNodeB-DU

entities.

The gNodeB that hosts the PCell and the gNodeB that hosts the ESCell are connected

through the E5L links over IDLe or TN ports. See Figure 2.

Control plane data is transmitted over the E5L link between gNodeB-DUs. The UE

connects to the SpCell. The ESCell is configured and activated according to the same

criteria as for a local SCell. The user plane data is sent to the ESCell through the

E5 tunnel.

Figure 2   IDLe Port Configuration with VLAN Switch

## 3.1 E5 Link Handling for Carrier Aggregation

This feature provides E5 link management through the introduced MO

classes.

On the master gNodeB-DU, the system or the operator creates the

ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO.

The system automatically creates  the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO when

a carrier aggregation neighbor relation is detected. If the operator wants to use a

different VLAN port configuration for carrier aggregation than the default, the operator

can create this MO and set the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction.caVlanPortRef

attribute.

The establishment of the E5 link towards the partner gNodeB-DU is triggered when the

value of the ExternalNRCellCU.serviceState attribute becomes

IN\_SERVICE for a carrier aggregation candidate cell.

On the partner gNodeB-DU, the system automatically creates the

ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO during the establishment of the E5

link.

When the E5 link is established, an instance of the InterMeLink MO is

created under the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO instance by the system.

The E5 tunnel and theInterMeLink MO are maintained until there is at

least one neighbor carrier aggregation candidate cell with service state IN\_SERVICE

towards the partner gNodeB-DU.

When the ExternalNRCellCU.serviceState attribute becomes

OUT\_OF\_SERVICE on all neighbor cells towards the partner gNodeB-DU,

the E5 tunnel is removed. After this, the system removes theInterMeLink MO and the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO

instances on the partner gNodeB. The ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO

towards the partner gNodeB-DU is removed on the master gNodeB when the

InterMeLink MO is removed. If the

ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO is operator-created, it cannot be

removed by the system.

## 3.2 E5 Link RTT Requirements for Carrier Aggregation

If the RTT delay from an Advanced RAN Coordination partner is larger than the maximum

supported value, SCells on that partner are not considered for carrier

aggregation.

RTT delay requirements differ for downlink and uplink carrier aggregation.

Table 1   Maximum RTT Delay Supported Over the E5 Interface for Downlink Carrier

Aggregation

|            | 2CC         | 3CC    | 4CC    | 5CC    | 6CC    |
|------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| FDD SpCell | 900 μs      | 900 μs | 900 μs | 900 μs | 900 μs |
| TDD SpCell | 900 μs  (1) | 350 μs | 350 μs | 350 μs | 350 μs |

(1)

For better downlink carrier aggregation performance, it is

recommended to have an E5 link RTT of less than 350 μs.

In downlink and uplink carrier aggregation, the partner gNodeBs and capacity modules

are connected by the same E5 link through the Advanced RAN Coordination feature. For

uplink carrier aggregation, the RTT delay requirement is calculated as

follows:

Table 2   Maximum RTT Delay Supported over the E5 Interface When the Uplink Carrier

Aggregation Feature Is Enabled

|            | 2CC                              | 3CC                           | 4CC                           | 5CC                           | 6CC                           |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| FDD SpCell | MIN (900 μs; 500 μs) = 500 μs    | MIN (900 μs; 500 μs) = 500 μs | MIN (900 μs; 500 μs) = 500 μs | MIN (900 μs; 500 μs) = 500 μs | MIN (900 μs; 500 μs) = 500 μs |
| TDD SpCell | MIN (900 μs; 500 μs) = 500 μs(2) | MIN (350 μs; 500 μs) = 350 μs | MIN (350 μs; 500 μs) = 350 μs | MIN (350 μs; 500 μs) = 350 μs | MIN (350 μs; 500 μs) = 350 μs |

(2)

For better downlink carrier aggregation performance, it

is recommended to have an E5 link RTT of less than 350

μs.

## 3.3 Software Interoperability over the E5 Interface

The feature supports interoperability between nodes running on different software

versions. Before the E5 tunnel is set up, the client and server nodes exchange information

about the software versions and capabilities they support. Based on this, the nodes decide

whether they can interoperate.

By allowing collaborating gNodeBs of different software versions to temporarily coexist

in the network, the feature provides a time window to perform the necessary upgrades,

while the basic carrier aggregation functions between the collaborating gNodeBs are

maintained.

Until all the gNodeBs are upgraded to the same version, enhancements of carrier

aggregation added in later software releases might not work as expected, or some level

of carrier aggregation service degradation might occur. For this reason, the time window

for upgrades provided by the feature is only a temporary state. Operators are expected

to upgrade the whole network to the same software release.

There is no general guideline on how long interoperability is supported between the nodes

in such a network. However, if software compatibility between releases cannot be

maintained, the information is included in Compliance and Compatibility before the

compatibility is discontinued.

The following alarms can be raised to highlight when differences in software versions

might cause some level of carrier aggregation service degradation:

- Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Degraded
- Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable

Figure 3   Alarm Use Cases

If the inter-node carrier aggregation service becomes unavailable, the

NRCellRelation.caStatusInfo attribute is updated to a value that

indicates the cause.

The UEs that use external SCells consume the same number of resources as the UEs that

use internal cells on the gNodeB.

Interfaces

For gNodeB-DUs located on different Baseband units, the feature introduces the

proprietary NR E5 interface for cooperation and communication between Advanced RAN

Coordination partners - separate gNodeB-DUs. The E5 interface uses

the XnAP and F1AP interfaces as transport layer for connectivity on Layer 3. The

XnAP and F1AP interfaces are updated with containers used for NR cell information,

E5 link configuration, and E5 tunnel setup. For the establishment of the XnAP

interface, transport network connectivity is necessary over IDLe or TN ports between

partner nodes. The E5 tunnel, E5L connection established on Layer 2, is based on

Ethernet connection.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Advanced RAN Coordination

# 6 Performance of Advanced RAN Coordination

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, and events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Advanced RAN Coordination

This is a non-license-controlled feature. It does not require manual activation and

cannot be deactivated.

A license key exists in the LKF but it has no impact and is planned to be removed. If

featureState is ACTIVATED in the

FeatureState=CXC4012519 MO instance when the license key is

removed, the License Key Not Availablealarm is triggered.

To avoid this, it is recommended to keep the featureState

DEACTIVATED.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Advanced RAN Coordination

## 8.1 Configure Advanced RAN Coordination for NR DL Carrier Aggregation

This feature requires manual setup for inter-Baseband configuration.

Prerequisites

- For inter-Baseband configurations, the Xn connection must be established between the partner gNodeBs. For more information, see Xn Configuration.

Steps

1. Create a TnPort MO instance under the Equipment MO instance on the IDLe or TN port that is used to connect to the partner gNodeB.
2. Under the Transport MO instance, create an EthernetPort MO instance that refers to the TnPort MO instance.
3. Under the Transport MO instance, create a VlanPort MO instance that refers to the EthernetPort MO instance.
4. Configure the VlanPort.vlanId attribute with the correct VLAN ID intended for carrier aggregation.

If more VLAN IDs are used for different purposes, a VlanPort

MO instance must be created for each VLAN ID to be used. Partner nodes must be

connected to the same VLAN with the IDLe or TN port.

5. Set the GNBDUFunction.caVlanPortRef attribute to reference the VlanPort MO created in step 3.
6. Optional: Set the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction.caVlanPortRef attribute on the neighbor gNodeB to reference the VlanPort MO created for carrier aggregation. The associated ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction.caVlanPortRef attribute supports that VLAN ID for connectivity.
7. Optional: Set the GNBDUFunction.pimVlanPortRef MO instance under the attribute to reference the VlanPort MO created for PIM avoidance. The GNBDUFunction.pimVlanPortRef attribute is used when there is no value set for the ExtENodeBPartnerFunction.pimVlanPortRef attribute.
8. Create the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO on the gNodeB that hosts the SpCell.
9. Create the NRCellRelation MO.
10. Set the NRCellRelation.nRCellRef attribute to reference the ExternalNRCellCU MO that represents the cell located on the partner gNodeB.
11. Set the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL.

## 8.2 Coexistence of Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination

In an LTE + NR Mixed Mode Baseband unit, the Elastic RAN and

the NR Advanced RAN Coordination features can coexist.

Inter-Baseband Configuration

It is recommended to use separate IDLe links for Elastic RAN carrier aggregation and

E5 traffic used for NR downlink carrier aggregation. Using separate IDLe links

provides separate IDLe link capacity, signaling, and data transfer speeds for LTE

carrier aggregation and NR carrier aggregation traffic.

A single IDLe port on a Baseband unit can support two

10GE links.

For more information on the IDLe port capabilities of

different Baseband units, see the specific Baseband Description.

A minimum of 10 Gbps IDLe link capacity is recommended

for E5 traffic used for NR downlink carrier aggregation.

For more information on IDLe or TN connectivity principles and guidelines, see Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline.

# 9 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 9.1 21.Q2: Support of Six Partner Baseband Units and 54 External SCells for Advanced RAN Coordination

This feature enhancement allows the use of six partner Baseband units and 54 external

SCells for each gNodeB in Advanced RAN Coordination.

| Feature Name:           | Advanced                             RAN Coordination   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5271                                            |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                                         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type:            | NR                                                      |

Benefits

The feature enhancement enables a more flexible downlink carrier aggregation partner

selection for UEs. This is achieved by supporting up to six partner Baseband units

and 54 external SCells for each gNodeB in Advanced RAN Coordination.

Capacity and Performance

The more optimal selection of partner Baseband units and external SCells for Advanced

RAN coordination enables better performance.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 9.2 22.Q1: Software Upgrade Support through Advanced RAN Coordination

This feature enhancement makes node software upgrade easier by temporarily allowing

gNodeBs with different software versions to coexist in the network.

| Feature Name:           | Advanced RAN Coordination   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5271                |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node         |
| Access Type:            | NR                          |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement gives more flexibility during node software update, because

the enhancement allows collaborating gNodeBs of different software versions to

coexist in the network. The enhancement provides a time window for operators to

perform the necessary upgrades, while the basic carrier aggregation functions

between the collaborating gNodeBs are maintained. All the gNodeBs must be upgraded

to the same version to make the enhancements of carrier aggregation in later

software releases fully functional.

Alarms are introduced together with this enhancement to highlight when differences in

software versions might cause some level of carrier aggregation service degradation.

For this reason, the time window for upgrades provided by this enhancement is only a

transitory state. Operators are expected to upgrade the whole network to the same

software release.

There is no general guideline how long interoperability is supported between the

nodes in such a network. However, if software compatibility between releases cannot

be maintained, the information is included in the Release Notes before

the compatibility is discontinued.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement relies on inter-node communication through the E5 interface.

Before the E5 tunnel is set up, the client and server nodes exchange information

about the software versions and capabilities they support. Based on this, the nodes

decide whether they can collaborate.

The following alarms are introduced by this feature enhancement:

- Inter-Node Carrier Aggregation Service Degraded
- Inter-Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable

These alarms are raised when the differences between the software versions or

node capabilities might affect inter-node carrier aggregation.

The existing NRCellRelation.caStatusInfo attribute can be used

with the alarms. The following values are added to this attribute to indicate the

reason if carrier aggregation service becomes unavailable:

- E5\_MAND\_CAP\_MISMATCH
- E5\_SW\_VERSION\_MISMATCH

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

The E5 interface is updated to support this feature enhancement.
