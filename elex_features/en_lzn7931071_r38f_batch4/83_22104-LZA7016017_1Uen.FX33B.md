Summary

This feature enables the use of advanced beamforming in good to medium channel conditions.

This can provide better downlink throughput and capacity compared to codebook-based

transmission for UEs that support SRS. The SRS transmitted by the UE is the basis

for channel estimation that can be used to determine the beamforming weights of

downlink transmission.

# 2 Dependencies of Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

The feature only supports NR Mid-Band TDD AAS radios with eCPRI and 16, 32, or 64

antennas. The benefits of the feature depend on the channel conditions and the SRS

capabilities of the UE.

For more information, see Interaction between the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature and the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band Feature.

Hardware

The feature requires NR Mid-Band AAS radios with eCPRI and 16, 32, or 64 antennas and

the same Baseband units as the Massive MIMO Mid-Band feature. For more information,

see Radio Node Configurations.

The speed-based beamforming mode switching function is supported on RAN Compute group

5 and higher.

Setting the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute to

true and configuring the

NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute are only

supported on RAN Compute group 5 and higher.

Limitations

If the AAS radio supports more than one carrier through a single eCPRI link, the

feature can be enabled in up to two carriers with a total maximum bandwidth of 90

MHz.

Network Requirements

UEs capable of SRS transmission benefit from this feature.

The UE sends SRS if the SRS-ResourceSet.usage RRC parameter is set

to the antennaSwitching value.

If the cell is configured for aperiodic SRS, only UEs that are capable of aperiodic

SRS transmission can benefit from aperiodic SRS.

Interaction between the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

Feature and the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band Feature

For the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature to operate

correctly with the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band feature, CSI-RS needs

to be configured for 32 ports. Otherwise, either the NR Directional Control for EMF

Power Lock Mid-Band feature or the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

feature must be disabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

The feature takes advantage of the reciprocity of the TDD transmission, which means

that in a TDD cell, the same frequency is used for downlink and uplink

transmission.

The gNodeB uses the Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) transmitted by the UEs for downlink

channel estimation, which is used for beamforming in the PDSCH. Beams based on SRS are

more precise than the beams based on codebook type 1.

The feature only operates in the PCell in NR standalone deployment or in the SpCell in

EN-DC deployments. The feature uses aperiodic or periodic SRS to determine the

beamforming weights of downlink transmissions. If the

NRCellDU.aperiodicSrsEnabled attribute is set to

ON, the gNodeB uses aperiodic SRS and codebook-based

transmission.

All cells in the gNodeB-DU must have the same setting.

The gNodeB allocates SRS resources to the UE if the following conditions apply:

- The channel quality is good to medium.
- The UE is capable of SRS transmission.
- Optionally, the gNodeB can switch between beamforming modes based on configurable thresholds in the following cases: The UE is considered to have heavy traffic. The estimated effective speed of the UE is below the threshold.

After the UE starts to send SRS to the gNodeB, these uplink signals are used for downlink

channel estimation. As a result, downlink beamforming can be adapted to the specific

needs of the UE.

The increase in throughput depends on the capability of the UE and the channel

conditions.

The feature switches between codebook-based and reciprocity-based transmission for UEs

that are configured with SRS based on channel quality measurements, SRS port validity

checks, and other factors.

If the channel quality deteriorates below a predefined threshold, the gNodeB switches to

codebook-based transmission and the periodic SRS resources are released. These resources

can be reallocated to another UE in better channel conditions.

When the value of the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute

is set to true, codebook-based transmission is used if at least one SRS

port is not considered usable by the gNodeB. The cells in the gNodeB-DU can have

different values for the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable

attribute.

For more information about SRS, see Sounding Reference

Signal.

Periodic SRS Operational Process

As SRS resources are limited, SRS resource allocation is prioritized for

heavy-traffic UEs. UEs are considered heavy traffic if their session data size and

packet age exceed preconfigured thresholds. The threshold for UE session data size

is defined by the NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr attribute, and the

threshold for UE session packet age is defined by the

NRCellDU.nrSrsDlPacketAgeThr attribute.

Figure 1   SRS Reconfiguration

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The UE reports that it supports periodic SRS transmission.
3. The UE is configured for codebook-based transmission by default.
4. The UE session is evaluated if the NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr attribute is set to a non-zero value. The UE session is labeled heavy traffic if the following conditions apply: If the NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr attribute is set to 0, no UE sessions are labeled heavy traffic, and SRS resources are allocated in the order of the arrival of the UEs.
    1. The UE session data size exceeds the threshold defined by the NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr attribute.
    2. If the NRCellDU.nrSrsDlPacketAgeThr attribute is set to a non-zero value, then the packet age of the UE session is considered as well.
5. The gNodeB checks the channel quality based on uplink measurements.
6. The UE-estimated effective speed is evaluated. The UE can be granted SRS resources for periodic SRS if its estimated effective speed is below the threshold. For SU-MIMO, the threshold is set with the NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh attribute.
7. If channel quality is determined to be good enough, the UE is configured for SRS with RRC reconfiguration.
8. The UE starts to transmit SRS periodically. Channel quality is continuously monitored based on SRS. If the quality of the SRS sent by the UE degrades under a predefined threshold, the gNodeB reconfigures the UE to release the SRS resources. The SRS resources are also released if the estimated effective speed of the UE exceeds the threshold or thresholds.
9. If the value of the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute is set to true and any SRS ports are not considered usable, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming weights. This check is performed in every downlink slot where the UE is scheduled.
10. In every downlink slot where the UE is scheduled, the gNodeB determines which SRS ports are valid for advanced beamforming. SRS ports are considered valid in the following cases: Their SRS SINR exceeds a predefined threshold. Their pairwise correlation is below the threshold values configured through the NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute. If the number of valid SRS ports is lower than the latest rank reported by the UE, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming weights in the downlink transmission. Otherwise, the gNodeB uses the valid SRS ports to calculate reciprocity-based beamforming weights in the downlink transmission.

As seen in Figure 1, part of the process

forms a recurring sequence. The sequence repeats itself for every downlink slot

where the UE is scheduled or every time that the gNodeB receives an SRS transmission

from the UE for the channel quality check.

Aperiodic SRS Operational Process

The feature is capable of using aperiodic SRS to determine downlink beamforming

weights. The NRCellDU.aperiodicSrsEnabled must be

ON to use aperiodic SRS.

Aperiodic SRS enables the more efficient use of resources to active downlink users

compared to periodic SRS, as the gNodeB does not need to release the SRS resources

even if the channel quality is not sufficient for advanced beamforming. The more

efficient use of SRS resources is dependent on the number of UEs capable of

aperiodic SRS transmission and traffic load in the cell.

More users can use advanced beamforming with aperiodic SRS, so overall downlink cell

throughput and SRS resource utilization can be improved in good and medium channel

conditions.

Aperiodic SRS triggering is only possible through DCI format 1\_1.

4. The gNodeB assigns the aperiodic SRS resources based on symbol, offset, comb, and cyclic shift without checking the uplink channel quality. The srs-Config IE is configured by RRC reconfiguration.

The gNodeB triggers aperiodic SRS for the UE based on the following factors: SRS SINR Valid slot offset Data in the buffer Estimated effective speed of the UE The value of the SRS request field for the aperiodic SRS request in the DCI format 1\_1 is set to 10. If the aperiodic SRS resource set is not triggered, the value of the SRS request field is set to 00.
6. If the value of the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute is set to true and any SRS ports are not considered usable, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming weights. This check is performed in every downlink slot where the UE is scheduled.
7. In every downlink slot where the UE is scheduled, the gNodeB determines which SRS ports are valid for advanced beamforming. SRS ports are considered valid in the following cases: Their SRS SINR exceeds a predefined threshold. Their pairwise correlation is below the threshold values configured through the NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute. The latest sounded ports are not older than a predefined threshold. If the number of valid SRS ports is lower than the latest rank reported by the UE, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming weights in the downlink transmissions. Otherwise, the gNodeB uses the valid SRS ports to calculate the reciprocity-based beamforming weights in the downlink transmission.

As seen in Figure 2, part of the process

forms a recurring sequence that repeats itself for every downlink slot where the UE

is scheduled.

Coexisting Aperiodic and Periodic SRS Operational Process

The following attributes must be set to TRUE to use the

coexisting aperiodic and periodic SRS function:

- GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled
- NRCellDU.advancedDlSuMimoEnabled
- NRCellDU.aperiodicSrsEnabled

All cells in the gNodeB-DU must have the same setting.

When the

function is enabled, aperiodic and periodic SRS can be configured in the same

cell and on the same gNode-DU

Otherwise, the gNodeB assigns the aperiodic SRS resources based on symbol, offset, comb, and cyclic shift without checking the uplink channel quality. The srs-Config IE is configured by RRC reconfiguration.
5. The gNodeB triggers aperiodic SRS for the UE based on the following factors: SRS SINR Valid slot offset Data in the buffer Estimated effective speed of the UE The value of the SRS request field for the aperiodic SRS request in the DCI format 1\_1 is set to 10. If the aperiodic SRS resource set is not triggered, the value of the SRS request field is set to 00.
6. If the value of the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute is set to true and any SRS ports are not considered usable, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming weights. This check is performed in every downlink slot where the UE is scheduled.
7. In every downlink slot where the UE is scheduled, the gNodeB determines which SRS ports are valid for advanced beamforming. SRS ports are considered valid in the following cases: Their SRS SINR exceeds a predefined threshold. Their pairwise correlation is below the threshold values configured through the NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute. For aperiodic SRS, the latest sounded ports are not older than a predefined threshold. If the number of valid SRS ports is lower than the latest rank reported by the UE, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming weights in the downlink transmissions. Otherwise, the gNodeB uses the valid SRS ports to calculate the reciprocity-based beamforming weights in the downlink transmission.

As seen in Figure 3, part of the process

forms a recurring sequence. The sequence repeats itself for every downlink slot

where the UE is scheduled or every time that the gNodeB receives an SRS transmission

from the UE for the channel quality check.

## 3.1 Sounding Reference Signal

The Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band and the Advanced Downlink Multi-User

MIMO Mid-Band features both use SRS. With the help of SRS, the gNodeB can estimate the

downlink channel between the UE and the gNodeB, which is used for beamforming in the

PDSCH.

The following characteristics apply to both periodic and aperiodic SRS:

- SRS is configured with the use of antenna switching.
- On RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units in RAN Compute group 5 and higher, up to 16 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.
- On other RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units, up to 8 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.
- The SRS power, that is the p0 nominal value, is configured with the NRCellDU.pZeroNomSrs attribute.
- Since SRSs are scheduled in unused uplink symbols in special slots, resources are not taken from PUSCH data. Because of this, the SRS does not cause any extra overhead for PUSCH.

Periodic SRS

For periodic SRS, a UE can be configured with a RRCReconfiguration

message to periodically transmit the SRS in the uplink over the configured

bandwidth.

The following characteristics apply to the periodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- A full-band SRS resource spans one uplink OFDM symbol in a special slot.
- A half-band SRS resource spans two uplink OFDM symbols in a special slot.
- Periodicity is with 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 slots. The default periodicity is 40 slots.
- SRS periodicity can be controlled through the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute. This attribute can be used to balance the number of UEs configured for SRS against the throughput gain for each UE.

Offsets

Aperiodic SRS

For aperiodic SRS, the gNodeB triggers a UE to transmit aperiodic SRS on demand

through DCI format 1\_1. The UE is triggered to transmit SRS aperiodically depending

on the demand in terms of UE traffic.

The following characteristics apply to the aperiodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- Four uplink symbols need to be configured in the special subframe.
- The first and third symbol for uplink in the special slot can be configured for aperiodic SRS.
- The ports configured in the uplink symbols for carrying SRS are dynamically shared among the active aperiodic SRS users.
- Half-band SRS is not supported for aperiodic SRS.

on the demand in terms of UE traffic.

The following characteristics apply to both periodic and aperiodic SRS used for

advanced beamforming:

- A full-band SRS resource spans one or two uplink OFDM symbols in the special slot.
- Four uplink symbols need to be configured in the special subframe.
- The first and third symbol for uplink in the special slot can be configured for both periodic and aperiodic SRS.
- The comb resources are split between periodic and aperiodic SRS users.
- The ports configured in the uplink symbols for carrying SRS are dynamically shared among the active aperiodic SRS users.
- Half-band SRS is not supported when the GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled attribute is enabled.

## 3.2 Deployment Scenarios of Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

The benefits of the feature are most observable in sites with the following

characteristics:

- Sites where UE mobility is limited.Note: Compared to codebook-based beamforming, advanced beamforming is in general more sensitive to the UE speed due to the aging channel estimates.
- Sites where the inter-site distances are close.

## 3.3 Speed-Based Beamforming Mode Selection

The gNodeB can use the estimated effective speed of UEs to select the optimal

beamforming mode for each UE to maximize downlink cell throughput.

Codebook-based beamforming is more suitable for UEs that move, as UE location cannot be

updated fast enough for narrow beams to track it. Advanced beamforming can provide

increased downlink throughput for stationary or slowly moving UEs.

The gNodeB calculates the estimated effective speed for each UE. The following conditions

are considered when the estimated effective speed is calculated:

- The Doppler effect
- Channel variation
- UE transmission impairment
- UE interference

Based on the estimated effective speed, the following operations can be performed:

- Beamforming mode switch
- Periodic SRS configuration and release
- Aperiodic SRS trigger

The beamforming mode switch that is based on the estimated effective speed might improve

the following aspects of the feature:

- SRS resource utilization
- Downlink UE throughput for moving UEs

The most suitable beamforming mode is selected for each UE

based

on the NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh attribute and the

NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh attribute.

For the beamforming mode switch, hysteresis is taken into account. This means that the

beamforming mode switch does not occur as soon as the estimated effective speed of the

UE exceeds or drops below a threshold. This way, constant beamforming mode switching can

be avoided that might be otherwise triggered due to estimation noise.

# 4 Network Impact of Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

The feature improves downlink throughput with advanced beamforming.

Capacity and Performance

The average downlink throughput of the cell improves. As a result, spectral

efficiency and capacity are also improved. The benefit depends on the capability of

the UE, the channel conditions, and the number of SRS-capable UEs present in the

cell at the same time.

Heavy-traffic UEs have a higher chance of being allocated SRS resources first. In

cells with high traffic volume, favoring heavy-traffic UEs results in SRS resources

being used more efficiently, which further increases spectral efficiency.

The gNodeB considers the number of valid SRS ports that UEs have and uses

reciprocity-based beamforming based on these assessments, which might improve

downlink performance in the following ways:

- The cell throughput might increase.
- The throughput of UEs with reciprocity-based transmission might increase.
- The BLER of UEs with reciprocity-based transmission might decrease.

Interfaces

SRS resources are configured for UEs capable of SRS in good to medium channel

conditions with an RRCReconfiguration message.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

| NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth          | Introduced | See MOM description.  This attribute allows the configuration of full-band or             half-band SRS. If the attribute is set to HALF, half-band SRS is used,             which allows the UE to transmit SRS with increased coverage. Full-band SRS uses one             uplink OFDM symbol in a special slot, while half-band SRS uses two. The SRS capacity of             the cell is the same with both the half-band and the fullband configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity               | Introduced | See MOM description.  The value of the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute                                 must be set to a value based on the selected TDD pattern and the                                 antenna switching capability. The value needs to be high enough that                                 enough slots are available to transmit SRS. For example, UEs with                                 1TX/4RX capability and a DDDSUUDDDD TDD pattern require that the                                     NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute is set to                                 at least 40 to transmit SRS from all antennas. |

Counters

The feature introduces the following counters related to scheduling:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoTxRankDistr

The feature introduces the following counters related to the use of SRS:

- NRCellDU.pmMacActiveSrsUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlRat
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschCbRatDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacSrsPdschAgeDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResAvailAntSwitchingThe SRS resources available in each cell are calculated based on the number of available SRS ports for each symbol carrying SRS. On RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units in RAN Compute group 5, 16 SRS ports are available in the SRS symbols. On other RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units, eight SRS ports are available in the SRS symbols.
- NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResUsedAntSwitching

The value of the NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResUsedAntSwitching counter

reflects the number of SRS resources allocated to UEs in a cell. These SRS resources

can vary depending on the site configuration and the number of cells connected to

the Baseband unit where this feature enabled.

When the half-band SRS configuration is enabled in the cell, that is the

NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth attribute is set to

HALF, the values of the

NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResAvailAntSwitching and the

NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResUsedAntSwitching PM counters double

compared to the fullband SRS configuration. This increase occurs because two uplink

OFDM symbols are available in the special slot with the half-band configuration.

However, the SRS utilization does not double since the half-band SRS configuration

does not increase the SRS capacity in the cell.

The feature introduces the NRCellDU.pmUeEffDopplerSpeedDistr

counter to observe the distribution of UEs based on estimated effective speed.

If the NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute is set to

true, the

NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr PM counter

can be used to observe the shift in the number of advanced layers.

Events

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

## 9.1 Attribute Configurations for SRS Configuration and Precoder Selection

Switching between codebook-based and reciprocity-based transmissions for UEs is

configurable through attribute settings in the gNodeB on a cell level.

The gNodeB switches between codebook-based and reciprocity-based beamforming based on the

following checks:

- SRS port validity checks
- UE-estimated effective speed

SRS Configuration

The following attributes can be used to configure aperiodic SRS or coexisting

aperiodic and periodic SRS-capable UEs on a cell level:

- NRCellDU.aperiodicSrsEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled

The NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth attribute can be used to switch

between full-band and half-band SRS. The half-band SRS setting allows the UE to

transmit SRS with increased coverage. Full-band SRS uses one uplink OFDM symbol in a

special slot, while half-band SRS uses two.

The following attributes can be used to allocate periodic SRS resources to UEs with

heavy downlink traffic:

- NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr
- NRCellDU.nrSrsDlPacketAgeThr

The NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh attribute can be used to configure

the effective speed limit for the configuration of SRS.

Precoder Selection

The UE-estimated effective speed threshold values can be configured through the

NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh and the

NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh attributes. Depending on the

UE-estimated effective speed, the gNodeB configures beamforming in the following

way:

Table 6   Beamforming Configuration Depending on UE-Estimated Effective

Speed

| Higher                                                                                                                                                                 | Higher                                                                                                                                                                 | Codebook-based beamforming            |

The following attributes can be used to configure precoder selection through the

configuration of SRS port validity checks:

- NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable
- NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh

The NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable can be configured to

check if the SRS ports of the UE are all usable for reciprocity-based beamforming.

If any SRS ports are not valid, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming

weights.

The NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute can be used to

set the two different threshold values to be compared with the correlation values of

the channel estimations from SRS transmissions. This allows the gNodeB to determine

the number of valid SRS ports that can be used for reciprocity-based beamforming by

checking the correlation thresholds for the different number of SRS ports.

The first threshold value is applicable to UEs that have two valid SRS ports, where

the antenna deployment might lead to highly correlated channel information from the

two SRS ports. The first threshold value must be set to a lower number than the

second threshold. The second threshold value is applicable to any UE. The value is

used to prevent cases where the UE transmits SRS from the different SRS resources of

the UE from the same physical antenna.

The NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable and the

NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attributes do not

interact with each other.

Advanced Downlink MUlti-User MIMO Mid-Band

## Appendix A.d: 22.Q2: Enhanced SRS Resource Allocation

This feature enhancement increases the chance that the gNodeB allocates SRS resources

to heavy-traffic UEs first. This allows the use of advanced beamforming for a bigger portion

of downlink traffic in a cell.

| Feature Name           | Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5262                                  |
| Value Package Name     | Massive MIMO Enabler                          |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4004                                  |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                           |
| Access Type            | NR                                            |

Summary and Benefits

SRS resources are allocated to UEs with a heavy-traffic session instead of allocating

the SRS resources to SRS-capable UEs in the order of the arrival of the UEs. UE

sessions are considered heavy traffic if they exceed preconfigured thresholds. This

leads to more efficient use of the SRS resources and increased spectral

efficiency.

Capacity and Performance

A shift towards higher ranges can be observed in the distribution of the following PM

counter values because users with higher downlink traffic are expected to use

advanced beamforming:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoTxRankDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr

In low to medium traffic load, the value of the

NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResUsedAntSwitching counter is expected to

decrease because the SRS resources are allocated more selectively to UEs in the

cell.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes to configure the

thresholds based on which a UE session is labeled heavy traffic:

- NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr
- NRCellDU.nrSrsDlPacketAgeThr

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

| Access Type            | NR                                            |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, advanced MIMO features can be configured to use

half-band SRS. The NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth MO attribute can

be used to switch between full-band and half-band SRS. The half-band SRS setting

allows the UE to transmit SRS with increased coverage. Full-band SRS uses one uplink

OFDM symbol in a special slot, while half-band SRS uses two.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth MO attribute is introduced.

It is not recommended to use half-band SRS in a cell that has less than three uplink

symbols in the special slot (for example, when the

NRCellDU.tddUlDlPattern MO attribute is set to

2), because uplink performance is affected negatively.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Summary and Benefits

The gNodeB determines the advanced beamforming weights based on the uplink SRS

transmissions from the UE. The UE uses all of its SRS ports to transmit SRS, but

some UEs might not be able to transmit SRS with equal power among its SRS ports, and

the quality of some of the SRS ports might not be enough to use advanced

beamforming. In these cases, codebook-based beamforming can provide higher downlink

throughput.

This feature enhancement enables the gNodeB to switch to codebook-based beamforming

in a slot when the SRS SINR of the SRS ports in a UE is insufficient for advanced

beamforming.

For every UE in the cell configured with SRS resources, the gNodeB assesses the

quality of each SRS port of the UE. The SRS SINR of the SRS ports is compared with a

preconfigured threshold, and the SRS ports are considered valid if they exceed the

threshold. The gNodeB switches to codebook-based beamforming if the number of valid

ports is lower than the rank reported by the UE.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink throughput might increase if the gNodeB switches to codebook-based

beamforming when it is more efficient than advanced beamforming, based on the SRS

SINR measurements of the SRS ports of the UE. Depending on the number of UEs

transmitting SRS with different power among their ports, the number of downlink

slots used for advanced beamforming can decrease, which can be observed through the

following counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoTxRankDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoTxRankDistr

This feature enhancement has no associated KPIs. However, the following Performance

Indicators can decrease because fewer advanced beamforming transmissions occur:

- SRS Utilization
- SU-MIMO Average Advanced Downlink Resource Block Symbol Utilization
- SU-MIMO Average Advanced Beamforming PDSCH Resource Block Symbol Utilization
- Average SU-MIMO Advanced Beamforming Users

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables the use of aperiodic SRS in NR Mid-Band cells. The UE

reports aperiodic SRS capability and the gNodeB configures aperiodic SRS for the

UE.

The configuration mechanism for aperiodic SRS is the same as for periodic SRS,

however triggering is handled by DCI format 1\_1, which results in more dynamic

resource allocation compared to periodic SRS. The gNodeB can dynamically trigger UEs

to transmit SRS on demand based on UE traffic, which means SRS resources are used

more efficiently and more UEs can be served with reciprocity-based beamforming.

Aperiodic SRS and periodic SRS cannot be configured for the same cell. All cells

belonging to the same gNodeB need to be configured with either aperiodic SRS or

periodic SRS.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- SRS resources can be more efficiently allocated to active downlink users. The gNodeB does not need to release the SRS resource of the UEs even if the channel quality is not sufficient for reciprocity-based beamforming.
- Downlink performance can be improved in good and medium channel conditions, as more users can be served by the gNodeB using reciprocity-based beamforming.
- The performance of high mobility UE can be improved in low-load cases, because the rapid changes in channel information can be tracked through back-to-back aperiodic SRS triggering.
- The battery life of UEs might be extended because the UE only transmits SRS aperiodically when it has downlink traffic.

Using aperiodic SRS can provide the previously listed benefits if the following

conditions are fulfilled in the cell:

- The traffic load is high.
- The SRS utilization for baseline periodic SRS is high.
- There are enough UEs capable of aperiodic SRS transmission.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement improves average downlink throughput because of the more

efficient use of SRS. Peak throughput is unaffected.

The feature enhancement introduces the following PI to monitor the number of active

SRS users on average:

The performance indicators affected by the feature enhancement are shown in Table 7:

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides another option to help with the decision making of

the gNodeB to choose the most suitable beamforming mode for the UE. Advanced

beamforming is more suitable for stationary or slowly moving UEs. Codebook-based

beamforming provides better throughput for moving UEs.

The estimated effective speed, which takes the Doppler effect into consideration, is

used to switch between advanced and codebook-based beamforming. If the estimated

effective speed of a UE is below configured thresholds, the UE can be granted SRS

resources, and advanced beamforming is used for that UE.

For the beamforming mode switch, hysteresis is considered. This means that the

beamforming mode switch does not occur when the estimated effective speed of the UE

exceeds or drops below a threshold. This way, constant beamforming mode switching

can be avoided that might be otherwise triggered because of estimation noise.

If periodic SRS is configured in the gNodeB, the UE can be configured with periodic

SRS when its estimated effective speed is lower than or equal to the threshold or

thresholds. The SRS resources are released if the estimated effective speed of the

UE exceeds the thresholds.

If aperiodic SRS is configured in the gNodeB, the aperiodic SRS can be triggered if

the estimated effective speed of the UE is lower than or equal to the threshold or

thresholds. Thresholds tuned for periodic SRS might not be optimal for aperiodic

SRS, so they must be retuned to get optimal performance.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement might improve SRS resource utilization, downlink UE

throughput, and downlink cell throughput. For some cells, especially if the

thresholds are configured too low, downlink cell throughput might decrease while the

downlink UE throughput increases.

The distribution of the

measured

effective speed of UEs in a cell can be observed through the

NRCellDU.pmUeEffDopplerSpeedDistr

counter.

The following counters can be used to observe the distribution of resources used by

advanced beamforming and codebook-based beamforming for SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoUserDistr

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh

and the NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh attributes. The feature

enhancement does not take effect if the default values are used. Depending on the UE

estimated effective speed, the feature enhancement operates the following way:

Summary and Benefits

With the feature enhancement, aperiodic and periodic SRS can be configured in the

same cell and on the same gNodeB-DU. The coexisting aperiodic and periodic SRS mode

is enabled with an attribute.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Periodic SRS UE capacity increases when the SRS periodicity of the cell is equal to 80 slots.
- Throughput increases in cells with high load where aperiodic SRS-capable UE penetration is high under good to moderate channel conditions.

One of the following modes is supported in the cell:

- Aperiodic SRS
- Periodic SRS
- Coexisting aperiodic and periodic SRS

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement can improve reciprocity-based beamforming use and downlink

throughput compared to periodic SRS by efficiently using available SRS resources if

the following conditions are met at the specific site:

- 100% SRS use that is reached during busy hour using periodic SRS mode
- Small inter-site distance to ensure good SRS coverage
- High downlink payload, for example more than 50% busy hour downlink resource block symbol use
- High ratio of UEs capable of aperiodic SRS transmission in terms of payload

If the conditions are not met and the feature enhancement is activated, downlink

throughput and reciprocity-based beamforming use might degrade.

The performance of the feature enhancement can be observed through the following PM

counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacActiveSrsUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacRbSymUsedPdschCbRatDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacSrsPdschAgeDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlRat

A degradation in codebook-based MU-MIMO resource utilization might be observed in

networks with a high penetration of aperiodic SRS-capable UEs.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled attribute to enable the

coexistence of aperiodic and periodic SRS-capable UEs in all Mid-Band cells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement is supported on RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5 and

6.

Only UEs capable of aperiodic SRS transmission can benefit from aperiodic SRS.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the gNodeB more accuracy in deciding whether to use

reciprocity-based beamforming, improving downlink performance.

The feature enhancement introduces two attributes that allow the gNodeB to assess if

the SRS transmitted by the UE can be used for reciprocity-based beamforming in the

downlink.

The gNodeB determines if an SRS-configured UE can use reciprocity-based beamforming

for each downlink

slot,

based on the number of SRS ports that are assessed to be usable. If an

SRS-configured UE cannot use reciprocity-based beamforming, codebook-based

beamforming is used.

Depending on the number of UEs that transmit SRS unsuitable for reciprocity-based

beamforming, the feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved downlink cell throughput
- Improved downlink UE throughput
- Improved downlink BLER

Capacity and Performance

The Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PDSCH slot only KPI can be

used to observe the benefits of the feature enhancement.

The DL HARQ BLER PI can be used to observe the benefits of the feature

enhancement.

Codebook-based beamforming might be used as a fallback option for UEs that transmit

unsuitable SRS transmissions. For the effect of the number of such UEs on PIs, see

Table 9.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Average Codebook MIMO PDSCH Resource Block Symbol Utilization                                           | Increases |
| Average Reciprocity MU-MIMO PDSCH Resource Block Symbol                                     Utilization | Decreases |
| Average Reciprocity SU-MIMO PDSCH Resource Block Symbol                                     Utilization | Decreases |

The following PM counters are expected to decrease:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayersDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistrNote: Updated information in 25.Q2: Removed deprecated performance indicators and PM counters.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable
- NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh

There is no interaction between the

NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable and

NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attributes.

The NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute has mandatory

impact at upgrade, while the impact of the

NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute is

optional.
