# 3 Feature Operation of 256-QAM Uplink Low/Mid-Band

To use the feature, both the RAN and the UE need to be 256-QAM capable.

The feature can be enabled by setting the NRCellDU.ul256QamEnabled

attribute to true. If this attribute is set to false,

the feature is disabled.

The operation of the feature is triggered automatically when both the UE and the cell are

confirmed to support the 256-QAM capability.

## 3.1 Operational Process for NR SA

In NR SA, the feature begins to operate during the Initial Context Setup

Process.

Operational Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Initial Context Setup

Process Steps

1. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the UE Context Setup Request message to the gNodeB-DU. UE capability is checked for uplink 256-QAM support. If the UE is capable of uplink 256-QAM support, the 256-QAM MCS Table is sent from the gNodeB-DU to the gNodeB-CU-CP in the UE Context Setup Response message.
2. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the downlink RRC message to the gNodeB-DU.
3. The gNodeB-DU sends the RRCReconfiguration message to the UE.
4. The UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the gNodeB-DU.
5. The gNodeB-DU sends the uplink RRC message to the gNodeB-CU-CP.
6. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the gNodeB-DU. The UE starts using the uplink 256-QAM MCS table.
7. The gNodeB-DU sends the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message to the gNodeB-CU-CP.

## 3.2 Operational Process for EN-DC

In EN-DC, the feature begins to operate during the Secondary Node Addition

Process.

Operational Sequence Diagram

Figure 2   Secondary Node Addition

Process Steps

1. RRC connection is established between the UE and the Master node.
2. The Master Node forwards a Secondary Node Addition Request to the Secondary Node over the X2AP interface. UE capability is checked for uplink 256-QAM support. If the UE is capable of uplink 256-QAM support, the Secondary Node forwards the 256-QAM MCS Table to the UE in the CellGroupConfig Information Element.
3. The Secondary Node acknowledges the Secondary Node Addition Request.
4. The Master Node initiates the RRC Connection Reconfiguration towards the UE.
5. The UE completes the RRC Connection Reconfiguration. The UE starts using the Secondary Node 256-QAM MCS table.
6. The Master Node completes the Secondary Node Reconfiguration. The UE attaches to the NR cell.

# 4 Network Impact of 256-QAM Uplink Low/Mid-Band

The feature increases uplink throughput and spectral efficiency.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases spectral efficiency and the average uplink throughput for

256-QAM capable UEs.
