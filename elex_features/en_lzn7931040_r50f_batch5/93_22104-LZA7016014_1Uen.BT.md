Summary

The Air Interface Load Generator feature enables testing and estimating the effect of

increased load on the field. It can be used for field testing when a specified load

is required, simplifying the testing and significantly reducing the number of

required UEs. The feature significantly reduces field testing in cost and time when

load is required and makes testing more efficient.

# 3 Feature Operation of Air Interface Load Generator

In the LTE system, it must be known whether the network can deal with increased use of

certain services before launching and promoting the services to subscribers. The artificial

load must be generated in the scheduling in downlink. Downlink power needs to be transmitted

on the associated artificial load allocations in downlink.

General Operational Flow

The RBS baseband monitors the load in every TTI by taking the following actions:

- Calculating current total load from ordinary allocations (load from real UEs and not generated load)
- Calculating padding PRBs, rate matching, and selecting the allocations for artificial load
- Transporting the data for artificial load

The RBS baseband monitors the PDCCH load in each TTI by taking the following actions:

- Calculating the number of padding CCEs based on the configured minimum PDCCH load level set by the AirIfLoadProfile.minLoadLevelPdcch attribute and already allocated PDCCH CCEs .

The RBS generates the artificial load to meet the target load level based on the UE load.

The artificial load is lower priority than the real UE.

Figure 1   Artificial Load Added to Minimal DL PRB Load Level

This method refers to PRB padding, which fills up the number of PRBs in the system up to

the required level. PRB padding is a lower priority artificial load than the real UE. The

artificial load in the scheduling can be simplified as the PRB load. The number of PRBs used

for the artificial load is calculated based on the configuration data.Allocating the padding CCEs among available PDCCH CCEs and sending the transport block

to the physical layer for transmission.

When all necessary PDCCH CCEs are allocated for UEs in that TTI, the total number of the

RBS maintains a configured minimum level of PDCCH load in each TTI, by generating artificial

PDCCH load when the PDCCH load generated by real UEs is below the minimum level.

Figure 2   Artificial Load Added to Minimum PDCCH Load Level

If the PDCCH load level for real UEs is already above the minimum PDCCH load level, no

artificial load is generated. The artificial load is generated by means of padding already

allocated PDCCH CCEs with additional PDCCH CCEs containing dummy data up to the configured

minimum level. The artificial PDCCH load is, therefore, also referred to as CCE padding

load.

Load Generation Algorithm

The current load percentage is calculated with the following formula:

(Real UE PRBs) รท (Total PRBs for the bandwidth).

If the current load is less than the level configured in the

AirIfLoadProfile.dlPrbLoadLevel attribute, the number of PRBs for

padding is calculated according to the following formula:

(Padding Load Level - Load) ร (Total PRBs for the bandwidth)รท100

The padding load is calculated by allocating the free PRBs from the low end of the

channel.

Example 1

If the dlConfigurableFrequencyStart is set to 11,

dlFrequencyAllocationProportion is set to 90, and

dlPrbLoadLevel is set to 20, a configuration with 100

PRBs results in no downlink traffic and no AIR Interface Load Generator load on PRB 0-9, and

AIR Interface Load Generator Load on PRB 10-19, if less than 10 PRBs are allocated for

payload.

Artificial Load Transport

The modulation for padding PRBs is configurable through the

AirIfLoadProfile.ailgLowPrioModType attribute.

CRC does not have to be calculated because the artificial load data is not used by any

UE.

# 4 Network Impact Air Interface Load Generator

The feature has temporary capacity impact, which is present while the generated load

persists.

Capacity and Performance

The feature generates a configured amount of extra load for testing purposes only.

While coverage is unaffected, on the border of the tested cell, the UE handover occurs

earlier because of higher interference than in the neighboring cells. To keep these UEs in

the tested cell, handover parameters must be adjusted.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Air Interface Load Generator

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010955 MO instance.
2. Execute the EUtranCellFDD.startAilg or the EUtranCellTDD.startAilg action.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Air Interface Load Generator

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010955 MO instance.
2. Execute the EUtranCellFDD.stopAilg or the EUtranCellTDD.stopAilg action.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Configure Air Interface Load Generator

The configuration of the Air Interface Load Generator is determined by the following

parameters:

- AirIfLoadProfile.ailgChangePeriod
- AirIfLoadProfile.ailgLoadType
- AirIfLoadProfile.ailgLowPrioModType
- AirIfLoadProfile.dlPrbLoadLevel
- AirIfLoadProfile.minLoadLevelPdcch

The following parameters are not supported:

- AirIfLoadProfile.ailgHighPrio
- AirIfLoadProfile.noOfOcngPrbSeries
- AirIfLoadProfile.ocngPrbSerie

The AirIfLoadProfile.ailgLoadType parameter cannot be set to

PDSCH\_BF\_TYPE2 and PDSCH\_BF\_TYPE2\_AND\_PDCCH because the

Air Interface Load Generator on the Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card in conversion mode

can only generate one beam in one TTI.

Minimal load level associated with downlink PRB use is expressed as a percentage.

The Air Interface Load Generator feature requires that the corresponding license is

installed. For more information on handling licenses, see Manage

Licenses.

Start and Stop Air Interface Load Generator

To start the Air Interface Load Generator, use the

EUtranCellFDD.startAilg or the

EUtranCellTDD.startAilg action.

To stop the Air Interface Load Generator, use the EUtranCellFDD.stopAilg

or the EUtranCellTDD.stopAilg action.

Automatic Restart of Air Interface Load Generator

Set the EUtranCellFDD.ailgAutoRestartEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.ailgAutoRestartEnabled attribute to

true to automatically restart the Air Interface Load Generator after the

following events occur:

- Cell lock and unlock
- Node start
- Node restart
