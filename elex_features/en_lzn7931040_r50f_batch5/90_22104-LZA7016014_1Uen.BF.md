Summary

The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature assists in ensuring that the QoS is

maintained for the already established GBR bearers after a successful initial setup.

This is achieved through limiting the number of GBR bearers based on resource

utilization. This feature allows the setup of new GBR bearers if the GBR bearers do

not exceed a configured threshold during the use of the MSR.

The main purpose of this feature is to ensure that the QoS is maintained for GBR

bearers in the system. Enabling this feature creates a headroom that allows

fluctuating radio conditions and mobility. The headroom can also be used to control

the ratio between GBR and non-GBR traffic. Furthermore, a dynamic method of

measuring the resource utilization by GBR bearers allows for a more efficient use of

resources. This measurement method helps avoiding unnecessary rejections.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dynamic GBR Admission Control

The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature measures and decides if it allows or

rejects incoming GBR requests, based on MSR usage.

Dynamic GBR Admission Control is performed by monitoring the use of MSRs. The use of the

MSRs are measured during a measurement period. After that period, a filtered value is

calculated for the use of the MSRs. The filtered value of MSR usage is updated after

each new measurement period.

As Figure 1 shows, after a GBR bearer setup, the

use of each MSR is checked against a configured threshold. The GBR request is only

allowed if the resource does not exceed the threshold.

If any GBR bearer is rejected during handover procedure, following behavior is expected:

| X2 handover   |    | When the E-RABs Admitted List IE (transferred in HANDOVER REQUEST                             ACKNOWLEDGE) does not contain all original GBR bearers, a                                 X2 HO Cancel message is sent to the                             target cell by the source cell.   |
|---------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| S1 handover   |    | When the E-RABs to Release List IE (transferred in HANDOVER COMMAND)                             contains any of the original GBR bearers, a S1 HO                                 Cancel message is sent to the EPC by the source                             cell.                      |

If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, dynamic MSR reservations in

downlink are made for PTT bearers. The admission control features update the MSR

reservations in downlink for PTT bearers when admitting and releasing GBR bearers.

Figure 1   GBR Admission Threshold

The MSRs considered are the following:

- Uplink GBR PRB use for each cell
- Uplink GBR PRB use for each RBS
- Downlink GBR PRB use for each cell
- Downlink GBR PRB use for each RBS
- Uplink GBR SE use for each cell
- Uplink GBR SE use for each RBS
- Downlink GBR SE use for each cell
- Downlink GBR SE use for each RBS
- GBR CCE use
- Uplink GBR Baseband Capacity use for each RBS
- Downlink GBR Baseband Capacity use for each RBS

Operational Process

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature gets an E-RAB GBR request.
2. The feature determines if the cause of the request is connected to mobility issues.
    1. If the request is due to mobility issues, the feature admits the request.
    2. If the request is not connected to mobility issues, the feature rejects the request.
3. The feature determines if the request has privileged access. Note: If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control and the Differentiated Admission Control features are activated together, the handling of privileged access is modified.
    1. If the request has privileged access, the feature admits the request.
    2. If the request does not have privileged access, the feature rejects the request.
4. The feature determines there are available resources to complete the request.
    1. If the feature has available resources, it admits the request.
    2. If the feature does not have available resources, it rejects the request.

# 4 Network Impact of Dynamic GBR Admission Control

The Dynamic GBR

Admission Control feature improves the quality of service.

Capacity and Performance

The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature limits the amount of resources used by GBR

bearers. This helps to ensure that the quality of service is fulfilled for GBR

bearers within the system, but comes at a cost of accordingly reduced GBR capacity.

As the feature also provides a headroom for non-GBR bearers, the non-GBR capacity

improves in scenarios with a high load from GBR bearers.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

# 5 Parameters of Dynamic GBR Admission Control

The Dynamic GBR Admission Control

feature uses already existing MOM attributes for the configuration of threshold values and

QCI.

| Accessibility | The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature introduces a                                     configurable GBR threshold and several checkpoints, regarding                                     the admittance of GBR requests. Because of that, the operator                                     can expect a decrease in metrics.                   |
| Retainability | The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature introduces the dynamic                                     resource usage measurement and the option to control the ration                                     between GBR and non-GBR traffic. Because of that, the operator                                     can expect an increase in the metrics. |

Benefits

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature continuously estimates the maximum amount

of dynamic resources needed in downlink for PTT traffic. PTT reservations are

immediately updated when admitting or releasing PTT bearers. By activating the

enhancement, the algorithm of the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature becomes

available for the affected features and function. They become capable for

considering the dynamic PTT downlink MSR reservation at MSR use calculation. The

enhancement ensures the following benefits for the following affected features and

function:

- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature allows only those UEs to be admitted that can be adequately served.
- The Preferential Traffic Management function improves blocking handovers for non-priority UEs and blocking idle mode camping when PTT UEs are present in the eNodeB. This feature is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.
- The Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature improves prioritizing cell resources for RRC connected users if there is high load.
- An attribute is introduced for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature to control the rejection of the privileged access bearer setup requests. Also, improved handover and re-establishment rejection observability is ensured for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control and the Enhanced PTT Admission Control features. Dynamic GBR Admission Control is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.

Capacity and Performance

When the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, it dynamically reserves

resources for PTT users. This can impact the node capacity beside providing stable

performance in high load cases with PTT service active.

Operation

The enhancement introduces three new parameters related to dynamic reservation of

resources for PTT users and resource use for privileged access users.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement can be operated on the following Baseband Units:

- Baseband 5212
- Baseband 5216
- Baseband 6303
- Baseband 6318
- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630
