# 1 A-GPS Control Plane Location Support Overview

The A-GPS Control Plane Location Support feature in the RBS enables the operator to keep

the location node updated about the geographic data of the cells served by the

RBS.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1792                                  |
| Value Package Name:     | Location Support                              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                  |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                           |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each radio. |

Summary

An update is sent whenever a change occurs in any of the cell parameters. The location node

uses the cell data when compiling the assistance data sent to the UE on the control

plane bearer. The location node also uses the data when, for the UE assisted mode,

it calculates the UE positioning based on the GNSS measurements reported by the UE.

The location node in the control plane architecture is the E-SMLC.

The A-GPS method is the main positioning method (accuracy of 20-50 meters) to enable the

operator to comply with the FCC phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning of

emergency calls.

Furthermore, it can serve as the positioning method for a wide variety of commercial services,

which require high location accuracy.

# 2 Dependencies of A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- A location node, that is, an E-SMLC is defined and available in the network.

# 3 Feature Operation of A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

A-GPS Control Plane Location feature helps to keep the location node updated with the

geographical data of the cells by sending cell data to the

UE.

The location node uses cell data to compile and send the assistance data to the UE on the

control plane bearer. In any case, when there is a change in cell parameters, an update

is sent by the location node to the UE. The location node also uses data, when it

calculates the UE positioning based on the GNSS measurements for the assisted mode.

# 4 Network Impact of A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

This feature has no impact on the

network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications for A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

This feature in the RBS enables the operator to keep the location node updated, through

the OSS, about the geographic data of the cells served by the RBS. An update is sent

whenever a change occurs in any of the cell parameters. The location node uses the cell

data when compiling the assistance data sent to the UE on the control plane bearer. The

location node also uses the data when, for the UE assisted mode, it calculates the UE

positioning based on the GNSS measurements reported by the UE.

The UE's location information will be known. The A-GPS methods have a typical accuracy of

20-50 m. The UE forwards its position upon request.

For more information, see A-GPS Control Plane Location Support.

# 6 Performance of A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators, counters or

events.

# 7 Activate A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011067 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate A-GPS Control Plane Location Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011067 MO instance.

After This Task
