Summary

The QoS-Aware Scheduler feature allows the configuration of the scheduler on a QCI basis. This

can be used to configure absolute priority scheduling for DRBs, in regard to air

interface resources. It also enables configuration of scheduling algorithms for each

QCI, given that appropriate scheduler licenses are in place.

Absolute priority for DRBs must be applied conservatively. It is recommended to use for

prioritization of QCI1 (Voice over IP) and QCI5 (IMS signaling) only. It is not

recommended to be used for non-GBR traffic, unless it corresponds to infrequent and

low-intensity traffic similar to signaling. Because the scheduling in uplink is

performed for each LCG, it is not recommended to mix QCIs with and without absolute

priority in the same LCG. Moreover, SRB1 and SRB2 are always allocated to LCG 0. As

a result, any QCI allocated to LCG 0 in uplink inherits the scheduling settings of

absolute priority scheduling assigned to SRB1/2. It is recommended only to assign

QCIs that correspond to signaling-like traffic to LCG 0. for bearers with

high-intensity traffic leads to dropping of UEs with less prioritized bearers. The

reason for this dropping is because of undelivered RLC AM status PDUs.

# 3 Feature Operation of QoS-Aware Scheduler

The QoS-Aware Scheduler assigns the

priorities and the scheduling algorithm, then initiates the scheduling.

The process for scheduling is described in Scheduler. This process also applies for QoS-aware scheduling, except that

the differentiated priorities of DRBs are considered when absolute priority scheduling

is enabled for a QCI.

Operational Process

1. The QoS-Aware Scheduler feature enters into a configuration phase.
    1. The QoS-Aware Scheduler feature assigns priorities to the QCIs, using the QciProfilePredefined.priority and QciProfilePredefined.priorityFraction parameters. The priorities are calculated with the following formula: Priority = QciProfilePredefined.priority + 0.1 x QciProfilePredefined.priorityFraction. Absolute priority is enabled on a QCI basis by theQciProfilePredefined.absPrioOverride parameter.
    2. The scheduling algorithm is selected on a QCI basis by the QciProfilePredefined.schedulingAlgorithm parameter.
    3. Channel quality compensation for scheduling can be enabled by setting the ENodeBFunction.channelQualityMode parameter to COMPENSATED. Note: The Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature must be activated. One of the following Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler algorithms must be chosen: Proportional Fair High Proportional Fair Medium Proportional Fair Low Maximum C/I
2. At the beginning of each TTI, the QoS-Aware Scheduler feature receives information that which radio resources, channel conditions, and data is transmitted.
3. If resources are available, the QoS-Aware Scheduler checks the baseband capacity.
4. A UE to be scheduled is validated to ensure that it is available for data transmission and it is synchronized.
5. A UE that is scheduled is chosen based on the priority and scheduling weight of its radio bearers.
6. If a UE is validated, the QoS-Aware Scheduler feature, together with Link Adaptation and Power Control, allocates an appropriate amount of resources to the UE. PRBs are allocated as scheduling elements on a subframe for each TTI basis. Transport format selection, which determines the TBS and transport format, is conducted by the Link Adaptation function.
7. The QoS-Aware Scheduler receives feedback on channel quality.

Additional Information

During the operation of the QoS-Aware Scheduler feature, keep in mind the following

information:

- For QCIs with the QciProfilePredefined.absPrioOverride parameter set to NO\_OVERRIDE, downlink scheduling maps the DRB to a default priority level lower, than any other DRB priority.
- For QCIs with the QciProfilePredefined.absPrioOverride parameter set to HI\_PRIO\_OVERRIDE, downlink scheduling considers the QciProfilePredefined.priority parameter of the DRB as the QCI provides it.
- In an LCG, where the QCI with the most important priority has the QciProfilePredefined.absPrioOverride parameter set to NO\_OVERRIDE, uplink scheduling maps the LCG to a default priority level lower, than any DRB priority.
- In an LCG where the QCI with the most important priority has the QciProfilePredefined.absPrioOverride parameter set to HI\_PRIO\_OVERRIDE, uplink scheduling maps the LCG to the QciProfilePredefined.priority parameter of the same QCI.
- The parameter QciProfilePredefined.schedulingAlgorithm that corresponds to the QCI with the most important priority is selected to represent the scheduling algorithm of the LCG.
- When a QCI is assigned to LCG 0, the scheduler uses a higher priority, than for other LCGs. The priority is similar to that used for SRBs.

Channel Quality Compensation for Scheduling

If the ENodeBFunction.channelQualityMode parameter is set to

COMPENSATED, the eNodeB performs scheduling weight compensation

based on the GINR and the rank of a UE.

Instead of being configured

on

a QCI basis, the

ENodeBFunction.channelQualityMode parameter affects the

following scheduling algorithms:

- Proportional Fair High
- Proportional Fair Medium
- Proportional Fair Low
- Maximum C/I

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q4: QCI-Based Prioritization with One Decimal Point

This enhancement introduces priority with one decimal place for all QCIs.

| Feature Name:           | QoS-Aware Scheduler                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0859                       |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement improves QCI-based scheduling by allowing priorities to be defined using

one decimal place, not only integers. It is applicable for all predefined and

operator-defined QCIs. This makes scheduling more detailed and flexible, allowing more

services to have different priorities.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement provides a possibility to fine-tune priority to a higher degree,

which enables more flexible scheduling for selected services.

Operation

With this enhancement, the range of possible priorities change from 1 to 14 to 0.1 to

14.0. The smallest increment is 0.1. This is achieved with the following

parameters:

Table 5   Parameters

| Parameter                                  | Description                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QciProfilePredefined.priorityFraction      | Defines the decimal point of the new priority for predefined                                     QCIs.       |
| QciProfileOperatorDefined.priorityFraction | Defines the decimal point of the new priority for                                     operator-defined QCIs. |

The priority is calculated with the following formula:

Priority = QciProfilePredefined.priority + 0.1 x

QciProfilePredefined.priorityFraction

Example 1   Priority Calculation

|   Priority |   QciProfilePredefined.priority |   QciProfilePredefined.priorityFraction |
|------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|        0.1 |                               0 |                                       1 |
|        1   |                               1 |                                       0 |
|        5.6 |                               5 |                                       6 |
|       14   |                              14 |                                       0 |
