Summary

An operator

is

given the option to Theft Deterrence Lock the node to a list of PLMN IDs.

Subsequently, activating the node in networks with other PLMN IDs is not

possible.

The benefit of the feature is to reduce the frequency of theft of Baseband units by

making it significantly harder to use stolen Baseband units in another network.

# 2 Dependencies of Theft Deterrence

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature has the following limitations:

- If a node is downgraded to a software version older than 23.Q4, then the locked node does not behave as intended.
- If a node is downgraded to a software version based on 23.Q4 or later, but older than 25.Q2, then the locked node behaves as follows: The Operator List is not shown under the TheftDeterrence.thdStoredId attribute and is completely non-functional. For more information on Operator List, see Operator List Handling. The authentication type does not show correctly under the TheftDeterrence.thdAuthenticationType attribute if the node is locked permanently.
- If a node is shared between multiple operators by Multi-Operator Core Network or Multi-Operator RAN, this feature will collect the PLMN IDs of multiple operators to lock the shared node. Management of the password used to lock the node must be agreed between the operators.
- It is not possible to lock or unlock theft deterrence while the failsafe backup function is active on the node. For more information about the failsafe backup function, see Manage Software.
- Lock and unlock actions for theft deterrence are also unavailable during ongoing upgrade, backup restore, autointegration, and warm restart.
- In case of hardware replacement, the status of theft deterrence is lost and a previously locked equipment needs to be re-locked.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Theft Deterrence

This feature implements theft deterrence by uniquely tying the PLMN IDs of the

operator to the hardware of the individual Baseband unit.

## 3.1 Theft Deterrence Locking with Password

To make the locking process safer, it is recommended to check the currently configured

PLMN IDs and Operator List through the TheftDeterrence.displayPlmnIds

action and compare PLMN IDs manually.

The operator invokes the TheftDeterrence.lock action and provides an

operator-controlled password,

triggering the

node

into

the theft deterrence locked state.

In

the

locking

mechanism,

the node collects the information containing all configured unique PLMN IDs from RATs

and optionally an Operator List from License Key File and a valid operator-controlled

password, and store it in an

encrypted and

integrity protected

lock token

in persistent storage, to tie it to the network of that operator.

When a node is in the theft deterrence locked state, the node can function in the network

with PLMN IDs equal to the lock token or a subset of these or, if the Operator List is

used, the node can function in the network with any combination of the PLMN IDs from the

Operator List. If the system detects a mismatch between the actual PLMN ID list and the

valid PLMN ID list when the node is locked, the system enters a misconfiguration state.

The misconfiguration raises the Theft Deterrence Board Restore

Pending alarm, which causes the node to revert to initial state after

a predetermined grace period. During the grace period, the node can be unlocked. For

more information, see Theft Deterrence Unlocking.

The node must be unlocked under the following circumstances:

- The operator sends the node for repair.
- The operator needs to legally resell the node.
- The functionality does not work or any other reason that the operator must unlock the node.

### 3.1.1 Operator-Controlled Password

The locking and unlocking operations use a password chosen

by

and known to

only

the operator, to authenticate that the correct operator is performing

these operations.

The operator-controlled password must comply with the following policies:

- The password must be at least 12 characters long.
- The password must contain at least three lower case characters.
- The password must contain at least three upper case characters.
- The password must contain at least two numeric characters.
- The password must contain at least one special case character.

## 3.2 Theft Deterrence Locking without Password

To make the locking process safer, it is recommended to check the currently configured

PLMN IDs and Operator List through the TheftDeterrence.displayPlmnIds

action and compare PLMN IDs manually.

The operator invokes the TheftDeterrence.lockPermanently action, then

the node is in a permanently locked state.

In this case, it is not possible to unlock the node.

## 3.3 Theft Deterrence Unlocking

The operator invokes the TheftDeterrence.unlock action and provides

the same password that was provided during the locking step,

triggering

the node into the theft deterrence unlocked state. This is only

possible for a node with the LOCKED state of the

TheftDeterrence.thdStatus attribute.

## 3.4 Operator List Handling

The Operator List is used to configure all possible PLMN IDs for a specific operator.

This list is configured, installed, and updated through the license key file. This is

done in preparation for future relocation of the node to other areas within the operator

network.

When the operator wants to update Operator List, the following conditions must be

fulfilled:

- The new Operator List must contain all PLMN IDs that the operator intends to configure in all nodes that will use the operator list.
- The new Operator List must contain all currently configured PLMN IDs.

## 3.5 Responsibility for Locking Password

The customer takes full responsibility for managing password used for the nodes with

LOCKED state. This password is stored in an integrity protected and

encrypted

form on the individual node to validate its correctness when the customer attempts to

unlock a node, but otherwise not permanently stored in any other location. The customer

is responsible for management and use of the password.

## 3.6 Advice on Theft Deterrence System Interactions

As the Theft Deterrence feature has certain interactions with other parts of the system,

the following scenarios must be noticed when the node is in a LOCKED or

LOCKED\_PERMANENTLY state:

- Other PLMN IDs not belonging to the customer cannot be used.
- The autointegration procedure is interrupted if the system detects the configuration of new network including incorrect PLMN IDs.
- The backup restore procedure is rejected if the system detects the backup including incorrect PLMN IDs.

## 3.7 Handling of Theft Deterrence Locked Nodes in Repair

If a node is in the

LOCKED state,

the

customer must assure that theft deterrence is in an

UNLOCKED

state when sending a Baseband unit for repair.

The incurred repair cost due to the equipment not meeting following requirements is the

responsibility of the customer:

- The node being sent into a repair center is in unlocked state.
- Management of the Theft Deterrence password.

This additional cost is incurred due to disruptions and additional handling when locked

nodes are received at local screening centers, which do not have the necessary processes

and equipment to identify and remedy locked nodes.

If a node is in the LOCKED\_PERMANENTLY state, a special treatment is

needed for repair as the node cannot be unlocked.

# 4 Network Impact of Theft Deterrence

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance
