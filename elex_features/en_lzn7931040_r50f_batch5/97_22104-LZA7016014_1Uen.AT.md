Summary

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature allows the operator to control the bit rate

proportions. Services are assigned the proportions through a specific QCI parameter in

relation to other services using other QCIs.

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature provides the specified bit rate ratios when either

the radio conditions are ignored (equal rate), or when all UEs have similar radio

conditions. Otherwise, the difference in experienced radio conditions influences the

resulting bit rate proportions (proportional fair).

Example 1

If UE 1 has a relative priority of 2 and UE 2 has a relative priority of 3, the following

ratios apply:

- UE 1 gets two thirds times the throughput of UE 2.
- UE 2 gets three halves times the throughput of UE 1.

Additional Information

For more information on how the scheduler balances the difference in radio conditions and

rate proportions caused by selected fairness, see Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler.

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of Relative Priority Scheduling

The feature operation of the Relative Priority Scheduling feature depends on working

with other features to get the expected ratios when the feature is active.

The following conditions should be meet to ensure optimal performance of this feature:

- All UEs have the same radio frequency conditions (for example, the same SINR, CQI, and RI (Rank Indicator) values).
- The bit rate received at the eNodeB for a bearer should be higher than the rate expected for that bearer.
- The cell should be congested which means that PRB utilization is recommended to be around 90%.
- The maximum downlink throughput must not exceed 150 Mbps, while the maximum uplink throughput must not exceed 75 Mbps for each UE.

## 3.1 Feature Interaction

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature interacts with the Minimum

Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature.

### 3.1.1 Minimal Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler Interaction

The following points highlight the Relative Priority Scheduling and Minimum Rate Proportional

Fair Scheduler interacting features:

- The Relative Priority Scheduling feature modifies the rate component of a specific Proportional Fair Scheduler fairness degree.
- The Relative Priority Scheduling feature is used to differentiate services within a Proportional Fair Scheduler fairness degree.
- The Relative Priority Scheduling feature distributes the bit rate within a fairness variant. This way the ratio of relative priorities corresponds the ratio of targeted bit rates.

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature takes advantage of how the Minimum Rate Proportional

Fair Scheduler feature considers rate. Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature aims

for bit rate ratios according to the ratio of relative priorities. This applies when the

fairness variant of the Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature for the bearers is

the same. Channel conditions are also the same or not considered by the Minimum Rate

Proportional Fair Scheduler feature. When Absolute Priority Override is enabled for some QCI

entries, these entries use the same priority to see the bit rate proportions indicated by the

relative priorities.

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature can be combined with the following algorithms:

- Equal Rate The combination ignores radio conditions.
- Proportional Fair High The combination offers more emphasis on cell edge throughput.
- Proportional Fair Medium The combination offers optimal trade off at high load.
- Proportional Fair Low The combination offers more emphasis on cell capacity.
- Resource Fair Scheduling The combination supports round robin.

For more information, see Scheduler.

### 3.1.2 Minimum Rate Interaction

It is possible to configure the minimum rate for uplink and downlink in a QCI that has

Relative Priority Scheduling enabled. In this case, the minimum rate is used with the Relative

Priority Scheduling when a service bit rate is below the minimum rate configured.

When two or more services are under their minimum rate, the service

with the higher combined relative priority and priority receives a

higher scheduling priority.

### 3.1.3 Uplink Relative Priority Scheduling

In the uplink direction, QCI entries are grouped into LCGs per UE. Supported LCGs are

described in QoS-Aware Scheduler.

The relative priority of an LCG is determined by the bearer with the highest QCI priority

that is currently established in the LCG. The QCI of this bearer determines the relative

priority of the LCG.

Uplink Relative Priority Scheduling can differentiate data services for different

subscriptions.

The attribute priority, that is absolute priority, is used when an LCG contains more than one

active bearer for a particular user. The user chooses the QCI for which relative

priority is selected for the Uplink Relative Priority Scheduling group (QCI).

When the number of Scheduling Entity for each TTI is not exceeded in a TTI, resource fair or

Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling allocation between the users

is used. Relative priority is effectively not used.

For uplink, a difference in relative priority can only be seen when the Scheduling Entity for

each TTI limit is exceeded within a TTI or if the PDCCH resource is congested within a

TTI.

Example 2

LCG can be allocated to QCI 7, 8, or 9. A relative priority is allocated to one user LCG

who has a QCI 7 setup and a different relative priority is allocated to second user LCG who

has a QCI 9 setup.
