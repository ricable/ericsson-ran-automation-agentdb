Summary

By

enabling different DRX parameter settings for different services,

the

Service Specific DRX feature enables

optimized

configurations on a service

level.

This way, UE battery can be saved with

less

negative impact on the system performance. This feature introduces QoS Class

Identifier (QCI) dependent DRX settings which are defined by the operator.

The feature has the following benefits:

- DRX configuration is chosen based on the primary service of the current UE configured by the operator.
- This feature provides both UE battery savings and reduced negative DRX impact on system performance. Using the eMBMS VoLTE DRX (drxProfile=18) provides further battery savings by allowing service specific DRX for VoLTE in coexistence with eMBMS.
- By disabling DRX at voice call setup, the feature improves call setup time.
- It is possible to disable DRX in poor coverage conditions for VoIP service without TTI Bundling enabled. Disabling DRX in poor coverage conditions is also possible for non-VoIP services.

# 2 Dependencies of Service Specific DRX

The feature requires the Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE feature. It affects

features using the DRX function.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The Disabling DRX at Voice Call Setup function requires that the UE supports

capabilities defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 version 12.12.0 or later, and

the mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE introduced in 3GPP TS 36.331

version 12.8.0.

# 3 Feature Operation of Service Specific DRX

The Service Specific DRX feature includes an extended DRX profile table with 19 DRX

profiles that can be configured by the operator.

Each DRX profile contains a set of DRX settings (drxConfigIdx). The

DRX settings depend on the QCI and the DRX capabilities of the UE. The DRX profile table

is eNodeB-based.

Operational Process

1. All cells of the eNodeB have to be locked so the changes in DRX configuration do not trigger RRC reconfiguration to all connected UEs.
2. The DRX profile is configured in the MOM using the DRX parameters. Table 2 DRX Profile Table DrxProfile.drxProfileId 0 (default) ANR (not configured by operator) DrxProfile.drxProfileId 1 DrxProfile.drxProfileId 2 [...] DrxProfile.drxProfileId 17 DrxProfile.drxProfileId 18 drxConfigIdx 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 [...] 39 40 41 DrxProfile.onDurationTimer DrxProfile.onDurationTimer DrxProfile.onDurationTimer DrxProfile.onDurationTimer DrxProfile.onDurationTimer ...

3. Changes take effect after the first eNodeB cell is unlocked.

Disabling DRX at Voice Call Setup

This function delays the configuration of DRX at voice call setup, with the following

steps:

1. The UE sends connection request with the mo-VoiceCall-v1280 establishment cause.
2. The eNodeB starts the guard timer defined by ENodeBFunction.tMoVoiceBearerEstSupervision, and does not configure DRX.
3. If a QCI1 bearer is established, the eNodeB stops the guard timer and configures DRX according to the configured DRX profile.
4. If the guard timer expires before a QCI1 bearer is established, the eNodeB configures DRX according to the configured DRX profile.

Disabling DRX in Poor Radio Frequency

Setting the attribute DrxProfile.drxState to

ENABLED\_COVERAGE\_OPTIMIZED allows the eNodeB to enable or

disable DRX on the UE according to its coverage situation.

## 3.1 DRX Combined with eMBMS and VoLTE Coexistence

The combination of DRX and eMBMS with VoLTE can reduce the possibilities for downlink

scheduling. Using the eMBMS VoLTE DRX profile provides betters battery savings.

Using DRX and eMBMS together with VoLTE can limit the possibilities for downlink

scheduling, when too many awake PDCCH subframes coincide with MBSFN. This is because

unicast cannot be scheduled on MBSFN. The DRX awake periods are spread in time and many

eMBMS configurations can create different overlap problems for different UEs. If there

are too few consecutive PDCCH subframes without overlap, a DRX configuration is chosen

to keep the UE always awake.

Using the eMBMS VoLTE DRX (drxProfile=18) provides better battery

performance by allowing service specific DRX for VoLTE in coexistence with eMBMS. When

eMBMS is activated and a VoLTE bearer is set up, the system selects the eMBMS VoLTE DRX

profile. The eMBMS VoLTE DRX profile is equal to the DRX profile for VoLTE except for

the attribute DrxProfile.drxRetransmissionTimer which is set to

PSF4.

The default setting for DrxProfile.drxRetransmissionTimer is two PDCCH

subframes. However, it is set to four PDCCH subframes in the eMBMS VoLTE DRX profile.

The eMBMS VoLTE DRX profile is used as if at least two consecutive subframes are not

used for MBSFN while the timer defined by DrxOnDurationTimer is

running. Otherwise, the DRX inactivity timer is overridden and set to 200 ms which keeps

the UE always awake during a VoLTE call.

# 4 Network Impact of Service Specific DRX

The feature minimizes the disadvantages of DRX by  enabling DRX configuration on a

service level.

Capacity and Performance

This feature minimizes the negative DRX impact. However, the feature can negatively

affect network performance and capacity, such as UE throughput.

The feature can also negatively impact mobility and handover success rate. There is a

possibility to fully disable DRX in an area with poor radio frequency.

The UE battery savings and the negative DRX impact must be balanced by the

configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of Service Specific DRX

The feature uses already existing parameters to configure and refer to DRX

profiles.

# 6 Performance of Service Specific DRX

This feature is related to KPIs for latency, mobility and throughput

measurements.

KPIs

This feature can have an impact on some KPIs, such as DL Latency, Mobility Success

Rate and UE Throughput. The KPI impact depends on current conditions, such as

configuration, individual device implementation, system, and traffic types.

No KPI formula is affected when VoLTE, eMBMS, and DRX are used with less than 30%

eMBMS allocation. However, the following KPI and counter values are affected when

VoLTE, eMBMS, and DRX are used with at least 30% eMBMS allocation:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmDrxSleepTime and EUtranCellTDD.pmDrxSleepTime: The sleep time decreases for some UEs, since they are randomly distributed in time.
- VoLTE Integrity KPI: It is improved at low to medium VoLTE load.

Counters

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnReconfNoDrxMoVoice
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnReconfNoDrxMoVoice

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Service Specific DRX

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE feature is activated.
- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011327 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Service Specific DRX

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011327 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q2: Disable DRX in Poor Radio Frequency

This enhancement provides the opportunity to disable DRX in poor RF without the need for having TTI Bundling enabled and QCI1 bearer set up.

Benefits

This enhancement to the Service Specific DRX feature provides the opportunity to

disable DRX in poor RF without the need for having TTI Bundling enabled and QCI1

bearer set up.

Capacity and Performance

The integrity and the mobility performance of the UE is increased and the quality of voice

service is better supported when the UE is in an area with weak coverage. Battery

saving for the UE and the DRX impact must be balanced according to the network

planning in such areas.

Operation

When DrxProfile.drxState is set to

ENABLED\_COVERAGE\_OPTIMIZED, the eNodeB enables or disables DRX

on the UE according to its coverage situation.

This enhancement has no associated KPIs but it can have an impact on some KPIs. DL

latency for the UE can decrease, handover success rate, and UE throughput can

increase and voice service quality in weak coverage area can improve. The KPI impact

depends on current conditions, such as configuration, individual device

implementation, UE numbers, system, and traffic types.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The feature requires that ENM 18.1 or later version is used to support the new configuration

parameter.

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q4: Disabling DRX at Voice Call Setup

This enhancement enables DRX configuration to be delayed during voice call setup.

After the call is established, DRX is started according to the configured DRX

profile.s
