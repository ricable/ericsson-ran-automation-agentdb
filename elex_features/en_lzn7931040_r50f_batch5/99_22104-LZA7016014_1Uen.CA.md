Summary

The Public Warning System feature comprises the ETWS and the CMAS cell broadcast

functions.

Figure 1 shows that the warning

notifications created by the Cell Broadcast Entity (CBE) are forwarded to the eNodeB

by the CBC and the MME.

Figure 1   Public Warning System Architecture

The eNodeB receives the notifications on the S1-C interface from the MME in the S1AP

WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message. The following information

is indicated in the message:

- Source and notification type
- Repetition period
- Number of repetitions
- Geofencing information

The repetition period is indicated by the Repetition Period IE (0 -

4095 s), but if the Extended Repetition Period IE (4096 - 131071 s)

is present, it overrides the value in the Repetition Period.

The number of repetitions is indicated by the Number of Broadcasts

Requested IE (0 - 65535). The Validity Time of the notification is the

product of Repetition Period and Number of Broadcasts Requested.

The notifications are broadcast in the cells and indicated in the Warning

Area List IE or, if this element is not included, in all cells handled

by the eNodeB.

Geofencing information is sent from the MME to the eNodeB over the S1-C interface in

the S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message.

The S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE message indicates to the MME

whether the eNodeB is able to perform the requested broadcast in all requested

cells, or in which cells.

The PWS Restart Indication procedure, as described by 3GPP TS 36.413, Rel.

12.1.0, ensures that expired and no longer wanted PWS warning

notifications are not broadcast after a node restart or a complete S1 link failure.

This is achieved by clearing the PWS configuration on the eNodeB. The procedure

introduces the S1AP PWS RESTART INDICATION message sent by the eNodeB

to the MME after a node restart or a complete S1 link failure. Based on the message

content, the CBC evaluates if PWS warning notifications that the eNodeB could not

broadcast are still valid and need to be reloaded, or expired and no longer

desired.

The MME can only send the S1AP KILL REQUEST message to CMAS to cancel

an ongoing broadcast. The outcome of the received cancel request is indicated in the

S1AP KILL RESPONSE message by the eNodeB.

ETWS has the following types of warning notifications:

| Primary   |    | The primary notification contains the type of                                 the disaster, and can be the following:  Earthquake only     Tsunami only     Both earthquake and tsunami      It is broadcast in System Information Block Type 10 (SIB10). The                             requirement is that it must be broadcast within 4 seconds after it                             reaches the border of the operator network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Secondary |    | The secondary notification is broadcast in System Information Block Type                             11 (SIB11). The secondary notification                                 contains information relevant to the disaster. These can contain for                                 example, information of blocked roads and where to seek help. Only                                 one secondary notification is broadcast at a time, and it is                                 repeated a number of times within a specified period as requested by                                 CBC. To cope with large information contents, the secondary                                 notification can be segmented and sent in a sequence of up to 64                                 instances of a SIB. Numbering the segments allows the UE to                                 recompile the original message from the received segments. |

The CMAS alerts are broadcast in System Information Block Type 12 (SIB12). In

contrast to the ETWS secondary notification, concurrent CMAS alerts can be broadcast

simultaneously. Up to 64 CMAS alerts can be broadcast in a sequence of unsegmented

SIB12 instances. If a CMAS alert needs to be segmented, the possible number of

concurrent CMAS alerts are reduced by one for each added segment.

The ETWS part of the Public Warning System enables operators

to comply with the legal requirement to support ETWS. Users with ETWS capable UEs get

early warning of a disaster and additional instructions based on their specific

location.

The CMAS part of the Public Warning System feature enables operators in general to

offer a warning broadcast service as a competitive advantage. CMAS complies with the

American WARN system and supports the KPAS and the European Union Alert (EU-Alert).

Users with CMAS capable UEs get warning alerts based on their specific location.

# 3 Feature Operation of Public Warning System

The Public Warning System feature has various configuration methods.

## 3.1 Configuration of ETWS and CMAS Common Parameters

The Paging.defaultPagingCycle parameter applies to both ETWS and CMAS.

The recommended value is 128, which is a paging cycle time of 1280 ms.

The EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength or

EUtranCellTDD.siWindowLength parameters also apply to both ETWS

and CMAS. The default value is 10 ms, and it is not advised to set the parameter to

less.

To reduce the risk of UEs not receiving the broadcast Public Warning Messages (SIB10,

SIB11, or SIB12), if measurement gaps occur at the same time, the SI messages are

transmitted twice in two different subframes within the same SI time window, as defined

in EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength or

EUtranCellTDD.siWindowLength. A 6-ms gap between the two

consecutive SI messages is enough for a UE to read at least one SI message when a

measurement gap occurs.

If the parameter is set to less than 10 ms when the Public Warning System feature is

enabled, an Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised with the

following additional text Possible some UEs do not receive broadcast

Public Warning Messages because SI window is too small.

If the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised, setting the

following parameters for SIB10, SIB11, and SIB12 is not possible:

- EUtranCellFDD.mappingInfo
- EUtranCellTDD.mappingInfo
- NbIotCell.mappingInfo Set these parameters before the EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength or EUtranCellTDD.siWindowLength parameter is changed.

Emergency Area ID List is one of the options in the Warning Area

List information element that defines the eNodeB cells where the received

notification is broadcast. The operator can assign up to 15 such IDs to a cell, which

means that the cell can belong to up to 15 (overlapping) emergency areas. If this option

is not used, this parameter does not have to be set.

For information on the maximum size of SIBs for the 1.4 MHz and 3-MHz bandwidths, see

Maximum Size of System Information Block Segments.

The PWS SIBs (SIB10, SIB11, and SIB12) must be mapped to unique SI messages. It is

recommended to configure PWS SIBs as the last SIs (after SIB19 and higher), as these are

broadcast only when there is active CMAS or ETWS notification pending in the system.

The eNodeB modifies the mapping of SIBs automatically and the MOM configuration does not

change if the following conditions apply:

- The EUtranCellFDD.sib1AltSchInfo or the EUtranCellTDD.sib1AltSchInfo attribute is set to true.
- PWS SIBs are mapped to the last SIs as recommended.
- SIB19 and higher are mapped to SIs without SIB18 and lower.
- SIB19 and higher are mapped after SIB18 and lower (except PWS SIBs), but before PWS SIBs as recommended.
- PWS SIBs are transmitted due to ongoing CMAS or ETWS broadcasts.

For more information on the mapping of SIBs, see Manage Radio Network LTE.

## 3.2 Configuration of ETWS Primary Notification Broadcast

The Paging.noOfDefPagCyclPrim parameter defines the length of time

SIB10 is broadcast in the RBS. It is expressed in the number of paging cycles. The

recommended value is 8. The assumed value of the parameter

Paging.defaultPagingCycle is 1.28 s. With the recommended value

of paging cycles and the assumed value for the parameter, it gives a broadcast time of

10 s.

The EUtranCellFDD.mappingInfoSIB10 or

EUtranCellTDD.mappingInfoSIB10 parameters  are used to configure

which SI message is to be used to carry SIB10. SIB10 must be mapped to a unique SI, to

which no other SIB is mapped. This unique SI is denoted SIx below.

The EUtranCellFDD.siPeriodicitySIx or

EUtranCellTDD.siPeriodicitySIx parameters define the periodicity

of the SIx message to which SIB10 is mapped. The recommended value is 8 radio frames (80

ms).

Figure 2 shows how SIB10 can be

broadcast. The default settings are used except for the

Paging.noOfDefPagCyclPrim parameter, where value 3 is used for

presentation.

Figure 2   Example of SIB10 Broadcast

The upper line in Figure 2 shows the

repetitions of SIB1. The inclusion of SIB10 in SIB1 is marked by the change to bold

bars. The next line shows the scheduling of SIB10 which is started at the same time as

inclusion of SIB10 in SIB1. The bottom line shows the paging cycles, the gray area

indicates that a Paging message is sent in every paging occasion. Paging is started when

SIB10 scheduling has started and is continued during the three following paging cycles.

The thin vertical lines on the horizontal line above the Paging line show the paging

cases for a particular UE. In its first paging case, paging has not yet started. In the

second case the UE reads the Paging message, then reads SIB1 and finally reads SIB10.

The UE receives two more Paging messages and then re-reads SIB1 and SIB10 in those

cases.

After the end of the third paging cycle with active paging, the last transmission

of SIB10 is done. SIB10 is then removed from SIB1. A final page is sent after SIB10

broadcast ends.

## 3.3 Configuration of ETWS Secondary Notification Broadcast

The EUtranCellFDD.mappingInfoSIB11 or

EUtranCellTDD.mappingInfoSIB11 parameters are used to configure

which SI message is to be used to carry SIB11. The secondary notification can be

segmented and sent in a sequence of up to 64 instances of SIB11. Each SIB11 carries one

segment and be broadcast in a separate instance of the SI used for SIB11.

SIB11 has to be mapped to a unique SI, that is an SI to which no other SIBs are mapped.

This unique SI is denoted SIx below.

The EUtranCellFDD.siPeriodicitySIx or

EUtranCellTDD.siPeriodicitySIx parameters  define the periodicity

of the SIx message to which SIB11 is mapped. The recommended value is 64 radio frames

(640 ms).

Figure 3 shows how SIB11 is broadcast

and repeated. Only one segment is assumed. The default settings are used except for

parameters EUtranCellFDD.siPeriodicitySIx or

EUtranCellTDD.siPeriodicitySIx where value 32 (320 ms) is used

for presentation.

Figure 3   Example of SIB11 Broadcast

Bold SIB1s here indicate that SIB11 is included in SIB1. Paging is sent during one full

paging cycle after the paging cycle in which it was started. Paging is not restarted

until the Repetition Period timer has expired or a new message is received. SIB11 are

broadcast until the requested number of broadcasts has been reached. The UE only reads

SIB11 once per Repetition Period. After the broadcast is finished, a final page is sent

during one paging cycle (not shown in Figure 3 above).

## 3.4 Configuration of Broadcast of CMAS Notifications

The EUtranCellFDD.mappingInfoSIB12 or

EUtranCellTDD.mappingInfoSIB12 parameters are used to configure

which SI message is to be used to carry the SIB12 information.

Each CMAS message can be segmented. Each SIB12 carries one segment and be

broadcast in a separate instance of the SI used for SIB12. These instances are broadcast

in sequence.

SIB12 must be mapped to a unique SI to which no other SIBs are mapped. This unique SI is

denoted SIx below.

The EUtranCellFDD.siPeriodicitySIx or

EUtranCellTDD.siPeriodicitySIx parameters define the periodicity

of the SIx message to which SIB12 is mapped. The recommended value is 64 radio frames

(640 ms).

Figure 4 shows how SIB12 may be

broadcast and repeated. Three CMAS messages are broadcast in sequence (white, gray, and

black), each with one segment, therefore three SI instances are repeated. The default

settings are used except for parameter siPeriodicitySIx where value

32 (320 ms) is used for presentation.

Figure 4   Example of SIB12 Broadcast

In Figure 4, the UE listens to the

Paging message with "cmas-Indication" set in its second paging case. When it starts to

read the SIB12 instances, it reads the gray SIB12 instance first. Then it reads the

black and then the white instance. The UE in the example reads the gray SIB12 instance

once more before it listens to its paging case.

If another CMAS message arrives while the Repetition Period timer is running, the new

message is added as a new SIB12 instance. The Repetition Period timer is restarted by

the insertion and removal of a SIB12 instance.

Two Repetition Periods are supported, with the condition that the longer period must be a

multiple of the shorter period. For example, if the first period used is 60 s, the

second period must be an integer fraction or integer multiple of the first period to be

accepted. In this example the following periods would be accepted: 1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 5 s, 6

s, 10 s, 12 s, 15 s, 20 s, 30 s, 120 s, 180 s and so on. If the second period received

does not fulfill this condition, it is mapped to the first period.

If two periods are already active and a third period is received, this one is mapped to

the nearest shorter period if any. For example, if the active periods are 60 s and 120

s, all received periods shorter than 120 s are mapped to the 60-s period and all periods

longer than 120 s are mapped to the 120-s period.

## 3.5 Maximum Size of System Information Block Segments

For DCI format 1A, the maximum size allowed by the physical layer is 277 bytes. For more

information, see 3GPP TS 36.212 Multiplexing and channel coding and

3GPP TS 36.213 Physical layer procedures. The maximum size for SIB11

(ETWS Secondary) and SIB12 (CMAS) message content is approximately 9600 bytes which are

broadcast in segments of 277 bytes (total segment length with ASN.1 load included).

The physical layer imposes a stricter limit on the maximum size of an SIB for bandwidths

1.4 MHz and 3 MHz. The parameters EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary42 or

EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary42 have default value 277.

To support transmission of ETWS or CMAS messages, or both, larger than 70 bytes on 1.4

MHz, EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary42 or

EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary42 must be set to 70 or lower.

To support transmission of ETWS or CMAS messages, or both, larger than 178 bytes on 3

MHz, EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary42 or

EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary42 must be set to 178 or lower.

## 3.6 PWS Restart Indication Procedure

The PWS Restart Indication

procedure is controlled through the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling

attribute. PWS restart handling is only applicable to MMEs with

the

value of the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute set to

ENABLED.

After an

eNodeB

restart or a complete S1 link failure, when no other S1

links with

the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute set to

ENABLED are available, the PWS warning

notifications, including

CMAS

and

ETWS

messages,

are handled in the following ways:

- The eNodeB stops broadcasting the PWS warning notifications.
- The PWS warning notifications are cleared off of the eNodeB.

This prevents the eNodeB from broadcasting expired and no longer desired PWS

warning notifications.

After the PWS warning notifications are cleared and a successful S1 setup procedure is

performed, the eNodeB sends the S1AP PWS RESTART INDICATION message to

the MME with the following information:

- The global eNodeB identity
- The cell global identity Note: Information on all configured LTE cells on an eNodeB is included except for NB-IoT cells.
- The tracking area identity

The S1AP PWS Restart

Indication message is sent to all available MMEs that have the

TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute set to

ENABLED.

When an S1 link with the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute

set to ENABLED is restored, the eNodeB stops sending the S1AP

PWS Restart Indication message if more than five seconds pass after cell

activation following an

eNodeB

restart or a

complete

S1 link failure.

When the MME receives the S1AP PWS RESTART INDICATION message, it relays

it to all the CBC servers to which it is connected. At reception, the CBC server

evaluates if the PWS warning notifications that the eNodeB could not broadcast are still

valid and need to be reloaded, or expired and no longer desired. Based on the evaluation

of the information received in the message, the CBC server proceeds as follows:

- If PWS warning notifications are still valid, they are reloaded and relayed to all cells or to specific cells of the affected eNodeB in a new S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message. The tracking area or the emergency area of the affected eNodeB specifies to which cells the PWS warning notifications are relayed.
- If the PWS warning notifications are expired and no longer desired, no action is taken.
- If a PWS warning notification is current, a new S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST is relayed to all cells or to specific cells of the impacted eNodeB. The tracking area or the emergency area of the impacted eNodeB specifies to which cells the PWS warning notifications are relayed.

In a MORAN on single Baseband Shared LTE RAN configuration, the S1AP PWS RESTART

INDICATION message is sent to each affected participating operator after the

following events:

- eNodeB restart
- Recovery from complete S1-C link failure for one or more MORAN on single Baseband participating operators

The S1AP PWS Restart

Indication message is sent to all available MMEs that have the

TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute set to

ENABLED for the affected participating operator in the MORAN on

single Baseband configuration.

When an S1 link with the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute

set to ENABLED is restored, the eNodeB stops sending the S1AP

PWS Restart Indication message if more than five seconds pass after cell

activation following an eNodeB restart or a complete S1 link failure.

In a MORAN on single Baseband Shared LTE RAN configuration, the eNodeB filters the cells

for message broadcast. The filtering is based on the participating operator core network

from which the S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message is received.

The eNodeB also filters the cells that must stop the CMAS notification broadcast. The

filtering is based on the MORAN on single Baseband participating operator core network

from which the S1AP KILL REQUEST message with the CMAS notification is

received.

In a MOCN or MOCN as MORAN

shared

LTE RAN configuration, the Public Warning System service is provided through a

single common CBC.

This

CBC handles all the cells with MOCN or MOCN as MORAN Shared LTE RAN configuration on

the eNodeB.

For more information on a common CBC for shared networks, see 3GPP TS

23.251.

## 3.7 Handling of Duplicated Write-Replace Warning Request Messages

The eNodeB differentiates between duplicate and non-duplicate S1AP

WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST messages based on the IEs in the

messages.

The purpose of the Write-Replace Warning procedure is to start or overwrite the broadcast

of warning messages.

The eNodeB can receive multiple S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST

messages with the same Message Identifier IE and Serial

Number IE. These messages are not treated as duplicates when one of the

following options is true:

- The Warning Area List IE is different.
- The Warning Area List IE is not present, but not all cells on the eNodeB are selected for broadcasting.

In these cases, a new warning message broadcast is initiated on the cells that are not

already broadcasting.

If all three IEs are identical, the eNodeB sends an S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING

RESPONSE message that includes the Broadcast Completed Area

List IE set according to the ongoing broadcast.

# 4 Network Impact of Public Warning System

The Public Warning System feature impacts downlink capacity, and affects memory and CPU

capacity if the persistent storage of warning messages is enabled.

Capacity and Performance

If the Public Warning System feature is activated, additional System Information

messages are broadcast on the DL-SCH, when warning messages received from the core

network are active in a cell. The impact on the downlink air interface capacity

depends on the operator selected periodicity of the system information messages and

on the repetition parameter settings for the warning message.

The approximate downlink air interface capacity loss is the following:

- 0.32% for FDD
- 0.52% for TDD (with the assumption of 6 subframes per radio frame)

If a cell in the eNodeB is not enabled at the time a notification is received, then

the notification is stored in the eNodeB. The broadcasting restarts if the cell is

enabled before the expiry of the validation time of the notification.

When a cell is disabled while broadcasting notifications, it stops sending

notifications. If the cell is enabled later and the validity time is not expired,

then it resume sending the notifications.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q3: CMAS Geofencing Information Support

This feature enhancement enables the eNodeB to receive CMAS geofencing information

from the MME, store the received information, and distribute it to the cells in the CMAS

broadcasting

area.

| Feature Name:           | Public Warning System              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 2050                       |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Support for CMAS Geofencing Information improves the accuracy of emergency alerts. The

enhancement enables the UE to compare its current position to the target area specified

by the geofencing information. This is achieved by sending the geographical area

coordinates of the target area to the UE. As a result, the UEs outside the target area

have the possibility to conditionally display the CMAS message.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

This change affects the following interfaces:

- RRC New IE is introduced in SIB12: warningAreaCoordinatesSegment-r15.
- S1AP New IE is introduced in the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message: Warning Area Coordinates.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- CBC The CBC must be compliant with 3GPP TS 29.168 15.1.0.
- Cell Broadcast Entity The Cell Broadcast Entity must be compliant with 3GPP TS 23.041 15.3.0.
- UE UEs must support 3GPP TS 36.331 15.3.0 on RRC.

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q3: PWS Restart Indication

The feature enhancement introduces the implementation of the PWS Restart Indication

procedure in the eNodeB.

| Feature Name:           | Public Warning System   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 2050            |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node     |
| Access Type:            | LTE                     |

Benefits

- The PWS Restart Indication procedure ensures that expired or no longer wanted PWS warning notifications (CMAS and ETWS messages) are not broadcast after a node restart or a complete S1 link failure.
- The eNodeB uses the PWS Restart Indication procedure to inform the CBC that it lost all PWS warning notifications and that it is now available to broadcast them again. The CBC resends the lost PWS warning notifications to all or specific cells on the given eNodeB if needed. Reloading PWS warning notifications is ensured even after planned longer outages (for example, when the eNodeB is powered down to prevent physical node damage).
- The eNodeB provides a 3GPP-compliant support with the implementation of the PWS Restart Indication procedure.

Capacity and Performance

No

impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following PM counter that gives information on

the number of PM events related to a node restart and a complete S1 link failure:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPwsRestartIndication
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPwsRestartIndication

The S1\_PWS\_RESTART\_INDICATION external PM event is introduced by

the feature enhancement to track when the eNodeB sends an S1AP PWS RESTART

INDICATION message to the MME over the S1-C

interface.

Interfaces

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

- ENM version 20.05 or later is required for this enhancement.
- SGSN-MME version 1.17 or later is required, if an Ericsson EPC is used for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.c: 23.Q1: Enhanced Public Warning System Observability

This feature enhancement introduces RBS PM counters for the observability of the

Public Warning System feature, replacing deprecated EBS PM counters.

| Feature Name           | Public Warning System   |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 2050            |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node     |
| Access Type            | LTE                     |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory               |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces

RBS

PM counters for the observability of the Public Warning System

feature, replacing nine equivalent EBS counters.

Serviceability is improved as the Public Warning System feature can be observed

through the introduced counters without the need of physical servers or the EBS-L

application.

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q1: Modified Duplicated Write-Replace Warning Request Message Handling

This feature enhancement modifies the process of handling duplicated

WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST messages.

| Feature Name           | Public Warning System   |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 2050            |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node     |
| Access Type            | LTE                     |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory               |

Summary and Benefits

The eNodeB can receive multiple WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST messages

with the same Message Identifier IE and Serial Number

IE. These messages are not treated as duplicates when one of the following options

is true:

- The Warning Area List IE is different.
- The Warning Area List IE is not present, but not all cells on the eNodeB are selected for broadcasting.

In these cases, a new warning message broadcast is initiated on the cells that are

not already broadcasting.

The benefit of this feature enhancement is that fewer WRITE-REPLACE WARNING

REQUEST messages are treated as duplicates, resulting in warning

messages being broadcast on the cells that are not already broadcasting.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Public Warning System

## Appendix A.e: 23.Q3: PWS Support for MORAN on Single Baseband

This feature enhancement updates Public Warning System feature processes to enable

support for the MORAN on single Baseband Shared LTE RAN configuration.

| Feature Name           | Public Warning System   | Shared LTE RAN      |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 2050            | FAJ 121 0860        |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package        | Shared Networks     |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400            | FAJ 801 0434        |

| Access Type            | LTE                     | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory               | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

The following Public Warning System feature processes are updated for all MORAN on

single Baseband participating operators:

- The eNodeB filters the cells for message broadcast based on the MORAN on single Baseband participating operator core network from which the S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message is received.
- The S1AP PWS RESTART INDICATION message is sent to all affected MORAN on single Baseband participating operators after eNodeB restart or recovery from complete S1-C link failure.
- When the MORAN on single Baseband configuration is used, the eNodeB filters the cells that must stop the CMAS notification broadcast. The filtering is based on the MORAN on single Baseband operator core network from which the S1AP KILL REQUEST message with the CMAS notification is received.

The benefit of this feature enhancement is that the updated Public Warning System

feature processes enable support for the MORAN on single Baseband Shared LTE RAN

configuration.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the

option

to control the PWS Restart Indication procedure in the eNodeB for specific MMEs.

The

procedure can be disabled for MMEs that are not connected to the CBC. The eNodeB

sends the S1AP Restart Indication message only

to

MMEs that have the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute

set to ENABLED.

Capacity and Performance

If the eNodeB is connected to more than two MMEs with

the

value of the

TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute set to

ENABLED, the number of S1AP PWS Restart

Indication messages increases. The number of sent S1AP PWS

Restart Indication messages can be observed with the following PM

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPwsRestartIndicationSent
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPwsRestartIndicationSent

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute to handle PWS

based on the network configuration. For MMEs in the network that are not connected

to the CBC,

the

value of the corresponding

TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute is recommended to

be set to DISABLED.

For MORAN on single Baseband configuration, the PWS functionality and related

messages are handled separately for each operator participating in the MORAN

configuration. If an operator has MMEs that are not connected to the CBC, the

TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling attribute is recommended to

be set to DISABLED for those MMEs.

When an S1 link with the TermPointToMme.pwsRestartHandling

attribute set to ENABLED is restored, the eNodeB stops sending the

S1AP PWS Restart Indication message if more than five seconds

pass after cell activation following

an

eNodeB

restart
