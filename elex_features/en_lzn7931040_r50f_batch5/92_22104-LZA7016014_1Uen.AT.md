# 1 A-GPS User Plane Location Support Overview

The A-GPS User Plane Location Support feature in the RBS enables the operator to keep

the location node updated. The geographic data of the cells served by the RBS.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0863                                  |
| Value Package Name:     | Location Support                              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                  |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                           |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each radio. |

Summary

The A-GPS method is the main positioning method to enable the operator to comply with the FCC

phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning of emergency calls. The accuracy of

the positioning method can vary between 20 and 50 meters.

Furthermore, it can serve as the positioning method for a wide variety of commercial services

which require high location accuracy.

# 2 Dependencies of A-GPS User Plane Location Support

This feature has only network requirements that has to be fulfilled for

activation.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

There are no limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- An E-SMLC is defined and available in the network.

# 3 Feature Operation of A-GPS User Plane Location Support

A-GPS User Plane Location Support feature keeps the geographical data of the cells

served by the RBS updated.

Operation Process

During the operation of the A-GPS User Plane Location Support in the RBS, whenever a

change occurs in any of the cell parameters, an update is sent to the location node.

The location node uses this cell data when compiling the assistance data sent to the

UE on the control plane bearer. The node also uses the data when it calculates the

UE positioning based on the GNSS measurements reported by the UE. The location node

in the user plane architecture is the SLP.

# 4 Network Impact of A-GPS User Plane Location Support

This feature has no impact on the

network.

# 6 Performance of A-GPS User Plane Location Support

This feature has no associated KPIs, counters and events.

KPIs

No impact.

Counters

No impact.

Events

No impact.

# 7 Activate A-GPS User Plane Location Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010963 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate A-GPS User Plane Location Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010963 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Privacy Functionality for A-GPS User Plane Location Support

This feature in the RBS enables the operator to keep the location node updated, through

the OSS, about the geographic data of the cells served by the RBS. An update is sent

whenever a change occurs in any of these cell parameters. The location node uses this

cell data when compiling the assistance data sent to the UE on the control plane bearer.

The node also uses the data when, for the UE assisted mode, it calculates the UE

positioning based on the GNSS measurements reported by the UE.

The UE's location information will be known. The A-GPS methods have a typical accuracy of

20-50 m. The UE forwards its position on the user plane to the positioning node upon

request.
