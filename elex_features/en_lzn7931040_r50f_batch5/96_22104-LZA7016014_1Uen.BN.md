Summary

Scheduling is an important functionality in the management of radio resources. The scheduler

makes decisions on allocating a certain part of the spectrum to a certain user,

based on several criteria.

In LTE, the radio link quality is not only dependent on variations over time, but

also variations within the frequencies of the transmission band. Such frequency

dependent variations introduce opportunities when performing uplink scheduling for a

UE transmission.

By using frequency-selective gain in uplink scheduling, that is, allocating high

channel quality resources to the UEs, both coverage and capacity is improved. The

Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature provides both significant cell edge

and average cell throughput improvements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature enables the uplink scheduler to

allocate resources based on the frequency-selective channel quality information.

Operational Process

The high level flow for scheduling, described in Scheduler, also applies when the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduler is

active. The exception is that the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduler is enabled to

allocate resources based on frequency-selective channel quality information.

Uplink frequency-selective scheduling means that the spectrum allocation for PUSCH

(Physical Uplink Shared Channel) transmissions is performed based on

frequency-dependent channel knowledge. The frequency awareness allows the scheduler

not only to prioritize which users to schedule during a certain time interval, but

to also decide which spectrum resources to be allocated each of these users. As

such, resource allocation decisions are made by taking both time and frequency

dimensions into account.

By performing uplink frequency-selective scheduling, the uplink scheduler attempts to

maximize the spectral efficiency. This is done through allocating each UE into a

part of the spectrum where the channel quality is good, according to certain

measurements, see Figure 1.

Figure 1   UE Allocation Based on Frequency Selective Channel Quality

Measurements

Sounding Reference Signals

The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature is dependent on sounding. Sounding

is a procedure which utilizes a set of uplink reference signals. Unlike the uplink

Demodulation Reference Signals (DMRS), which are sent within the same bandwidth as

the uplink signal, Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) can be sent over almost

arbitrary channel bandwidths. SRS provides the channel estimation over any part of

the spectrum. This gives the possibility of scheduling uplink transmission on

resource blocks of instantaneously good quality.

During SRS transmissions, frequency-selective uplink measurements of the signal power

are made. These power measurements are continuously be reported to the uplink

scheduler, which uses these measurements to estimate the frequency-selective uplink

gain of each UE. The estimated gain, together with the distribution of noise and

interference within the serving cell, is used by the uplink scheduler when

distributing PRB resources to the UEs targeted for scheduling.

FDD only: SRS transmissions are performed in the Single Carrier Frequency Division

Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) symbol next to DMRS, in subframes configured by the

eNodeB.

TDD only: SRS transmissions are performed in the Uplink Part of Time Slot (UpPTS)

part of the special subframe.

It is not recommended to enable SRS together with DRX of Ericsson VoLTE configuration

which has short DRX cycle, because there is possibility that SRS resource is not

aligned with the awake periods of DRX and can have a negative impact on the link

adaptation.

Allocation of SRS Resources

The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature enables the operator to select if

an SRS should be allocated or not per QCI.

The eNodeB only attempts to allocate an SRS resource to UEs that have at least one

Logical Channel Group (LCG) that triggers request for an SRS resource. An LCG

triggers request of an SRS resource when the Quality of Service Class Indicator

(QCI) of its highest priority configured logical channel is configured with the

parameter srsAllocationStrategy set to ACTIVATED. Thus, the

preference of a UE to request an SRS resource can change both when adding and when

removing a radio bearer. Example of SRS Resources Allocation shows an example of

SRS resource allocation.

Figure 2   Example of SRS Resources Allocation

PUSCH Resource Allocation

The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature enables to select either Frequency

Selective or Resource Fair resource allocation strategy for each QCI. The scheduler

does not take into account any frequency-selective channel quality information when

allocating resources if the

QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy attribute set

to RESOURCE\_FAIR. The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling only

applies with frequency-selective resource allocation strategy.

The scheduler applies frequency-selective resource allocation for PUSCH data

associated with an LCG whenever the QCI of the highest priority logical channel in

the LCG uses the QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy

attribute with the FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE setting. When applying

frequency-selective resource allocation for a UE that is allocated an SRS resource,

the scheduler uses measurements from SRS together with uplink DMRS and interference

measurements to allocate the UE to the frequencies with the most favorable signal

quality.

When applying frequency-selective resource allocation for UEs that are not allocated

an SRS resource, the scheduler bases the scheduling decision on frequency averaged

measurements from the uplink DMRS. However, the scheduler is taking

frequency-selectivity in interference measurements into account.

Interoperability with Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature is mutually operable with Flexible Channel Bandwidth, using wideband SRS.

The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature limits the area of scheduled

resources based on Flexible Channel Bandwidth configuration. Measurement acquisition

of channel metrics for each scheduled sub-band is determined by wideband SRS

measurements.

## 3.1 DMRS-Based Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling for Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

For cells with range beyond 100 km, the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature

can only be used with DMRS-based channel quality estimation in all zones.

The channel quality estimation method that differentiates subbands in frequency domain

supports frequency-selective scheduling. The required configuration of SRS for uplink

frequency-selective scheduling is not recommended for long range cells because it

results in overall degradation for all zones. In this case, the

EUtranCellFDD.ulSrsEnable attribute must be set to

false and DMRS in PUSCH reception can be used for subband channel

estimation.

The DMRS-based uplink frequency-selective scheduling can be provided for all zones in

long range cells if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km feature is activated.
- The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature is enabled.
- Any of the UE active bearers has a QCI profile with the QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy attribute set to FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE.
- Available DMRS resources are provided.

DMRS resources control memory consumption by limiting the maximum number of UEs that can

use subband PUSCH channel estimation. The conditions are evaluated at each activation of

a new bearer or a new SCell. After the resource is assigned, the pool of the remaining

DMRS resources is reduced by one on both cell and node level.

For DMRS-based channel estimation, the following resources can be available:

- The maximum number of DMRS users for a cell can amount up to 100.
- The maximum number of DMRS users for a Baseband unit can amount up to 505 depending on hardware.

If the maximum number of DMRS users is exceeded, the average channel quality

estimation is used.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

Configuration

Uplink frequency-selective scheduling is enabled or disabled for each QCI by setting

the values of the attributes in the

QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy and

QciProfilePredefined.srsAllocationStrategy MOs.

By default, the feature is turned off for QCIs, that is, the value of

QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy is set to

RESOURCE\_FAIR and the value of

QciProfilePredefined.srsAllocationStrategy is set to

DEACTIVATED. The value of the

EUtranCellFDD.ulSrsEnable or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulSrsEnable attribute is by default set to

false.

Uplink frequency-selective scheduling is activated for a certain bearer type by

setting the QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy

attribute to FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE. The

QciProfilePredefined.srsAllocationStrategy attribute must be

set to ACTIVATED and the

EUtranCellFDD.ulSrsEnable or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulSrsEnable must be set to

true for the eNodeB to make an attempt to allocate a sounding

resource.

Setting QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy and

QciProfilePredefined.srsAllocationStrategy to other than the

default values only takes effect if the feature states of the Uplink

Frequency-Selective Scheduling and QoS-Aware Scheduler features are ENABLED. Setting

the value of EUtranCellFDD.ulSrsEnable and

EUtranCellTDD.ulSrsEnable to other than its default value

takes effect only if the service state of the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

feature is ENABLED.
