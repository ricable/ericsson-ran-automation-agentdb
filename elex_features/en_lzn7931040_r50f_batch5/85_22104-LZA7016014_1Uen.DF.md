(1)

Only valid for a Combined Cell with a maximum of

2TX/2RX.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The radio configurations compatible with a combined cell are described in Radio Node Configurations.

Combined Cell can support 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz, and 20 MHz bandwidth. 5 MHz

bandwidth can be configured for 4.6 MHz or 4.8 MHz. Selected radios can be found in

Radio Node Configurations.

All sector carriers within a combined cell must have the same number of antennas both

in the downlink and uplink directions. The number of downlink and uplink antennas

can differ within the same sector carrier. A sector carrier with some or all of its

antennas disabled is degraded or disabled, respectively, and it is not included in

the combined cell.

If some antennas belonging to a sector carrier that is included in a combined cell

are disabled, the system initiates automatic cell lock and unlock to exclude the

affected sector carrier from the combined cell. Cell lock and unlock results in a

short-term cell outage.

If all antennas belonging to a sector carrier that is initially excluded from a

combined cell are enabled, the system initiates automatic cell lock and unlock to

add the affected sector carrier to the combined cell. Cell lock and unlock results

in short-term cell outage.

A given sector carrier can only be connected to one combined cell, it is not a

feasible configuration to connect it to multiple combined cells.

The delay difference between sector carriers within a combined cell must be less than

50 µs, which corresponds to a maximum distance of 10 km (pure fiber length).

Otherwise, the cell is not enabled, and the Resource Configuration

Failure alarm is raised. To cease the alarm and to enable the

combined cell, the difference in fiber length must be less than 10 km. This also

means that the values of the RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay and the

RfBranch.ulTrafficDelay MOs cannot differ more than 50000

between the different sector carriers within the same cell.

To benefit from the macrodiversity on the PUSCH and PDSCH data channel, the sector

carriers must not be placed more than 1500 m apart.

Heterogeneous network deployment can be configured in conjunction with the Combined

Cell feature. However, possible unequal sector powers at different radio types are

not taken into account in the downlink sector selection.

Downlink interference mitigation is not performed for the secondary cell when using

the Carrier Aggregation feature together with the Combined Cell feature, since all

sectors of the secondary cell are used for the downlink data transmission in the

combined cell.

The following configurations are supported for Baseband radio node only:

- Combined cell with 9-12 sectors with 2TX/2RX antennas in each sector
- Combined cell with up to six sectors with 4TX/4RX antennas in each sector

NB-IoT coexistence with standalone deployment mode is not supported.

The Combined Cell feature with in-band or guard band

deployment modes NB-IoT coexistence has the following limitations:

- NB-IoT coexistence with an LTE combined cell is only supported for NB-IoT in-band and guard band deployment modes.
- The host LTE cell must be configured with two sector carriers with 2TX/ 2RX. No other antenna combinations are supported.
- By default, without manual configuration, the first sector carrier of the host LTE combined cell is used for the hosted NB-IoT cell. Manual configuration is available in one of the sector carriers of the host LTE combined cell.

If two Radio Gateway units are used, the EUtranCellTDD MO or

EUtranCellFDD MO must have its

SectorCarrier MOs allocated to Radio units that are connected

to the same Radio Gateway. The Inconsistent

Configuration alarm is raised if the Combined Cell is allocated

to both Radio Gateways.

Network Requirements

Regarding the supported LTE combined cell configurations, see details in Features for Radio Configurations.

# 3 Feature Operation of Combined Cell

The Combined Cell feature allows multiple sector carriers to belong to the same

cell.

The sector carriers can either be located indoors or outdoors. However, all sector carriers

that are present in the same cell are considered as one logical cell with the same PCI. Figure 1 provides an overview of the feature concept.

Figure 1   Overview Concept of the Combined Cell Feature

In a combined cell, multiple sector carriers can serve the same cell. The individual radios

within a combined cell can have different output power setting configurations. In a combined

cell, all radios are connected to the same Baseband Unit, however the different

output power is not considered for the sector evaluation.

The Combined Cell feature supports uplink and downlink sector carrier selection within the

same cell. In downlink, the feature supports selective muting of non-contributing sector

carriers for the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), to reduce interference in

neighboring cells. In uplink, if the UE is in an overlapping coverage area, the feature

supports macrodiversity on the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) to improve the uplink

transmissions.

The initial sector carrier selection for a UE is computed from

the relative powers of the random access preambles received at the

different sector carriers. After that, the received Physical Uplink

Control Channel (PUCCH) Format 2 power measurements are used by the

eNodeB to determine the transmission and reception sector carriers

required for each UE.

## 3.1 Combination of Indoor and Outdoor Coverage

Figure 2 provides an example of the use of the

Combined Cell feature to improve radio performance in a combination of indoor and outdoor

environments. Multiple sector carriers of the same combined cell are used to provide coverage

inside the building and macro coverage outside the building.

Figure 2   Example of Using Combined Cells in a Combination of Indoor

and Outdoor Coverage Environments

The benefits of using the Combined Cell feature in this scenario

are:

- Seamless mobility on entering and leaving the building.
- In coverage overlaps between sector carriers belonging to the same cell, an improved bit rate for a single UE can be expected compared to a single cell with a UE at cell border. The overlapping sector carriers provide a macrodiversity in this region.

## 3.2 Indoor Coverage

Figure 3 shows an example of the use

of the Combined Cell feature to improve radio performance in an indoor

environment. Multiple sector carriers of the same combined cell are

used to provide indoor coverage to multiple floors of the same building.

Figure 3   Example of Using Combined Cells in an Indoor Coverage Environment

The benefits of using the Combined Cell feature in this scenario

are:

- Seamless mobility between the floors of the building covered by the same combined cell.
- In coverage overlaps between sector carriers belonging to the same cell, an improved bit rate for a single UE can be expected compared to a single cell with a UE at cell border. The overlapping sector carriers provide a macrodiversity in this region.

## 3.3 NB-IoT Cell Coexistence with LTE Combined Cell

An in-band or guard band NB-IoT cell can exist in one sector of an LTE combined

cell.

Only a combined cell with 2TX/2RX antenna configuration supports NB-IoT cell

coexistence.

An LTE combined cell with two sector carriers can have an in-band or guard band NB-IoT

cell configured. The NB-IoT cell only uses one of the sector carriers of the host LTE

combined cell. The default value of NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef is set

to the first sector carrier of the host LTE combined cell. It is possible to manually

set the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef to another cell. The attribute can

only be set to one of the sector carriers of the host LTE combined cell.

### 3.3.1 Configure Sector Carrier of In-Band NB-IoT Cell

For the initial manual configuration, or the change of configuration of the sector

carrier of the in-band NB-IoT cell:

Steps

1. Lock the in-band cell.
2. Lock the host cell.
3. Set the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute to one of the elements of the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef list of the host cell.
4. Unlock the host cell.
5. Unlock the in-band cell.

### 3.3.2 Configure Sector Carrier of Guard Band NB-IoT Cell

For the initial manual configuration, or the change of configuration of the sector

carrier of the guard band NB-IoT cell:

Steps

1. Lock the guard band cell.
2. Lock the host cell.
3. Set the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute to one of the elements of the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef list of the host cell.
4. Unlock the host cell.
5. Unlock the guard band cell.

### 3.3.3 Validate Sector Carrier Configuration of Host LTE Cell

When the configuration of the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef

attribute changes, it must be validated that the sector carriers for the LTE cell

contain the sector carrier for the NB-IoT in-band or guard band cell.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute. If the validation is successful, the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute is set successfully.

If validation fails, the following message is displayed: At least one

sector attached to NB-IoT cell &lt;NbIotCell.cellId&gt; is not

attached to the host cell

&lt;EUtranCellFDD.cellId&gt;!

&lt;NbIotCell.cellId&gt; refers to the cell ID of the NB-IoT cell.

&lt;EUtranCellFDD.cellId&gt; refers to the cell ID of the host LTE

cell.

Continue with the following steps:

2. Remove the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute again and repeat the procedure until validation is successful.

# 4 Network Impact of Combined Cell

The feature improves coverage and mobility.

Capacity and Performance

The Combined Cell feature extends the indoor and outdoor coverage areas within the same

cell. The cell capacity of the combined cell is not impacted. A combined cell has the same

capacity as a cell that is not combined.

No neighbor relations need to be established between sector carriers of the same combined

cell. This enables a reduction in the number of handovers.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Combined Cell

The feature introduces new and uses already existing MOM attributes.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Combined Cell

Engineering guidelines for Combined Cell contain hardware configuration examples and

feature optimization.

## 9.1 Feature Optimization

Power measurements on PUCCH Format 2 containing CQI reports are needed to perform sector

selection. Therefore, it is recommended that the value of

EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers and

EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers are set to no less than

EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers and

EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers to fully benefit from the Combined Cell

feature.

For those UEs that cannot be configured with PUCCH Format 2 resources, that is PUCCH CQI, the

sector selection is only performed at Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). These UEs are

not updated until the next random access procedure, due to the lack of PUCCH Format 2 power

measurements.

## 9.2 Hardware Configurations

A given sector carrier can only be connected to one combined cell, it is not a possible

configuration to connect it to multiple Combined Cells.

Examples of hardware configurations using the Combined Cell feature are provided in the

following illustrations:

- Figure 4
- Figure 5
- Figure 6
- Figure 7
- Figure 8
- Figure 9
- Figure 10

Figure 4 provides an example configuration of one

combined cell with eight sector carriers, 2TX/2RX, cascaded radios.

Figure 4   One Combined Cell with Eight Sector Carriers, 2TX/2RX, Cascaded Radios

Figure 5 provides an example configuration of one

combined cell with eight sector carriers, 2TX/2RX, mixed configuration cascaded radios.

Figure 5   One Combined Cell with Eight Sector Carriers, 2TX/2RX, Mixed Configuration Cascaded

Radios

Figure 6 shows an example configuration between two combined cells, one with

three sector carriers 2TX/RX, and one with four sectors 4TX/4RX, with cascaded radios.

Figure 6   Two Combined Cells with Different Configurations

Figure 7 shows an example configuration of one

combined cell with 12 sector carriers, 2TX/2RX, cascaded radios.

Figure 7   One Combined Cell with 12 Sector Carriers, 2TX/2RX, Cascaded Radios

Figure 8 shows an example configuration of one

combined cell with six sector carriers, 4TX/4RX.

Figure 8   One Combined Cell with Six Sector Carriers, 4TX/4RX

Figure 9   One Radio Gateway and a Combined Cell with Six Sector Carriers

Figure 10   One LC-05 9xCPRI Line Card in Conversion Mode and a Combined Cell with Six Sector

Carriers

An EUtranCell which has multiple sector carriers must have all sector carriers on RUs that

are connected to the same Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card in conversion mode.

see Features for Radio Configurations.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: Combined Cell with 24 Antennas

The enhancement enables combined cell support for up to 12 sectors and 24 antennas on

Baseband Radio Nodes.

| Feature Name:           | Combined Cell       |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3025        |
| Value Package Name:     | Combined Cell       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0407        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Benefits

This feature enhancement provides support for 24 antenna branches and for the

following sector configurations:

- Up to 12 sectors with two RX and two TX antennas
- Up to six sectors with four RX and four TX antennas

The main benefits of this enhancement are the extended flexibility of combined cell

configuration, and the reduced cell planning.

Capacity and Performance

Cell coverage is extended because of the greater number of sectors.

The number of inter-cell handovers decreases because of the extended coverage.

Cell capacity is unaffected, but because more sectors share the same capacity, the

mean sector capacity decreases.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q2: Coexistence of NB-IoT and Combined Cell

This enhancement supports the use of NB-IoT in one dedicated cell that is involved in

LTE Combined Cell deployment.

| Feature Name:           | Combined Cell  NB-IoT Access                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3025  FAJ 121 4657                   |
| Value Package Name:     | Combined Cell  M-IoT RAN on LTE Base Package |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0407  FAJ 801 1000                   |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Access Type:            | LTE  MI                                      |

Benefits

An NB-IoT cell can be configured in in-band or guard band deployment mode for an LTE

combined cell and carry the same benefits as an LTE combined cell. Only a combined

cell with 2TX/2RX antenna configuration supports NB-IoT cell coexistence. The NB-IoT

cell only uses one of the sector carriers of the host LTE combined cell.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The sector carrier used in the NB-IoT cell is configured statically by MOM.

The NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute is updated. It is

applicable to all deployments.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.c: 19.Q1: Combined Cell with Extended Configuration

The enhancement enables Combined Cell at Baseband sites with four Tx and four Rx

antennas, with a maximum of four

sectors.

| Feature Name:           | Combined Cell       |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3025        |
| Value Package Name:     | Combined Cell       |

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Up to four Rx and four Tx antennas can be set up for each sector in a combined cell. The

extended configuration is supported in both FDD and TDD modes.

The improvement enables Combined Cell to be deployed in a wider range of site

configurations.
