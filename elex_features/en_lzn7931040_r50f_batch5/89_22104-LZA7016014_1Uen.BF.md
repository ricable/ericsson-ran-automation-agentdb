# 1 Advanced Cell Supervision Overview

With the Advanced Cell Supervision feature, the operator can get information

immediately when sleeping cells are suspected. Optionally, a recovery action is started to

try to automatically correct a suspected sleeping cell.

Summary

A cell is regarded as non-operational if UEs cannot connect, reconnect, or handover

to the cell when otherwise it is able to. Cells that are non-operational and are not

detected by normal fault management functions on the node are called sleeping

cells.

An incorrect configuration of the Advanced Cell Supervision profile can cause false

alarms. The following PM statistics and PM events are used to determine if a cell

with an Advanced Cell Supervision service alarm is actually sleeping, or if the

configured Advanced Cell Supervision profile is incorrect.

The Advanced Cell Supervision feature provides the operator with information

immediately when sleeping cells are suspected.

Optionally, a recovery action is started to try to automatically correct a suspected

sleeping cell. Self-healing is supported by automatically trying to recover the

suspected sleeping cell. If the recovery action is successful, no alarm is sent.

If the recovery action fails, the Suspected Sleeping Cell alarm is issued.

# 3 Feature Operation of Advanced Cell Supervision

The feature is implemented in the eNodeB and it defines a number of different

mechanisms to detect suspected sleeping cells. The mechanisms that detect suspected sleeping

cells are called detectors.

Figure 1   Advanced Cell Supervision Feature Overview

The Advanced Cell Supervision steps are:

1. The detectors check local events generated in the eNodeB.
2. The local events are analyzed by the detectors which are independent of each other.
3. Optionally, a recovery action automatically takes place if any of the detectors suspect a sleeping cell. No alarm is sent if the recovery action is successful but if it fails an alarm is sent. If no recovery action is configured, an alarm is sent directly when a sleeping cell is suspected .

Operational Sequence Diagram

Figure 2   Advanced Cell Supervision Flowchart

The feature operates the following way:

1. When started, the various detectors in the feature periodically check if a sleeping cell is suspected.
2. If a sleeping cell is suspected, the feature checks if any automatic recovery action is required.
3. If automatic recovery action is required, the cell lock and unlock recovery action is implemented.
4. No alarm notification is sent if the recovery action is successful.
5. An alarm raise notification is sent if no recovery action is required or if the recovery action is not successful. The alarm is located on the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MOC.
6. The raised alarm ceases when all detectors stop suspecting sleeping cells.

## 3.1 Detector Description

The detectors used in Advanced Cell Supervision identify typical situations for sleeping cell

situations. The focus is to identify abnormal behavior in the UE setup sequence.

The thresholds and the measurement periods used in the detectors are configured depending on

how the sensitivity parameter is set.

Figure 3   Detector Coverage in Setup

Sequence

The following list shows how the various detectors suspect sleeping

cells:

| Detector 1   |    | Suspects a sleeping cell if a certain number of random access preamble attempts (RA Msg             1) divided by the average number of RRC connected UEs are detected during a measurement             period but there is no detection of successful RRC connection setup, incoming handovers             or user-plane traffic.   |

# 4 Network Impact of Advanced Cell Supervision

The Advanced Cell Supervision feature improves availability since the operator will be

informed earlier about suspected sleeping cells.

Capacity and Performance

Compared to existing solutions, this feature improves availability because the operator is

informed earlier about suspected sleeping cells. Due to the automatic recovery action, the

feature also tries to self-heal, if a sleeping cell is suspected.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Advanced Cell Supervision

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Advanced Cell Supervision

A certain traffic load must exist in order to use a certain sensitivity

value.

Table 5 describes the

traffic load that must exist to use a certain sensitivity value.

The rows in the table correspond to different sensitivity values. The columns describe

the thresholds and measurement periods used by the different detectors at a particular

sensitivity level. Thresholds are detector specific conditions, that occur in a

predefined number of times during the measurement period. The number of times a

condition has to occur is specified in the table with the corresponding measurement

period. For detector 5 the thresholds are only defined as measurement periods.

Table 5   Guide to Sensitivity Parameter Setting Based on Traffic Load

|   Sensitivity Parameter Value | Detector 1 Threshold   | Detector 2 Threshold   | Detector 3 Threshold   | Detector 4 Threshold   | Detector 5 Threshold   |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
|                             0 | N/A                    | 5 in 15 min            | N/A                    | 3 in 15 min            | N/A                    |
|                            25 | N/A                    | 5 in 15 min            | 10 in 15 min           | 2 in 10 min            | 24 hrs                 |
|                            50 | 2 in 15 min            | 5 in 15 min            | 15 in 15 min           | 2 in 10 min            | 5 hrs                  |
|                            75 | 5 in 10 min            | 4 in 10 min            | 15in 10 min            | 2 in 5 min             | 60 min                 |
|                           100 | 7 in 5 min             | 2 in 5 min             | 10 in 5 min            | 2 in 5 min             | 5 min                  |

The following sensitivity parameter values are used in the detectors to define the

thresholds:

- 0
- 25
- 50
- 75
- 100

If any values between the ones listed are selected, linear interpolation is used by the

system to calculate which thresholds to use.

If a sensitivity value half-way between 50 and 75 is selected, such as 62 or 63, the

time period for detector 5 threshold is 3 hours, which is half-way between 5 hours and

60 minutes.

In certain cases, one or more detectors are not used for certain sensitivity parameter

values. These are marked Not Applicable (N/A) in Table 5. If an intermediate sensitivity

parameter value is chosen, between one where a certain detector is not used and one

where a detector is used, that detector will not be used.

To avoid false alarms, start with a low sensitivity level and then gradually increase it

until detection of suspected sleeping cells is quick enough without causing false alarms

to trigger.

If the traffic load in a cell matches different sensitivity values in Table 5, the line with the lowest

sensitivity value is selected to avoid false alarms.

Example 1

Assume the traffic load in a cell is normally always above sensitivity level 75 for

detector A and above sensitivity 50 for detector B. In these cases, sensitivity 50

must be selected because selecting 75 causes detector B to create false alarms. In

this example, detector A and B correspond to any of the detectors 1-5 in Table 5.

## 9.1 Suspected Sleeping Cell Alarm

When a sleeping cell is suspected, an automatic recovery is performed, if configured by the

operator.

When a recovery action is performed, that action is evaluated after a certain time to check

if the recovery was successful or not. The time until the evaluation corresponds to the

longest measurement period used by all detectors in the cell. For example, if the measurement

period for detectors 1, 2, and 3 is 15 minutes, detector 4 uses 10 minutes, and detector 5

uses 5 hours, then the evaluation period is 5 hours.

A timer is used to prevent recovery actions from being performed too often. The timer is set

to 24 hours. This means that if a sleeping cell is suspected within 24 hours after a

successful or failed recovery attempt, no new recovery is attempted. Instead an alarm is

immediately raised. The additionalText in that alarm contains information

about the attempted additional recovery action, including the result.

An alarm raise notification is sent if no recovery action is configured after suspecting a

sleeping cell, or if the recovery action failed. The alarm is directed to the Managed Object

cell suspected to be sleeping.

The specific problem is Suspected Sleeping Cell.

The additionalText alarm attribute contains information about the

situation during which the alarm is raised.

| recov failed            | Suspicion of the sleeping cell remains after the automatic recovery action.                                |
| recov succ              | A sleeping cell is suspected for less than 24 hours and the recovery action is                 successful. |

The alarm ceases when the cell is no longer suspected to be sleeping.

## 9.2 Activate Advanced Cell Supervision Data Collection Function

The Advanced Cell Supervision data collection functionality collects troubleshooting

data automatically when first symptoms of sleeping cells occur.  The information increases

the chances of successful troubleshooting root cause of sleeping cells.

While optional features need to be activated, basic features are activated

automatically during node integration. The operator can however deactivate Advanced

Cell Supervision data collection. Data is stored on Radio Node's flash drive where

it will be waited to be included in next ESI data package.

Prerequisites

- Advanced Cell Supervision is activated.

Steps

1. Set the value of the sleepCellDataCollect MO attribute to COLLECTION\_ENABLED.

## 9.3 Deactivate Advanced Cell Supervision Data Collection Function

If the functionality is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

functionality deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of

any conflicting function.

Steps

1. Set the value of the sleepCellDataCollect MO attribute to COLLECTION\_DISABLED.
