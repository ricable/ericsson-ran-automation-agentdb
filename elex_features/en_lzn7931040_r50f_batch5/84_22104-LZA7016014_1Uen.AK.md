Summary

IRC is a method for antenna combining and is superior to MRC when suppressing received

signals. IRC uses correlations in the spatial domain (between antennas) and in the

frequency domain to suppress interfering signals from other cells or in-band

external interference.

The use of IRC on uplink channels does not require any additional UE support.

IRC improves false detection and missed detection performance on the PRACH in an inter-cell

interference scenario. IRC is always available on the PRACH.

Hardware

Before feature activation, at least two receive antennas must be installed for the

cells on the RBS. If it is a TDD cell, up to eight receive antennas can be

installed.

This feature is not supported on AIR 6454 units.

This feature is supported on AIR 3284 unit.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Interference Rejection Combining

The feature enables the operator to improve the suppression of inter-cell

interference.

The Interference Rejection Combining feature is a form of antenna combining that is

superior to MRC in interference-limited systems. When the feature is enabled, the RBS

uses the Interference Rejection Combining feature instead of MRC in interference limited

situations.

There is an eight-way receiver IRC solution for PUCCH, PUSCH and PRACH. Large capacity

and coverage improvements are expected when going from two-way receiver to eight-way

receiver diversity.

Interference Suppression

Figure 1 shows how the Interference

Rejection Combining feature can be used in the antenna combiner rather than MRC to

improve interference suppression.

Figure 1   IRC as Antenna Combiner

The Interference Rejection Combining feature maximizes the SINR of the combined

signal by minimizing the noise and interference at the antenna combiner output while

preserving the signal. It can be seen as weighting down the signal in the directions

of the interferers, so that they do not corrupt the signal from the user.

# 4 Network Impact of Interference Rejection Combining

The feature can increase the uplink capacity of the system.

Capacity and Performance

The Interference Rejection Combining feature can increase the coverage of active UEs

in uplink, in interference-limited environments.

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.
