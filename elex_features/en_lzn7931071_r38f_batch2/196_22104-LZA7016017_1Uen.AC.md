Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- Only Mid-Band is supported by this feature.
- The SSB and TRS periodicity must be at least 20 ms.
- The CSI-RS periodicity must be at least 20 ms.
- The NR cells must have the same BFN offset.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band

The feature can be enabled with an attribute and the SSB index is either allocated

based on mod 3 or configured using an attribute.

To reduce interference from neighbor cells and increase SSB SINR, the feature uses a

different SSB time index that is allocated automatically based on mod 3 or configured

through the NRCellDU.ssbIndex attribute.

If the license is activated and the NRCellDU.ssbTimeShiftEnabled

attribute is set to true, then the SSB time shift starts and the cell

updates every connected signal.

Automatic SSB Index Allocation

If

the

value of the NRCellDU.ssbIndex attribute is not configured, the

NRCellDU.ssbIndexAutoSelected attribute is created

automatically, and the SSB index is calculated from PCI with the following

equation:

One cell has only one SSB index, and three SSB indexes are used in a network, as seen

in Figure 1.

To reduce interference from neighbor cells, it is recommended to deploy PCI with mod

3.

Figure 1 shows the three time

shifted SSB indexes and how they are distributed in a network.

Figure 1   Three Time Shifted SSB Indexes and their Distribution

SSB Index Configuration

If the NRCellDU.ssbIndex attribute is set to a non-empty value,

the associated cell uses this value as the SSB index.

# 4 Network Impact of NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band

The feature can increase coverage and SSB decoding success rate.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves SS-SINR. The improved SS-SINR allows more UEs to start the

random access procedure in poor radio conditions. However, the random access

procedure for these UEs are more likely to fail, or these UEs are more likely to

have radio link failures.

As the number of slots used by common search space (CSS) is reduced when the feature

is enabled, the success rate of Msg2 can decrease.

It is strongly recommended to enable the NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band feature in all

cells on the same frequency to achieve the full feature gain.

CSS opportunity is decreased on some downlink slots to reduce interference from

neighbor cell SSBs and SIB1s. This prolongs the time needed to complete the random

access procedure when SSB time shift is enabled.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band
