Hardware

The feature is supported for all RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4 and above,

except for RAN Compute group 5e.

Limitations

The feature is only supported in the following deployments:

- Low-Band FDD
- Low-Band TDD
- Mid-Band TDD

For more information, see Baseband 24.Q4 Parameter and Counter Limitations for

NR.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Flexible Downlink Resource Allocation Type Low/Mid-Band

This feature enables the configuration of UEs with static resource allocation type

1.

When UEs are configured for resource allocation type 1 in downlink, PDSCH

resources are allocated to one or more consecutive resource blocks.

Even if Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resources are assigned to the UE, transmissions

that are smaller than one RBG only use codebook-based beamforming.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The gNodeB determines if the cell supports both resource allocation types. If the cell supports only one allocation type, the gNodeB configures the UE with the allocation type supported by the cell. Otherwise, the gNodeB determines the required type of configuration.
3. For RRC setup, the gNodeB configures the UE with resource allocation type 0. For RRC reconfiguration or RRC resume, the gNodeB determines if the feature is activated in the cell.
4. Depending on whether the feature is activated, the gNodeB can configure the UE the following ways:
    - If the feature is not activated, the gNodeB configures the UE with resource allocation type 0.
    - If the feature is activated and the cell is an SCell, the gNodeB configures the UE with resource allocation type 0.
    - If the feature is activated and the cell is an SpCell, the gNodeB configures the UE according to the UE group.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Flexible Downlink Resource Allocation Type Low/Mid-Band

The feature can improve spectral efficiency.

Capacity and Performance

The feature can reduce the number of padding bits and can improve spectral

efficiency.

When resource allocation type 1 is employed and MCS reduction is enabled,

transmission robustness can be reduced and handover interruption time can be

affected, resulting in higher BLER. Handover interruption time increase measures the

time between the RRC Reconfiguration and RRC

ReconfigurationComplete message transmissions. With resource allocation

type 1 DCI 1\_1 format transmissions, there is a higher NACK rate for RRC

Reconfiguration messages. The messages require retransmission, resulting

in higher BLER and increased handover interruption time. This is expected behavior

because of the trade-off between low BLER and increased spectrum efficiency.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| Average Number of Active Ues in DL                          | The RI can decrease if the number of PDSCH scheduled entities for                                     each slot increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Distribution of Number of PDSCH Scheduled Entities Per Slot | The RI can increase depending on the traffic pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| DL RBSym Utilization / DL RBSym Utilization Distribution    | The RI can decrease depending on traffic and whether resource                                     allocation type 0 UEs are present. Resource allocation type 1                                     schedules with PRB granularity instead of RBG granularity, which                                     results in reduced PRB occupancy. |

For more information on RIs, see License and Resource Use Indicators.

Counters

The feature introduces the following PM counters related to HARQ transmission

scheduling types:

- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlResAllocType0Dci11
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlResAllocType1Dci11

The following PM counters can be used to observe the performance of the feature:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschTypeA
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschTypeB
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbLastSlot
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbSingleBurst
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurst
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbOverlapLastSlot

When resource allocation type 1 is enabled, the value of the

NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl attribute decreases because of the lower

number of PRBs with padding.

Depending on traffic, the the following PM counters related to energy measurement

might be used to observe the performance of the feature:

- ConsumedEnergyMeasurement.pmConsumedEnergy
- ConsumedEnergyMeasurement.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated
- ConsumedEnergyMeasurement.pmPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeasurement.pmAccumulatedEnergyConsumption
- EnergyMeasurement.pmEnergyConsumption
- EnergyMeasurement.pmPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergy
- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated
- EnergyMeter.pmPowerConsumption
