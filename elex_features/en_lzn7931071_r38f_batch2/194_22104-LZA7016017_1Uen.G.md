| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature allows the barring of UEs from accessing the network or from setting up

new services for connected UEs. If barring is active, the barring probability can

span between 5% and 100%.

The barring probability can be configured on cell level. It is possible to configure

individual barring policies based on the followings:

- The access category of the access attempt
- The access identity of the access attempt
- The PLMN

The barring probability can be configured to be constant or dependent on the

following cell usage measures:

- The ratio of connection attempt rejections in the cell
- The number of connected UEs in the cell

Benefits

This feature has the following benefits:

- It helps to protect the gNodeB from an overload. The feature offloads the air interface and helps the gNodeB load control functions to properly handle the high load conditions by reducing the intensity of connection attempts.
- It enables access prioritization for certain users and services. The feature enables the prioritization of access for specific groups of users and services by differentiating the barring directives between different access categories, access identities, and PLMNs under high load conditions.Note: Users that run mission-critical traffic cannot be barred unless the NR Unified Access Control for Mission-Critical Services feature is activated.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Unified Access Control

The feature has dependencies to load control functions.

Interaction with Load Control Functions

Feature Operation of NR Unified Access Control

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Unified Access Control

The feature allows the gNodeB to bar user access and service requests, considering

factors such as the load in the cell, the requested service, the user type, and the

PLMN.

Operational Process

Figure 1   NR Unified Access Control Operational Sequence

Cell Load Measurement

The feature performs barring probability calculations for all unlocked cells every

two seconds. The input to the UE barring probability calculations are the rejection

ratio and the cell usage that are calculated by the following formulas:

- Rejection ratio = the number of rejected UE connection attempts in the cell / the overall number of UE access attempts in the cell Note: The rejection ratio is derived from the connection rejections by the following load control functions in the gNodeB: Priority-Based Admission Control NR Overload Protection Basic L3 UE Admission Control
- Cell usage = the number of connected UEs in the cell / the maximum cell capacity of connected UEs in the cell Note: The cell usage-based UE barring probability calculation is performed only if the upper limit for connected users value is set to higher than 0 in the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe attribute.

Barring Groups and Barring Definition

Maximum eight barring groups can be configured in a cell through the

BarringGroup MO. The BarringGroup MO

defines the relation between the cell load and the barring probability, and assigns

the configured relation to specific access categories, access identities, and

PLMNs.

For the relation between the cell load and the barring probability, each barring

group contains the following configurable attributes that are used to control the

system response to different load levels in the cell:

- The following attributes are used for rejection ratio-based barring probability calculation: The minimum threshold value set for the rejection ratio at which 5% of the UEs are barred, defined in the BarringGroup.rejRatioBarringStart attribute. The maximum threshold value set for the rejection ratio at which 100% of the UEs are barred, defined in the BarringGroup.rejRatioBarringMax attribute.
- The following attributes are used for cell usage-based barring probability calculation: The minimum threshold value set for the cell usage at which 5% of the UEs are barred, defined in the BarringGroup.cellUsageBarringStart attribute. The maximum threshold value set for the cell usage at which the maximum probability of UE barring occurs, defined in the BarringGroup.cellUsageBarringMax attribute. The maximum probability of the cell usage-based UE barring defined in the BarringGroup.maxBarringProbability attribute.

The feature evaluates the relation of the rejection ratio and cell usage values to

the configured minimum and maximum thresholds to calculate the UE barring

probability. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the UE barring curve for both

rejection ratio and cell usage-based barring probability using the configured

minimum and maximum thresholds.

Figure 2   Rejection Ratio-Based Barring Calculation

Figure 3   Cell Usage-Based Barring Calculation

If barring probability calculations are performed for both rejection ratio and cell

usage, the higher value is used as the effective barring, as shown in Figure 4 .

Figure 4   Effective Barring

The assignment of differentiated barring configurations to specific users and

services can be set up through the following attributes that are available in each

barring group:

- The NR access category managed by the barring group, defined in the BarringGroup.accessCategoryList attribute. The access category value can be in the range of 1 to 10.
- The barring probability thresholds, above which the UEs of a particular access identity can be barred, defined in the attributes from BarringGroup.barringStartAi1 to BarringGroup.barringStart Ai15 respectively.Note: The configured barring is always applied to the UEs with Access identity 0. To apply barring for UEs with Access identity 2, the NR Unified Access Control for Mission-Critical Services feature must be active.

In each barring group, it is possible to configure individual barring characteristics

for different PLMNs through the BarringGroup.pLMNIdList attribute

in the following ways:

- If the BarringGroup.pLMNIdList attribute is empty and the BarringGroup.accessCategoryList attribute is defined, the configured barring is applicable to all PLMNs which are not configured in other barring group instances.
- If one or more PLMNs are defined in the BarringGroup.pLMNIdList attribute and the BarringGroup.accessCategoryList is defined, the configured barring is applicable only to the defined PLMNs.
- If one or more PLMNs are defined in the BarringGroup.pLMNIdList attribute and the BarringGroup.accessCategoryList is empty, the defined PLMNs are excluded from barring.

In each barring group, the time interval for the UE to refrain from the re-evaluation

of initiating access attempts can be defined in the

BarringGroup.barringTime attribute.

Barring Information Handling

Based on the barring probability calculation outcome, a cell is either barred to a

certain degree or not barred at all.

If the calculated barring probability changes compared to the previous calculation

and reaches at least 5%, the RRC System Information Block Type 1

message is updated with the barring information and sent to the UE.

If the calculated barring probability changes compared to the previous calculation

and is below 5%, the RRC System Information Block Type 1 message is

sent without barring information.

When barring information is included in the RRC System Information Block Type

1 message, the NrCellCU.uacBroadcast attribute is set

to true.

Barring Information Interpretation by the UE

When the UE initiates an access attempt, it determines one or more access identities

and one access category as shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The access identities and

access categories are used by the UE during the evaluation of latest acquired

barring information in the RRC System Information Block Type 1

message. Based on the evaluated barring information, the UE can decide to postpone

the access attempt or service request.

|   ID | NR Access Identity  (1)             |
|------|-------------------------------------|
|    0 | Regular UE                          |

# 4 Network Impact of NR Unified Access Control

The feature might decrease the number of rejected connection attempts in the

cell.

Capacity and Performance

The feature might decrease the number of rejected connection attempts during high

load conditions in the cell.

The barring information in the RRC System Information Block Type 1

message is continuously adapted to the load conditions in the cell. Dynamic load

conditions can increase the frequency of the RRC System Information Block

Type 1 message updates. This results in more frequent reading of the

RRC System Information Block Type 1 message by the NR standalone

UEs.

Interfaces

This feature affects the Uu interface which is updated to broadcast the barring

information.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of NR Unified Access Control

The feature introduces MO classes and attributes to define UE barring characteristics

in individual cells.

The feature introduces the Uac, UacProfile, and

the BarringGroup MO classes and the attributes that are used to

define the relations between the cell load and the barring probability, and the

barring assignment to specific services, users, and PLMN.

probability calculations for the UEs in the different barring groups.

Figure 5   Rejection Ratio-Based Barring Calculations

With this configuration, the UE barring takes effect with the following

characteristics:

- For regular UEs, the barring of Access category 7 for MO data service starts when the rejection ratio reaches 20% and gets fully barred when the rejection ratio reaches 90%.
- For UEs with Access identity 11, the barring of Access category 7 for MO data service starts when the barring probability is equal to or higher than 50%. Otherwise, the UEs with Access identity 11 are not barred.
- Barring of PLMN-1 UEs never occurs.

With this configuration, the UE barring takes effect with the following

characteristics:

- The barring of Access category 7 for MO data service starts when the cell usage reaches 40% and gets 50% barring probability when cell usage reaches 80%.
- The barring of Access Category 4 for MMTEL voice service starts when the cell usage reaches 60% and gets 30% barring probability when cell usage reaches 80%.

Example 3   Constant Barring of a Cell Using a Configured Barring Probability

It is possible to set up a constant barring of UEs in the cell with a certain barring

probability. To achieve this, the value of the

BarringGroup.cellUsageBarringStart and

BarringGroup.cellUsageBarringMax attributes must be set to 0,

and the BarringGroup.maxBarringProbability attribute must be set

to the required barring probability value. The rejection ratio-based UE barring must

be disabled for this case by using the default values of 100 for

BarringGroup.rejRatioBarringStart and

BarringGroup.rejRatioBarringMax attributes.

## 9.3 Interaction with Load Control Functions

The load indicators in the cell used by the feature for the barring probability

calculations are derived from the following features and load control function in the

gNodeB:

- Priority-Based Admission Control feature
- NR Overload Protection feature
- Basic L3 UE Admission Control function

As the feature considers the load indicators only from activated load control functions,

it is recommended to activate all dependent load control functions together with the

feature.

Table 11 shows the relations between the

activated load control functions, the configuration of parameters and the availability

of rejection ratio and cell usage metrics for the barring probability calculations:

Table 11   Interaction with Load Control Functions

| Configuration of Parameters   | Configuration of Parameters                   | Availability of Load Indicators in the Cell            | Availability of Load Indicators in the Cell   |

| AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe | GNBCUCPFunction.resourceStatusReportF1Enabled | Rejection Ratio                                        | Cell Usage                                    |
| > 0  (1)                      | True                                          | Available for activated load control functions  (2)    | Available                                     |
| > 0  (1)                      | False                                         | Not available                                          | Available                                     |
| == 0  (3)                     | True                                          | Available for activated load control functions  (2)(4) | Not available                                 |
| == 0  (3)                     | False                                         | Not available  (5)                                     | Not available  (5)                            |

(1)

The value of the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe

attribute must be set taking into account the maximum number of

connected UEs for each gNodeB and each sector carrier, as

described in Supported Capacity and Configurations for

NR RAN.

(2)

The activated load control functions can be the Priority-Based

Admission Control, the NR Overload Protection, and the Basic L3

UE Admission Control.

(3)

Cell usage information is not available.

(4)

The UE Admission Control Function 2 part of Priority-Based

Admission Control feature is not available.

(5)

If both rejection ratio and cell usage metrics are unavailable,

the feature can be configured for load-independent barring

only.

## 9.4 Implementation in NR Standalone and NR Non-standalone Combined Deployments

As the barring information is propagated in the RRC System Information Block Type

1 message, which is accessible for NR standalone users only, the

non-standalone UEs that use the cell as a part of the Secondary Cell Group might be

allowed to use the cell despite the NR Unified Access Control barring.

In combined deployments, the released capacity through the barring of NR standalone users

might get utilized by the NR non-standalone users. This additional load can lead to

over-barring of standalone UEs, in case the cell usage load metric is used for barring

probability configuration.

## 9.5 Interpretation of NR Unified Access Control Performance Data

The feature uses the following PM counters to monitor the status and extent of barring in

the cell, and also the reason for the activation of barring:

- NRCellCU.pmEbsUacBarringProbDistrBg$
- NRCellCU.pmEbsUacBarringRejBg$
- NRCellCU.pmEbsUacBarringCellUsageBg$

The counters are defined on cell level and grouped for each barring group instance.

To interpret the performance monitoring data, the MOM configuration for the related

period must be known, so the information on access categories, access identities, and

PLMNs that corresponds to a certain counter value can be retrieved from the

BarringGroup MO.

## 9.6 Recommendations for NR Unified Access Control Configuration

### 9.6.1 Recommendation for Threshold Configuration

It is recommended to avoid setting the minimum and maximum threshold values for rejection

ratio or cell usage-based barring calculations too close to each other. If these

threshold values are too close to each other, the calculated value of the barring

probability might oscillate with greater intensity which might result in more frequent

RRC System Information Block Type 1 message updates.

### 9.6.2 Recommended Setup for Cells with BW Using 24 PRBs for System Information

The number of defined barring groups and PLMNs configured with individual barring

characteristics impacts the size of the barring information content in the RRC

System Information Block Type 1 message. Increasing the number of barring

groups and PLMNs with individual barring characteristics results in increased size of

barring information content in the RRC System Information Block Type 1

message. To assure the robustness of the RRC System Information Block Type

1 reception at the cell edge, it is recommended to configure maximum 2 PLMNs

with individual barring characteristics in a cell configured with BW using 24 PRBs for

system information.

### 9.6.3 Recommendation for MO Data Barring

When the UE is powered on in a cell where Access category 7 for MO data is fully barred,

it cannot set up IMS services, for example, voice or video calls, or SMS. This happens

because Access category 7 access is required to set up the initial PDU session that is

needed for IMS services. This behavior is important to consider when Unified Access

Control (UAC) is configured in areas where the users power on devices to set up IMS

services, for example, to make phone calls after the airplane lands. In such

deployments, it is not recommended to configure UAC to bar Access category 7 with 100%

barring probability.
