Summary

This feature introduces support for using the RRC state preference of the UE through

the UAI procedure in NR standalone and NR-DC deployments in Low-Band and

Mid-Band.

The UAI procedure

allows the UE

to send status information and the corresponding preferred network action to the

network. This enables the gNodeB to release the UE to RRC\_IDLE or

RRC\_INACTIVE state earlier than the expiry of the timers that monitor UE inactivity.

Limiting the time spent in RRC\_CONNECTED state saves power for UEs that experience

bursts of network traffic instead of continuous traffic.

Additional Information

For more information about this feature, see 3GPP TS 38.331, NR; Radio Resource

Control (RRC); Protocol specification.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The RRC-state preference of the UE is considered only if the

preferredRRC-State IE is received and

no

UE measurements are configured.

This feature is not supported on High-Band standalone deployments.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM version salso.

# 3 Feature Operation of UE-Assisted RRC State Preference

This feature supports UE RRC preference indication using the UAI

procedure.

This feature uses the standardized UAI

procedure,

which enables UEs to send their RRC preference to the gNodeB.

Operational Process

Figure 1   UE-Assisted RRC State Preference Operation

1. The gNodeB configures the UAI RRC release preference at the initial context setup or after the RRC Resume procedure through the RRCReconfiguration message. The configuration is based on the UE capabilities and the configuration of the UaiProfileUeCfg.releasePrefConfig attribute.
2. If the UE expects no more transmissions, the UE sends the UEAssistanceInformation message to the gNodeB. The UEAssistanceInformation message contains the RRC release preference of the UE.
3. The gNodeB determines if the UE can be released. If the gNodeB determines that the UE can be released, the UE is released based on the RRC release preference report to RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE state.

## 3.1 UAI Configuration for UE-Assisted RRC State Preference

The UE-assisted RRC state preference indication reporting is based on the UAI

procedure.

UE-assisted RRC state preference indication reports can be enabled on the gNodeB

level.

The UAI procedure is configured for RRC state preference indication if the following

conditions are met:

- The UaiProfileUeCfg.releasePrefConfig attribute is set to true.
- The UE supports the PowSav-ParametersCommon-r16.releasePreference-r16 UE capability.

UE radio access capabilities are

reported

to the gNodeB in the UECapabilityInformation

message.

## 3.2 UAI RRC State Preference Indication from the UE

The UE can indicate a release preference in the

UEAssistanceInformation

message.

If the UE expects no more transmissions, the UE can indicate a preference to be released

from connected state before the expiration of the timers that monitor inactivity. In

this case, the UE sends the UEAssistanceInformation message to the

gNodeB. This message contains the release preference of the UE, which is indicated by

the preferredRRC-State IE.

The following values of the preferredRRC-State IE are supported:

Table 2   Supported preferredRRC-State IE Values

| Value          | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| idle           | The UE prefers to be released from connected state to idle state.                                                                             |
| inactive       | The UE prefers to be released from connected state to inactive                                 state.                                         |
| outOfConnected | The UE prefers to be released from connected state, but has no                                 preference over idle state and inactive state. |

If the UE indicates a release preference to the gNodeB, the UE cannot send further

release preference indications during the same RRC connection.

## 3.3 Target RRC State Determination

If the gNodeB receives a valid release preference indication from the UE in the

UEAssistanceInformation

message, an

inactivity-handling

procedure is triggered.

The gNodeB checks the following conditions that allow for the inactive state-targeted

release of the UE:

- The RRC Inactive State feature is enabled.
- The UE supports RRC\_INACTIVE state.
- The CNAI is stored in the UE context.
- The UE is not configured with NR-DC.
- The UE is not in limited service mode.
- The RrcInactiveProfileUeCfg.rrcInactiveStateSupport attribute is set to true.

Release to Inactive State

The UAI procedure-enabled release of the UE to inactive state is possible only if the

following conditions are met:

- The gNodeB receives a valid release preference indication from the UE in the UEAssistanceInformation message.
- The result of the target RRC state mapping is the RRC\_INACTIVE state.

If the UEAssistanceInformation message contains the

inactive

or the outOfConnected value, the UE

targets

the RRC\_INACTIVE state.

Release to Idle State

If the UE does not meet the conditions for inactive state-targeted release, the UE is

released to RRC\_IDLE state.

If the UEAssistanceInformation message contains the

idle

value, the UE targets the RRC\_IDLE state.

Release Preference Override

The UaiUeCfg.releasePrefOverride attribute affects release

preference handling on the gNodeB level. If the

UaiUeCfg.releasePrefOverride attribute is configured, the

release preference indication value of the UE is changed according to the configured

attribute. The target state of the UE is the RRC\_INACTIVE state. If the RRC\_INACTIVE

state is not supported, the UE is released to the RRC\_IDLE state.

If the UaiUeCfg.releasePrefOverride attribute is set to

inactive,

the UE is released to the RRC\_INACTIVE state.

If the UaiUeCfg.releasePrefOverride attribute is set to

idle,

the UE is released to the RRC\_IDLE state.

# 4 Network Impact of UE-Assisted RRC State Preference

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces

the

RRC Resume procedure as an additional trigger for configuring the UAI overheating

mitigation and the RRC state preference procedures in NR

standalone.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

If the NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation or the UE-Assisted RRC State Preference

feature is enabled, the gNodeB triggers a new RRC Reconfiguration procedure after

the RRC Resume procedure. The UAI configuration is provided to the UE in the

OtherConfig

IE.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the Uu interface in the following

ways:

- The RRCReconfiguration message is sent immediately after the RRC Resume procedure if any feature using the UAI procedure is configured.
- The RRCReconfiguration message is triggered after the RRC Resume procedure by features using the UAI procedure. In this case, only the otherConfig IE, which contains the UAI configuration information, is sent in the RRCReconfiguration message.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
