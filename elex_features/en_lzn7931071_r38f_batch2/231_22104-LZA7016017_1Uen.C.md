Summary

Transmitting RLC ACK status PDUs by themselves is not resource-efficient for the gNodeB. The

feature provides delay options for the downlink transmission of RLC ACK status PDUs

in Low-Band and Mid-Band. This enhances the opportunity for

standalone

RLC ACK status PDUs to be transmitted together with other

downlink transmissions to the same UE, reducing the total number of downlink

scheduling events.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improved energy efficiency
- Improved downlink spectral efficiency
- More efficient allocation of PDCCH and PDSCH resources

# 2 Dependencies of Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

The feature has dependencies with other features that

contribute

to the delay of downlink transmission.

Hardware

The feature is not supported on RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5e.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

The feature introduces configurable delay options for the downlink transmission of

Radio Link Control (RLC) ACK status Protocol Data Units (PDUs) by leveraging the relaxed

transmission timing requirements of such PDUs.

By delaying the downlink transmission of RLC ACK status PDUs, the feature enhances the

opportunity for these PDUs to be transmitted together with other downlink transmissions

to the same UE, improving NR performance.

Standalone RLC ACK Status PDU

The feature only delays standalone RLC ACK status PDU transmissions. This means that

the candidate UE does not have data in any downlink buffer except for the RLC ACK

status PDU.

In uplink RLC Acknowledged Mode

(AM)

transmission, the UE triggers RLC status requests by sending an RLC poll to the

gNodeB. The time to receive a poll response of

RLC

ACK or RLC NACK is defined by the

DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollReTransmitUl and

the

SignalingRadioBearer.tPollReTransmitUl

attributes. The feature leverages this timer to allow downlink transmission delay

for standalone RLC ACK status PDUs. This

enables

them to be transmitted with other downlink data.

Delay Values of Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

The feature introduces the DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode

and

the SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode

attributes to set delay values for the downlink transmission of RLC ACK status PDUs.

The default value of the DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode

and

the SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode

attributes is NO\_DELAY, which means that the delay functionality is

not activated. To activate the delay functionality for a radio bearer, the

DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode

or

the SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode

attribute must be set to a value other than NO\_DELAY. The

recommended value for the DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode

and

the SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode

attributes is BALANCED.

The delay values are calculated considering the values of the following uplink RLC

attributes to keep uplink RLC service quality unaffected:

- DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollReTransmitUl
- DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyUl
- SignalingRadioBearer.tPollReTransmitUl
- SignalingRadioBearer.tReassemblyUl

# 4 Network Impact of Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

The feature improves downlink energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. It also

improves PDCCH and PDSCH resource allocation.

Capacity and Performance

The feature reduces the number of downlink transmission events, which potentially

increases the frequency of sleep events of the NR Micro Sleep Tx feature. This

improves

the energy efficiency of the network. The improvement is more visible under low and

medium traffic loads.

The feature improves downlink spectral efficiency by reducing the use of extra

padding bits required for the transmission of standalone Radio Link Control (RLC)

ACK status Protocol Data Units (PDUs).

The delay options for the downlink transmission of RLC ACK status PDUs contribute to

a more efficient use of PDCCH and PDSCH resource

allocation,

that reduces the likelihood of PDSCH and PUSCH blocking.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

The feature introduces attributes to configure delay values for the downlink

transmission of Radio Link Control (RLC) ACK status Protocol Data Units (PDUs). Some uplink

RLC attributes affect the operation of the feature.

Counters

The improvement in energy efficiency can be observed through the following PM

counters:

- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergy
- EnergyMeter.pmPowerConsumption
- NRSectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime
- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffTime

The

improved PDCCH and PDSCH resource allocation and the decreased

frequency of PDSCH and PUSCH blocking can be observed through the following PM

counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacPdcchBlockingPdschOccasions
- NRCellDU.pmMacPdcchBlockingPuschOccasions
- NRCellDU.pmPdschSchedActivity

The NRCellDU.pmActiveUeDlSum PM counter might decrease because of

the increased likelihood of standalone Radio Link Control (RLC) ACK status Protocol

Data Units (PDUs) transmitted together with other downlink data.

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012795 MO instance.
2. Set the transmission delay value for Radio Link Control (RLC) ACK status Protocol Data Units (PDUs) of the chosen type of radio bearer.
    - For DRB, set the DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode attribute to a value other than NO\_DELAY.
    - For SRB, set the SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode attribute to a value other than NO\_DELAY.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012795 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Energy-Optimized Slot Allocation

The attributes of the feature can be configured considering traffic load

conditions.

Under high traffic load, the delay in the transmission of standalone RLC ACK status PDUs

might degrade network accessibility KPIs. It is recommended not to set the value of the

DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode or the

SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode attribute to

HIGH under high traffic load.

If KPI degradation is observed, set the value of the

SignalingRadioBearer.rlcAckPduDelayMode attribute to

NO\_DELAY and the value of the

DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcAckPduDelayMode attribute to

VERY\_LOW or LOW.
