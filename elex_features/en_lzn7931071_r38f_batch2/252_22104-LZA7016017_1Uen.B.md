Summary

The NR Soft Admission feature allows the admission of a new QoS flow after the configured

limit for QoS flows is reached. The new QoS flow is admitted with alternative QoS

treatment. The configured QoS treatment does not change during the QoS flow life

cycle unless the 5QI value of the QoS flow is modified.

This feature provides increased accessibility for services when the configured QoS

flow limit is reached.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Soft Admission

This feature allows the admission of a new QoS flow when the configured limit for QoS

flows is reached.

The NR Soft Admission feature allows the admission of a new QoS flow after reaching the

configured limit of QoS flows for a traffic set member. The new QoS flow is admitted

with alternative QoS treatment. The configured QoS treatment does not change during the

QoS flow life cycle unless the 5QI value of the QoS is modified.

For more information on setting QoS flow limits and configuring traffic set members, see

NR Service Admission Control.

Operational Process

This feature uses the FlowLimit.softAdmissionEnabled attribute to

configure whether a new QoS flow can be soft-admitted.

The soft admission function can be triggered by the service admission control

function during the following procedures:

- UE Context Setup
- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify

If the value of the FlowLimit.softAdmissionEnabled attribute is

set to true when reaching the configured limit for QoS flows, the

new QoS flow is admitted with alternative treatment.

The alternative QoS flow treatment consists of the following configurations:

- Scheduling algorithm is set to RESOURCE\_FAIR.
- Priority domain is set to 64.
- Relative priority is set to 1.

The alternative QoS flow treatment applies to all soft-admitted traffic.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Soft Admission

This feature might affect KPIs.

Capacity and Performance

This feature might affect the following KPIs:

- Accessibility
- Integrity

It is recommended to configure the NR Soft Admission feature for QoS flows with

flexible QoS requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
