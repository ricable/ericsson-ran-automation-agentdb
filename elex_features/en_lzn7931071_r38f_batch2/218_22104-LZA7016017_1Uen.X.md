Summary

This feature provides measurement results of PSCell

(or PCell),

serving MO list, and NR neighbor cell list. Each measurement

result includes RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR measurement results associated with cells and

beams. The cell and beam measurements of

PSCell (or

PCell) and NR neighbor cells are intra-frequency only, supporting

up to eight neighboring cells.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Collection of RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR measurement results during UE connection. The collected data can be used to optimize, maintain, and troubleshoot the network in the following cases: Investigation of dropped calls or UE throughput associated UE sessions NR RET and cell shaping
- Different Periodic UE Measurements (PUEM) configurations for different UE groups in a flexible and easily extendable way.
- Not requiring user consent to trigger the measurements as no sensitive data is collected from UEs.
- A coverage heat map with UE session information enabled by the data collected during UE connection.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

In case of High-Band measurement, only the best beam result is included in the PM events

CuCpPerUePuemEndcReport

and CuCpPerUePuemSaReport.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

If the

Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on

earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of Periodic UE Measurements

This feature provides periodic

measurement reports based on data from the UEs.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Procedures Related to the Periodic UE Measurements

Feature

for NR NSA

1. The eNodeB sends an X2AP SgNB Addition Request message to the gNodeB after the operator activates the feature.
2. The gNodeB initiates the feature configuration by sending an X2AP SgNB Addition Request Acknowledge message back to the eNodeB that encapsulates the RRC Reconfiguration message.
3. The eNodeB performs RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedures.
4. The eNodeB receives a measurement report from the UE.
5. The eNodeB sends an X2AP RRC Transfer message that encapsulates the measurement report to the gNodeB.

Figure 1 covers the initial access use case

signaled by SgNB Addition Request.

For NR NSA deployments, the following opportunities to update UE measurement

configuration are also available:

- MeNodeB-initiated modification through SCG addition
- gNodeB-initiated modification through PSCell change
- UE group change through EPS bearer addition or removal

Figure 2   Procedures Related to the Periodic UE Measurements Feature for NR SA

1. The AMF sends an NGAP Initial Context Setup message to the gNodeB after the operator activates the feature.
2. The gNodeB performs RRC Reconfiguration procedures to initiate measurement for the Periodic UE Measurements (PUEM) feature.
3. The gNodeB receives a measurement report from the UE.

Figure 2 covers the initial access use case

signaled by NGAP Initial Context Setup.

For NR SA deployments, the following opportunities to update UE measurement

configuration are also available:

- NGAP Handover Request
- XNAP Handover Request
- Intra-gNB handover
- RRC Resume
- UE group change through Packet Data Unit (PDU) session setup, modification, or release

## 3.1 UE Group Support for Periodic UE Measurements

This feature is adapted to the UE Grouping Framework.

The feature can be configured with the following attributes, which belong to the

PuemCellProfileUeCfg MO classes that are adapted to the UE

Grouping

Framework:

- PuemCellProfileUeCfg.puemReportConfigPeriodical
- PuemCellProfileUeCfg.puemUeGroupEnabled

The attributes are read from the MO class instance that is selected based on the UE

groups that the UE belongs to.

When the UE groups that the UE belongs to change, the change can result in the selection

of a new instance of the PuemCellProfileUeCfg MO class to which the

listed attributes belong. If ongoing periodic UE measurements

exist

in the UE and any of the listed attributes has a new

value

because of the selection of a new MO instance, the periodic UE measurements are

reconfigured with the new values in the UE. If no ongoing periodic UE measurements exist

and the Periodic UE Measurements feature is enabled after the UE group

change,

periodic UE measurements

are

configured in the UE.

The UE group

support

is controlled by the User- and Service-Specific Mobility feature. If the license of this

feature is not activated, configuration data is always taken from the

Base instances of the PuemCellProfileUeCfg MO

class.

For more information on the feature license activation, see User- and Service-Specific Mobility.

# 4 Network Impact of Periodic UE Measurements

This feature

increases the load on the PM event receivers and the Uu interface.

Capacity and Performance

When the feature is activated, every incoming measurement report triggered by the

Periodic

UE Measurements feature generates a PM event

CuCpPerUePuemEndcReportfor

NR NSA, or CuCpPerUePuemSaReport for NR SA,

which increases the processing load on PM event receivers. The increasing number of

PM events also increases the load on the transport network when they are transmitted

to the ENM.

The PuemCellProfile.puemCellTargetIntensity attribute is used to

control the number of PM event CuCpPerUePuemEndcReport

or

CuCpPerUePuemSaReport

to reduce load on the network. Characterization of the impact of

measurement report processing as input to setting the

PuemCellProfile.puemCellTargetIntensity attribute is

described in Engineering Guidelines for Periodic UE Measurements.

It is recommended to consider changes to measurement parameters related to report

amount and report interval:

- Avoid setting high or infinite report amounts in high load cases.
- Decreasing the report amount decreases the overall contribution to load by a single UE.
- Increasing the report interval decreases the overall contribution to load by a single UE.

Interfaces

The feature increases the load on the Uu interface in the following situations:

- UE measurements are initiated or terminated.
- A UE is sending measurement reports to the gNodeB.

Other Network Elements

This feature introduces additional measurement configuration and collection from UEs.

This has potential to decrease overall throughput and increase latency for mobility

related signaling. Reporting of the measurements by the UE has the potential to

decrease battery life for the UE.

This feature contributes to the need for storing more PM events on the PM event

receiver.

# 5 Parameters for Periodic UE Measurements

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Periodic UE Measurements

## 9.1 Configuration of Target Intensity Handling

The PM counters

NRCellCU.pmEndcUeMeasurementReportPuem

and

NRCellCU.pmSaUeMeasurementReportPuem

count

the number of received reports for the Periodic UE Measurements (PUEM) feature. The

target number of received PUEM reports of each cell can be configured by setting the

PuemCellProfile.puemCellTargetIntensity attribute. This attribute

controls the number of UE selection for PUEM per hour, as shown by Table 3.

Table 3   Number of UE Selections Per Hour

|   Number of UE Selections | Time for One UE Selection   | Description     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
|                         0 | N/A                         | No UE selection |
|                       360 | 3600/360 = 10s              | Default         |
|                       720 | 3600/720 = 5s               | Maximum         |
|                      1440 | 3600/1440 = 2.5s            | x 2             |
|                      2160 | 3600/2160 = 1.67s           | x 3             |
|                      2880 | 3600/2880 = 1.25s           | x 4             |
|                      3600 | 3600/3600 = 1s              | x 5             |

To decrease or increase the number of received PUEM reports, decrease or increase the

value of the PuemCellProfile.puemCellTargetIntensity attribute

accordingly.

The recommended range of the PuemCellProfile.puemCellTargetIntensity

attribute is [0..720] based on cell traffic condition. If there are very few UEs in the

cell, the value of the PuemCellProfile.puemCellTargetIntensity

attribute can be extended to [1440, 2160, 2880, 3600].

Collection and reporting of PUEM measurements collected from UEs can make a significant

contribution to the CPU use of the node. Therefore, PUEM measurement report processing

is kept below 1 measurement report per second for each cell. This keeps the CPU impact

below 2% on all supported platforms.

## 9.2 Configuration of UE Grouping Handling

Differentiated configurations for UEs under different UE groups are supported.

For example, the

following configuration can be used to enable PUEM measurement to the specific UE

vendor:

- Defining the ID of the specific UE vendor through the PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.prefUeGroupId attribute.
- Defining the UE group selection criteria through the PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria attribute. The variable imeisv is recommended.
- Setting the PuemCellProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList attribute with the previously defined UE group ID.
- Setting the PuemCellProfileUeCfg.puemUeGroupEnabled attribute to true.

For more information, see UE Grouping Framework.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces support of PCell measurement results for NR SA.

The collected PCell measurement results can be used to optimize, maintain, or

troubleshoot NR SA networks.

Capacity and Performance

When the PUEM feature is activated for NR SA, every incoming measurement report

triggered by the PUEM feature generates a PM event

CuCpPerUePuemSaReport, which increases the processing load

on PM event receivers.

The increasing number of PM events also increases the load on the transport network

when they are transmitted to the ENM.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the CuCpPerUePuemSaReport PM

event.

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmSaUeMeasurementReportPuem
- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasSaSsRsrp

Interfaces

The feature enhancement increases the load on the Uu interface in the following

situations:

- UE measurements are initiated or terminated.
- A UE is sending measurement reports to the gNodeB.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

CuCpPerUePuemSaReport PM event introduced by this feature

enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the PM event

is supported on earlier ENM versions also.
