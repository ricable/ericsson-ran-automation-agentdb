# 1 5GA Advanced Cell Supervision Overview

This feature provides sleeping cell detection and recovery based on downlink TX power

monitoring on the sector carrier.

Summary

This feature provides sleeping cell detection and recovery based on downlink TX power

monitoring on the sector carrier.

If not enough transmitted power is detected, and automatic recovery is allowed by the

configuration, an automatic sector carrier re-setup, and cell re-setup is triggered as a

recovery action. If not enough transmitted power is detected and automatic recovery is not

allowed by the configuration, the Downlink TX No Power Detected

alarm is raised immediately.

The operator is alarmed if the recovery action fails. Observability of all detections and

undertaken remedy actions are provided.

The introduced mechanism improves system availability and increases awareness of sleeping

cell problems in the network.

# 3 Feature Operation of 5GA Advanced Cell Supervision

This feature introduces the automatic re-setup of sector

carriers

and

cells

as a remedy action in case the cell is asleep.

If

no

TX power on sector carrier is suspected, the system tries to

self-heal.

Downlink TX power monitoring on sector

carriers

helps detect when a cell

is

asleep. If a sleeping cell is suspected, recovery is triggered.

If

the recovery is successful, the

service

is regained.

The operator is alarmed if the recovery action fails, and the cell is still suspected to

be in sleeping status.

Other remedy actions can be applied

by

the operator immediately, without waiting for KPI degradation or user complaints.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Successful Recovery After No TX Power Is Detected

The feature operates the following way if recovery is successful:

1. No downlink TX power indicates that a sleeping cell is detected on the radio unit. PM Event indicating no TX power detection is sent.
2. An automatic sector carrier and cell re-setup is triggered.
3. After a successful recovery, service is regained.
4. After 15 minutes, recovery is regarded as successful. PM Event indicating successful recovery is sent.

Figure 2   Unsuccessful Recovery After No TX Power Is Detected

The feature operates the following way if recovery is unsuccessful:

1. No downlink TX power indicates that a sleeping cell is detected on the radio unit. PM Event indicating no TX power detection is sent.
2. An automatic re-setup of the sector carrier and the cell is triggered.
3. After an unsuccessful recovery, the Downlink TX No Power Detected alarm is raised. PM Event indicating failed recovery is sent.

Figure 3   Partially Successful Recovery After No TX Power is Detected

The feature operates the following way if the recovery is partially

successful:

1. No downlink TX power indicates that a sleeping cell is detected on the radio unit. PM Event indicating no TX power detection is sent.
2. An automatic re-setup of the sector carrier and the cell is triggered. Not all branches are affected by no downlink TX power.
3. After an unsuccessful recovery, the Downlink TX No Power Detected Service Degraded alarm is raised. PM Event indicating failed recovery is sent.

Figure 4   No Recovery is Performed After No TX Power is Detected

The feature introduces the noTxPowerAction attribute on the

NRSectorCarrier MO class.

The noTxPowerAction attribute controls which recovery action is

performed when the Advanced Cell Supervision feature detects no downlink TX power on

the sector carrier.

If noTxPowerAction = NO\_ACTION is applicable, no

automatic recovery is performed.

Figure 5   5GA Advanced Cell Supervision Flowchart

The feature operates the following

way:

1. The detection of no TX power takes approximately 10 minutes.
2. No downlink TX power detected on any one carrier branch of an NRSectorCarrier MO triggers the sector carrier and the cell re-setup as a recovery action.
3. Any subsequent detections on other carrier branches while the recovery is ongoing are ignored.
4. Recovery is regarded as failed if no TX power issue reappears within 15 minutes.

# 7 Activate 5GA Advanced Cell Supervision

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
