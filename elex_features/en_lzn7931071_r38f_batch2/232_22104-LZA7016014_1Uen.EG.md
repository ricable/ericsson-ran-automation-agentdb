Summary

IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization enables support for the IEEE 1588 standard,

which provides high precision network synchronization where timing information is

transported over a packet network. The feature also enables the following:

- Quality Level Supervision of PTP references.
- Support for IEEE 1588v2 PTP for time, phase, and frequency synchronization.
- Support for G.8275.1 PTP telecom profile with full timing support from the network.
- Support for G.8275.2 PTP telecom profile with PTS with regular network limits.
- Support for G.8275.2 PTP telecom profile with PTS with relaxed network limits.
- Support for the IEEE 1588 Appendix J3 default profile.
- Support for the IEEE 1588 Custom profile with full timing support from the network.

The system clock of the node can be locked to a central time server in the RAN,

providing a clock source for the time and phase synchronization of the Uu interface.

The transport network can also carry synchronization information between the nodes

and the time server.

IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization supports indoor environments where satellite

based time sources cannot be used. IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization provides

high accuracy in large networks where the distance of the time server is several

router hops.

G.8275.2 PTP profile for time and phase synchronization with Partial Timing Support (PTS)

is not recommended for services that require strict time synchronization (for example

TDD).

Network Requirements

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a valid

license key must be installed and the feature must be explicitly activated by setting a MOM

attribute.

- There must be a PTP grandmaster present in the network.
- Depending on network topology, PTP Boundary Clocks or Transparent Clocks must be present in the network, see profile-specific information.
- Path time error caused by asymmetry from PTP grandmaster to node in MOM must follow the network topology. If needed, different value than default must be set, see profile-specific information.
- The use of 1000BASE-T SFP modules, that typically come with an RJ45 connector is not recommended. Such SFP modules can cause PDV to exceed the node PDV tolerance limit, which results in disabled synchronization references. For 1000BASE-T connections, it is recommended to use RJ45 connectors on the front side of the unit. Alternatively, it is recommended to use SFP-DAC cables.
- When PTP over Ethernet is to be used on an Ethernet port, that is part of LAG, PTP must be configured on the same Ethernet link on both ends.

Requirements for the G.8275.1 Profile

- The PTP grandmaster must support the G.8275.1 profile.
- The boundary clock that is connected to the node must to support the G.8275.1 profile.
- The PTP grandmaster must support PTP over Ethernet Multicast.
- G.8275.1 Telecom profile for time synchronization requires that the synchronization network is a "Full on path support" PTP network. This means that there must be PTP Boundary Clocks or Transparent Clocks in every network element between the PTP grandmaster and the PTP Slave.
- Path time error is the maximum absolute time error generated by the chain of boundary and transparent clocks, and the time error caused by link asymmetry of worst case path from PTP grandmaster to node. This corresponds to the network limit at reference point C according to G.8271.1 without time error introduced by grandmaster. Time error introduced by the grandmaster is taken from the grandmasterClockAccuracy member in the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.parentDS attribute. Maximum absolute time error is the theoretical sum of worst case of each component. Sum of path time error can be calculated by following ITU-T standard G.8271.1 Appendix IV, or it can be measured at the input of the Baseband unit. The error value can be updated with the PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute.
- The G.8275.1 profile allows up to 250 ns of PDV. Selecting this profile requires that the PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -4, to represent 16 packets per second.

Requirements for the G.8275.2 Profile

- The PTP grandmaster must support the G.8275.2 profile.
- The PTP grandmaster must support PTP over IP Unicast. Note: The RAN Grand Master feature does not support PTP over IP Unicast.
- The PTP sync message rate of the PTP grandmaster must be 64 packets per second.
- Path time error is the measured error of worst case path from PTP grandmaster to the node. The error value can be updated with PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute.
- The time error must be less than 1.1 μs at the input to the base station. For G.8275.2 profile with relaxed limits, the requirement is extended to 500 μs. Note: The time alignment error at the air interface can be up to 1.5 µs if network conditions from ITU-T G.8271.2 are fulfilled. For G.8275.2 profile with relaxed limits, the time alignment can be up to 500 μs. The actual time alignment error is dependent on the network conditions.
- PDV limit is 42 µs and its value must be lower at the input to the base station. For G.8275.2 profile with relaxed limits, the PDV limit is extended to 1.05 ms.

Requirements for the IEEE 1588 Appendix J3 Profile

- The IEEE\_1588\_J3 profile allows higher PDV than G.8275.1 For PDV that is up to 250 ns, the recovered clock accuracy is the same as for G.8275.1. In case the synchronization message rate is at least 64 packets per second, PDV of up to 100 µs is tolerated, but the recovered clock accuracy deteriorates and the locking time is increased up to 90 minutes. This might impact the features on the node.
- The PTP grandmaster must support the IEEE 1588 Appendix J3 profile.
- The PTP grandmaster must support PTP over Ethernet Multicast.

The following options of the ptpProfile MO attribute are based on the

IEEE\_1588\_J3 profile:

- The IEEEE\_1588\_TIME\_DEFAULT option allows a packet rate of 8, 16, or 32 event packets per second. This profile allows up to 250 ns of PDV, and the recovered clock accuracy is the same as for G.8275.1. Selecting this option requires that the PtpBcOcPort.ptpMulticastAddress attribute is set according to network planning, and the PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -3, to represent 8 packets per second, -4, to represent 16 packets per second, or -5, to represent 32 packets per second.
- Path time error is the maximum absolute time error generated by the chain of boundary and transparent clocks, and the time error caused by link asymmetry of worst case path from PTP grandmaster to node. This corresponds to the network limit at reference point C according to G.8271.1 without time error introduced by the grandmaster. Time error introduced by the grandmaster is taken from the grandmasterClockAccuracy member in the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.parentDS attribute. Maximum absolute time error is the theoretical sum of the worst case of each component. The sum of path time error can be calculated by following ITU-T standard G.8271.1 Appendix IV, or it can be measured at the input of the Baseband unit. The error value can be updated with the PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute.
- The IEEEE\_1588\_TIME\_SLOW option allows a packet rate of 64 or 128 event packets per second with the ability to work in networks with high PDV, that is, PDV up to 100 μs. This profile deteriorates the recovered clock accuracy and increases the locking time up to 90 minutes, which might impact the time features on the node. Selecting this option requires that the PtpBcOcPort.ptpMulticastAddress attribute is set according to network planning, and the PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -6, to represent 64 packets per second.
- Path time error is the measured error of worst case path from PTP grandmaster to the node. The error value can be updated with PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute.

Requirements for the IEEE 1588 Custom Profile

- The PTP grandmaster must support the G.8275.2 profile.
- The PTP grandmaster must support PTP over IP Unicast. Note: The RAN Grand Master feature does not support PTP over IP Unicast.
- The input to the Radio Node fulfills the network limits for time synchronization in packet networks with full timing support from the network. These limits are specified in ITU-T G.8271.1.
- Path time error is the maximum absolute time error generated by the chain of boundary and transparent clocks, and the time error caused by the link asymmetry of the worst case path from the PTP grandmaster to the node. This corresponds to the network limit at reference point C according to G.8271.1 without time error introduced by the grandmaster. Time error introduced by the grandmaster is taken from the grandmasterClockAccuracy member in the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.parentDS attribute. Maximum absolute time error is the theoretical sum of the worst case of each component. The sum of path time error can be calculated by following ITU-T standard G.8271.1 Appendix IV, or it can be measured at the input of the Baseband unit. The error value can be updated with the PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute.
- The IEEE 1588 Custom profile allows up to 250 ns of PDV.
- The IEEE 1588 Custom profile allows the complete range of packet rates in the PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval and PtpBcOcPort.announceMessageInterval attributes. Depending on the grandmaster in the network, the selected rate can be granted or rejected at the next unicast negotiation after the period set in the PtpBcOcPort.durationField timer expires. Note: Changing the PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval and PtpBcOcPort.announceMessageInterval attributes in run-time can cause temporary traffic disturbances.

Requirements for PTP over VLAN

- The tnPortId attribute of the TnPort MO indicates that a TN or an IDLe port is used for the VLAN.
- If a TN port is used, check that a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO refers to the VlanPort MO. To determine if a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO has to be used, refer to the transport network or the IP address plan. If the transport network or the IP address plan does not have any Bridge, InterfaceIPv4, or InterfaceIPv6 MO recommendations, create a Bridge MO.
- If an IDLe port is used, check that an ENodeBFunction MO instance is available, and the eranVlanPortRef attribute refers to the same VlanPort MO instance as the PtpBcOcPort MO does. The operState attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO must be set to ENABLED before configuring the PtpBcOcPort MO that points to the same VlanPort MO instance.

# 3 Feature Operation of IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization operates according to one of the following

profiles:

- G.8275.1 - profile for phase and time synchronization with full timing support from the network
- IEEE 1588 Custom - profile for phase and time synchronization with full timing support from the network
- G.8275.2 - profile for phase and time synchronization with PTS with regular network limits
- G.8275.2 - profile for phase and time synchronization with PTS with relaxed network limits
- IEEE 1588 Appendix J3 profiles

A PTP slave uses PTP to synchronize to a PTP grandmaster, which enables the node to recover

both the frequency and the time or phase from a PRTC or ePRTC source.

PTP packets are sent untagged over Ethernet, or tagged over

VLAN between nodes and the PTP grandmaster.

It is possible to configure a node with up to

eight

slave-only ordinary clocks, which can be

G.8275.1,

G.8275.2, or IEEE 1588

Custom. For G.8275.1, the node uses the reference from the closest boundary

clock. For G.8275.1, the boundary clock that is connected to the node must support the

G.8275.1 profile. For

G.8275.2 and IEEE 1588

Custom, each PTP slave-only ordinary clock is configured to a PTP

grandmaster. The PTP grandmaster can be selected from the recommendations in the Network

Synchronization Plan.

The

PTP reference status can be read with the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockStatus

and the PtpBcOcPort.ptpPortStatus

attributes.

For G.8275.2 and IEEE 1588 Custom slave-only ordinary clocks, when the G.8275.2 profile is

active, each slave-only ordinary clock starts the unicast negotiation towards the associated

grandmaster. When the grandmaster grants unicast transmission, it starts sending

synchronization information to the PTP slave. All PTP slaves evaluate the grandmasters by

monitoring defects and PM counters, and by filtering alarms.

Figure 1   IEEE 1588 Network View

There is a delay asymmetry between the grandmaster and the time synchronization reference.

This can be configured in the MOM, however the node cannot detect the asymmetry error. It is

possible to measure the asymmetry with a GNSS time synchronization reference, but when using

partial timing support, the node cannot detect the slow changes in asymmetry. This can result

in the following cases:

- a degraded reference
- the alarm being raised
- the asymmetry going undetected

With a Baseband radio node synchronized to GNSS, it is possible to measure the

characteristics of PTP input according to ITU-T G.8271.2 for PTS profile or

ITU-T G.8271.1 for FTS profile. For more information, see Manage Network Synchronization.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization synchronizes the time and phase of the system

clock (slave) of the RBS to a master clock provided by a time server.

Figure 2   Clock Reference Generation with PTP

The time server and the RBS exchange messages and generate a series of timestamps:

1. The time server sends a Sync message and notes the time, T1, at which it was sent.
2. The RBS receives the Sync message and notes the time of reception, T2.
3. The time server conveys the time stamp T1 to the RBS by embedding T1 in the Sync message, or by sending T1 embedded in a separate Follow\_Up message.
4. The RBS sends a Delay\_Req message to the time server and notes the time T3, at which it was sent.
5. The time server receives the Delay\_Req message and notes the time of reception, T4.
6. The master conveys the timestamp T4 to the slave embedded in a Delay\_Resp message.

At the end of this process, the RBS has all four timestamps. These can be used to calculate

the offset of the slave clock to the master, and the mean propagation time of messages

between the two clocks:

The slave offset o(t) at a time t is defined by the following formula:

o(t) = s(t) - m(t)

Where s(t) represents the time measured at the slave at the physical time t, and m(t)

represents the time measured at the master at the physical time t.

The following assumptions are made:

- The transmission time of a message from the time server to the RBS (tms) is assumed to be equal to the transmission time of a message from the RBS to the time server (tsm). This time is denoted as d.
- The offset is constant during the time when the message exchange between the time server and the RBS takes place. This time is denoted as o.

With these assumptions, the following relations exist between timestamps o and d:

- T2-T1 = o + d
- T4-T3 = -o + d

Variables o and d can then be resolved according to the following equations:

- o = ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) /2
- d= ((T2 - T1) + (T4 - T3)) /2

The slave clock in the RBS corrects its local time by subtracting the calculated offset

from the measured local time.

In a real deployment, the assumptions for o and d are not fulfilled. For time and phase

synchronization, it is necessary to compensate for transport delay asymmetry. The asymmetry

compensation term can be configured up to ±100 μs.

The slave clock repeats the synchronization procedure frequently and applies

filtering algorithms to make corrections for transport delay variations.

# 4 Network Impact of IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

Capacity and Performance

The required packet rate is dependent on network quality. For each synchronization message

that the node receives, it generates a Delay\_Req message. The

message rates are continuous, even when the slave clock enters locked mode. If the node can

lock the clock for the Uu interface to the time server, IEEE 1588 Time and Phase

Synchronization has no further impact on system behavior and performance.

When an EthernetPort instance is already used by PTP over Ethernet and

selected as an active reference, adding or removing the EthernetPort on a

LagPort instance causes temporary holdover, or the synchronization

reference to be changed.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

Using BFN Offset and Frame Start Offset Together

Using the BFN offset together with the

EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset or the

EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset can have a combining effect

when a positive RadioEquipmentClock.bfnOffset value is used.

Using the BFN offset together with the

EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset or the

EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset can have a canceling effect

when a negative RadioEquipmentClock.bfnOffset value is used.

The value of BFN offset must be zero for the following features to function:

- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X (FAJ 121 3056)
- LTE Broadcast (FAJ 121 3021)

Configuring BFN Offset on RAN PTP Grandmaster or Boundary Clock

In the PTP network, it is not recommended to configure

RadioEquipmentClock.bfnOffset on Baseband that is configured

as PTP grandmaster or PTP boundary clock. PTP grandmaster or boundary clock can be

configured when BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockType is

GRAND\_MASTER\_ORDINARY\_CLOCK or BOUNDARY\_CLOCK.

Otherwise subsequent PTP slaves connected to this PTP grandmaster or PTP boundary

clock can have offset twice or more. This can cause traffic disturbance and KPI

degradation.

## 9.1 Radio Equipment Clock

The network synchronization function is implemented in the Radio Equipment Clock, which

provides reference for air interface synchronization and for internal synchronization users in

the node. It generates the basic 10 ms radio frame tick and the basic radio frame counter.

The radio equipment clock is tailored for radio performance. It is built around a high

stability oscillator and has a synchronization algorithm that adjusts the time and frequency.

This enables it to lock quickly to the selected time or frequency reference, and to withstand

frequency and phase variations once locked. To enable short restart times, the parameters of

the adaptive algorithm are stored in a non-volatile memory.

During frequency synchronization, the high stability oscillator has a frequency within the

3GPP accuracy requirements from start, so when locking to a frequency synchronization

reference, there is no impact to the RAT executing on the node.

For time and phase synchronization, when locking to the reference, it might be required to

jump the basic frame counter of the Radio Equipment Clock to get in sync with the reference.

During the jump, the RAT cells are disabled to avoid network disturbances.

The radio equipment clock can be in the clock states FREQUENCY\_LOCKED,

RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED, or TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED when synchronized

to a reference. The TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED represents a state where the clock is

locked to the time reference, but waiting for a node internal request to jump the basic frame

counter. When the node synchronizes by jumping the basic frame counter, internal node

communication assures that cells are temporarily disabled during the synchronization

forlopp.

A basic radio frame counter jump can happen in the following events:

- When the node is configured for frequency synchronization, and it is reconfigured to use time synchronization and the applicable feature is enabled.
- When the node is configured for time synchronizationif all time synchronization references fail, the node goes to RNT\_TIME\_HOLDOVER, and then FREQUENCY HOLDOVER. When the failed time reference comes back and the time of the reference differs more than 10 μs from the basic frame counter time, the jump occurs.

This feature enhancement enables PTP on the IDLe ports and ensures synchronization distribution with PTP. The main benefit is that there is no

need for extra switches or TN for distributing synchronization references.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

From a synchronization perspective, the configuration of PTP on the IDLe port is identical to

the configuration of PTP for the TN ports. The PtpBcOcPort MO contains an ethernetPort MO, which contains a TN

port that represents the IDLe port.

This feature

introduces support for carrying  PTP packets over VLAN tagged

Ethernet.

The enhancement includes configuration parameters to enable or disable VLAN tagging.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The new MO

attribute, transportVlan is implemented to configure the VLAN ID

for each PTP port.

The tnPortId, attribute of the

TnPort MO indicates that a TN or an IDLe port is used for the

VLAN.

- When a TN port is used, a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO has to refer to the VlanPort MO.
- When an IDLe port is used, an ENodeBFunction MO instance has to be available, and the eranVlanPortRef attribute must refer to the same VlanPort MO instance as the PtpBcOcPort MO does. The operState attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO must be set to ENABLED before configuring the PtpBcOcPort MO that points to the same VlanPort MO instance.

PTP Source Instability Indication is an enhancement of the 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

feature. This enhancement introduces additional supervision of fast phase changes,

covering the currently selected PTP time reference. Other time references are not

supervised by this feature.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

When fast phase changes are detected twice in a time frame of 30 minutes, the selected PTP

reference is considered faulty and the Sync PTP Time PDV

Problem alarm is raised. If there is a backup frequency reference

on the node, it will maintain Time Holdover until it expires, and then switch to the

backup frequency reference.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                      |

Configuring time offset enables adjusting the BFN start time to be delayed or advanced.

The enhancement provides time offset configuration function for GNSS, PTP over Ethernet,

and PTP over IP time references. By setting a time offset, interference can be avoided

with other radio access and transport technologies, or with TDD networks already

deployed with a time offset.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the new

RadioEquipmentClock.bfnOffset MO attribute to support time

offset configuration.

Before configuring time offset, the configured offset in the GNSS Receiver Unit must

be removed. In the node group, all nodes that have a time reference must be

configured with the same BFN offset.

Using BFN offset together with EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset or

EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset can have a combining effect or

canceling effect.

The value of BFN offset must be zero for the following features to function:

- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X (FAJ 121 3056)
- LTE Broadcast (FAJ 121 3021)

Inconsistent time offset values between different eNBs can negatively impact the

performance of the following features or prevent them from working properly:

- OTDOA Control Plane Location Support (FAJ 121 1793)
- OTDOA User Plane Location Support (FAJ 121 0862)
- OTDOA PRS Management (FAJ 121 3086)
- Inter-Frequency OTDOA (FAJ 121 3090)
- Elastic RAN (FAJ 121 4608)
- Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation (FAJ 121 4469)
- Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception (FAJ 121 3043)

In the PTP network, it is not recommended to configure

RadioEquipmentClock.bfnOffset on Baseband that is configured

as PTP grandmaster or PTP boundary clock. For the full configuration procedure, see

the Configure Time Offset section in Manage Network

Synchronization, found in the Baseband Radio Node

library.

Configuring time offset enables adjusting the BFN start time to be delayed or advanced.

The enhancement provides time offset configuration function for GNSS, PTP over Ethernet,

and PTP over IP time references. By setting a time offset, interference can be avoided

with other radio access and transport technologies, or with TDD networks already

deployed with a time offset.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the new

Synchronization.bfnOffset MO attribute for DU Radio Nodes to

support time offset configuration.

Before configuring time offset, the configured offset in the GNSS Receiver Unit must

be removed. On DU Radio Nodes this is executed automatically when the

Synchronization.bfnOffset attribute is applied, if the GNSS

receiver is connected directly to the node. In the node group, all nodes that have a

time reference must be configured with the same BFN offset.

Using BFN offset together with EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset or

EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset can have a combining effect or

canceling effect.

The value of BFN offset must be zero for the following features to function:

- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X (FAJ 121 3056)
- LTE Broadcast (FAJ 121 3021)

Inconsistent time offset values between different eNBs can negatively impact the

performance of the following features or prevent them from working properly:

## Appendix A.j: 20.Q1: PTS with Relaxed Network Limits (Semi-Loose Time Synchronization)

Semi-loose time synchronization is a feature enhancement to IEEE 1588 Time and Phase

Synchronization. The enhancement enables nodes to operate within a time error of 500 µs.

Such an allowed time error is enabled by the configuration of the G.8275.2 PTP profile,

which is referred to as PTS, with relaxed limits.

The G.8275.2 PTP profile for time and phase synchronization with partial timing support

(PTS) from the network can be deployed in networks with poorer conditions than

recommended in ITU-T G.8271.2. The PTS has relaxed acceptable limits that

allow a higher time error and a higher PDV limit at the input to the base station. The

time error at the input to the base station must be below 500 µs. The relaxed PDV limit

is 600 µs, but this value must be lower at the input to the base station.

The result of the relaxed PTS limits is that the base stations are synchronized in time,

but the time error can be considerably above ±1.5 µs at the input to the base station.

Consequently, deploying the PTS profile in a network with poorer conditions can result

in a time alignment error at the air interface up to 500 µs, depending on the network

conditions. This increases the robustness of the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase

Synchronization feature.

Benefits

The benefit of using the G.8275.2 PTP profile with relaxed limits for node time

synchronization is that it removes the constraints on the operator in the following

areas:

- Where network conditions do not require strict time accuracy (&lt; ±0.5 ms).
- Where using other methods to ensure time synchronization requires additional investment in the network (for example, deploying GNSS or G.8275.1 PTP profile).

Capacity and Performance

The achieved time accuracy using G.8275.2 PTP (PTS) profile with relaxed limits is

appropriate for features running in EN-DC.

Operation

The following requirements must be met in order to use PTS with relaxed limits:

- The PtpBcOcPort.associatedGrandmaster attribute is set with either the IP address or the domain name of the grandmaster associated with the G.8275.2 PTP (PTS) profile.
- The BoundaryOrdinaryClock.ptpProfile attribute is set to G\_8275\_2.
- The PTS reference is encapsulated with the highest priorities. The value of the required priorities must be either 5 or 6.

The network conditions in which the PTS profile with relaxed limits can be used

require the relaxed PDV limit to be less than 600 µs at the input to the base

station. The PDV can be defined as a 99% confidence interval

(±

2.57 σ) of the delay variation in either downlink or

uplink where σ

represents standard deviation. The PDV is estimated over an

observation period or as a moving average value (depending on the application used).

The PDV value

used in supervision algorithm is measured as a moving average. The

standard deviation reported in the following PTP PM counters that measure delay in

downlink and uplink can give an approximation of the high frequency PDV:

- PM counters measuring delay in downlink: PtpBcOcPort.ptpDownLinkDelayAvg PtpBcOcPort.ptpDownLinkDelayMax PtpBcOcPort.ptpDownLinkDelayMin PtpBcOcPort.ptpDownLinkDelayStDev
- PM counters measuring delay in uplink: PtpBcOcPort.ptpUpLinkDelayAvg PtpBcOcPort.ptpUpLinkDelayMax PtpBcOcPort.ptpUpLinkDelayMin PtpBcOcPort.ptpUpLinkDelayStDev

The values of the PM counters need to be collected and checked for 24 hours.

Using the values of the PtpBcOcPort.ptpDownLinkDelayStDev and the

PtpBcOcPort.ptpUpLinkDelayStDev PM counters instead of the

allowed PDV limit can be used to describe network conditions suitable for deploying

the PTS profile in the following ways:

- In downlink, 5.14 × ptpDownLinkDelayStDev must be less than 600 µs.
- In uplink, 5.14 × ptpUpLinkDelayStDev must be less than 600 µs.

The standard deviation of the measured delay in downlink and uplink must be

less than

116 µs.

The PDV obtained from PTP PM counters does not match the exact values of PDV used in

supervision algorithm in some cases due to different observation

intervals.

Note: If PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute exists on Baseband Radio Node with a value of 1000 ns or higher, before upgrade to the latest software the attribute needs to be updated either with the new default value of 750 ns, or set the value in accordance with MOM description.

PTP Time reference may have static time error, for example due to asymmetry in network.

This can cause time discontinuity between neighboring nodes after switch from GNSS

reference to PTP Time reference.

Static time error of backup PTP Time references, in case the GNSS is active reference, is

measured and presented in PM counters.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Description of the following existing PM counters are updated:

- PtpBcOcPort.ptpOffsetFromMasterAvg: Average value of time offset.
- PtpBcOcPort.ptpOffsetFromMasterMax: Maximum value of time offset.
- PtpBcOcPort.ptpOffsetFromMasterMin: Minimum value of time offset.
- PtpBcOcPort.ptpOffsetFromMasterStDev: Standard deviation of time offset.

Counters representing the statistical measures of time offset value during

granularity period on Baseband Radio Node are updated.

When data is collected for active synchronization reference, counters present the

time offset from PTP grandmaster computed by the slave clock. If another

synchronization reference is active when data is collected, counters present the

time offset from the active synchronization reference.

The PtpBcOcPort.ptpValidMeasurement counter is used to determine

if the reference was active during data collection period.

For assisting synchronization reference, counters present the time offset between

active and assisting synchronization reference. When the assisting reference is

selected, counters present the offset measured at the time when the active reference

failed.

Benefits

PTS with relaxed network limits

allows

the

activation

and

deactivation

of PTP time reference with G.8275.2 profile without requiring the use of reference

priorities 5 or

6.

The enhancement also improves the observability of eNodeB and gNodeB. The

Sync Time and Phase Accuracy Too Low primary

alarm is

raised if there is a functionality that requires relaxed PTS time accuracy but that

synchronization precision cannot be achieved.

The ENodeBFunction.timePhaseSyncStateNr attribute

is introduced

to

provide

information on time and phase synchronization state of the LTE-NR inter-working. It

is set to false if any time and phase synchronization accuracy-dependent function is

degraded due to unfulfilled relaxed PTS time accuracy requirements, otherwise it is

set to true.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

PTS

with relaxed network limits is activated and deactivated

automatically.

The RadioEquipmentClockReference.priority attribute can have any

priority of the PTP time reference with G.8275.2 profile.

For eNodeB, the PTS network limits are automatically relaxed when used in the

following deployment scenarios:

- LTE FDD system in EN-DC
- LTE FDD system interworking with an NR SA

The ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment attribute must be

set to true for PTS with Relaxed Network Limits.

For gNodeB, the PTS network limits are automatically relaxed when used in the Low

Band FDD cell deployment scenario. For more information about PM counters and

information they provide, see IEEE 1588 Time and Phase

Synchronization.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the operation of a Baseband Radio Node synchronized

to the GNSS as a measurement device. The Baseband Radio Node is used for measuring

the characteristics of PTP references with G.8275.2 profile. It is according to the

metrics and network limits defined in the ITU-T G.8271.2 for reference point C of

network reference model. However, no defect or alarm is raised for the PTS or APTS

if the measured characteristics exceed the limits defined in ITU-T G.8271.2.

Regarding the planned deployment, PTS or APTS, different measurements are applicable.

The PtpProfileMeasurement.maxAbsPktSelected2WayTE attribute, or

the PtpProfileMeasurement.peak2peakPktSelected2WayTE attribute,

or both can be used for measuring.

This feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- No external measurement equipment or software is needed to perform PTP G.8275.2 network characteristics measurements and to present measurement results.
- Radio network planners receive more detailed information for dimensioning, optimizing, and configuring the network before PTP with G.8275.2 profile implementation.
- Better troubleshooting capability for inaccurate PTP with G.8275.2 profile references.
- Improved PTP performance observability for PTP with G.8275.2 profile references.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

To use this feature enhancement, the following requirements must be met:

- The GNSS must be configured as a primary synchronization source on the Baseband node. Note: The delay of the input 1PPS signal needs to be compensated by configuring the TimeSyncIO.compensationDelay attribute.
- The RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute must be set to RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED for at least 10 minutes.
- The BoundaryOrdinaryClock and PtpBcOcPort MO instances must be configured.
- The feature enhancement is configured by creating a PtpProfileMeasurement MO instance.

The measurements can be started or stopped by executing the following MO actions:

- PtpProfileMeasurement.startMeasurement
- PtpProfileMeasurement.stopMeasurement

The PtpProfileMeasurement.measurementDuration attribute is set to

10000 seconds by default. It is recommended to perform

measurements over a 24-hour interval, that is, 86,400 seconds.

If the Baseband radio node is synchronized to the PTS or APTS, the requirements

regarding GNSS are not met. To start using the feature enhancement in this case, the

following steps must be performed:

1. A PtpProfileMeasurement MO instance must be configured.
2. The GNSS must be configured as primary synchronization source.
3. The RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute must be set to RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED for at least 25 minutes.

The PtpProfileMeasurement MO is introduced to provide information

on the measurement process and results. The measurement results are shown in the

following attributes:

- PtpProfileMeasurement.maxAbsPktSelected2WayTE
- PtpProfileMeasurement.p2pPktSelected2WayTE

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the operation of a Baseband Radio Node synchronized

to the GNSS as a measurement device. The Baseband Radio Node is used for measuring

the characteristics of PTP references with G.8275.1 profile. It is according to the

metrics and network limits defined in ITU-T G.8271.1 for reference

point C of the network reference model.

However, no defect or alarm is raised for the reference if the measured

characteristics exceed the limits defined in ITU-T G.8271.1.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- No external measurement equipment or software is needed to perform PTP G.8275.1 network characteristics measurements and to present the measurement results.
- Radio network planners receive more detailed information for dimensioning, optimizing, and configuring the network before PTP with G.8275.1 profile installation.
- Better troubleshooting capability for inaccurate PTP with G.8275.1 profile references.
- Improved PTP performance observability for PTP with G.8275.1 profile references.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

To use this feature enhancement, the following requirements must be met:

- The GNSS must be configured as a primary synchronization source on the Baseband Radio Node. Note: The delay of the input 1PPS signal needs to be compensated by configuring the TimeSyncIO.compensationDelay attribute.
- The RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute must be set to RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED for at least 10 minutes.
- The BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockType attribute must be set to SLAVE\_ONLY\_ORDINARY\_CLOCK.
- The feature enhancement is configured by creating a PtpProfileMeasurement MO instance.
- The measurements can be started or stopped executing the following MO actions: PtpProfileMeasurement.startMeasurement PtpProfileMeasurement.stopMeasurement

The PtpProfileMeasurement.measurementDuration attribute is set to

10,000 seconds by default. It is recommended to perform measurements over a 24-hour

interval, that is, 86,400 seconds.

If the Baseband Radio Node is synchronized to the PTP reference, the requirements

regarding GNSS are not met. To start using the feature enhancement in this case, the

following steps must be performed:

1. A PtpProfileMeasurement MO instance must be configured.
2. The GNSS must be configured as a primary synchronization source.
3. The RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute must be set to RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED for at least 25 minutes.

The PtpProfileMeasurement MO is introduced to provide information

on the measurement process and results. The following attributes are used to see the

measurement results:

- PtpProfileMeasurement.maxAbsLowPassFilterTE
- PtpProfileMeasurement.maskMaxTimeIntervalError
- PtpProfileMeasurement.p2pHighPassFilterTE

The following PM counters are used by the ENIQ system to visualize the

measurements:

- PtpProfileMeasurement.ptpHighPassFilterTE
- PtpProfileMeasurement.ptpLowPassFilterTE
- PtpProfileMeasurement.ptpMtieLimit
- PtpProfileMeasurement.ptpMtieValue
- PtpProfileMeasurement.ptpPktSelected2wayTE

Summary and Benefits

The system improvement introduces PM counters to monitor time offset data

between the

PTP

as primary synchronization reference and

the

GNSS

as backup synchronization reference.

When

the

GNSS

is used as primary synchronization reference, the introduced PM counters monitor

time offset between the node clock and the GNSS source.

The system improvement has the following benefits:

- Observing trend changes in time offset values to troubleshoot and eliminate potential errors in accumulated time offset
- Enabling PM counters to measure time offset data without node restart or traffic disturbance regardless of the configured primary synchronization reference

Capacity and Performance

The system improvement introduces the following PM counters:

- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetActiveReference
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetAvg
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetMax
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetMin
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetStDev

Operation

To have the Baseband Radio

Node

time-locked to a primary synchronization reference,

the

value of the RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute must

be RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED.

The introduced PM counters are used in either of the following configuration

options:

- The Baseband Radio Node is time-locked to the PTP as primary synchronization reference and the GNSS as backup synchronization reference Note: For PTP reference, the value of the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockType attribute must be set to SLAVE\_ONLY\_ORDINARY\_CLOCK.
- The Baseband Radio Node is time-locked to the GNSS as primary synchronization reference.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this system improvement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
