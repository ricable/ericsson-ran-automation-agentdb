Summary

This feature enables the relaxation of

RRM

measurements for UEs and

RedCap UEs in

RRC\_IDLE

state or RRC\_INACTIVE state. UEs can

use

low-mobility and

not-at-cell-edge

RRM measurement relaxation methods. RedCap UEs can use the following

RRM measurement relaxation methods:

- Low-mobility
- Not-at-cell-edge
- Not-at-cell-edge while stationary
- Stationary

The configuration information for RRM measurement relaxation is included in

SIB2 for UEs in

RRC\_IDLE

state or RRC\_INACTIVE state.

RRM measurement relaxation allows UEs and RedCap UEs to reduce the number of RRM

measurements performed to

evaluate

the available radio resources,

which

improves UE power saving.

Hardware

This feature is supported on the RAN Compute units of the following RAN Compute

groups:

- RAN Compute group 4
- RAN Compute group 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d
- RAN Compute group 6

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To benefit fully from this feature, the UE must support RRM measurement relaxation in

RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE state.

# 3 Feature Operation of Relaxed Radio Resource Management Measurements

The

relaxation of RRM measurements can be adjusted through attributes.

Operation Methods of Relaxed Radio Resource Management Measurements

This feature allows UEs to use the low-mobility and

not-at-cell-edge

relaxation methods for RRM measurements, while RedCap UEs can use the

following relaxation methods, as defined in 3GPP TS 38.133:

- Low-mobility
- Not-at-cell-edge
- Not-at-cell-edge while stationary
- Stationary

The power and the quality of the serving cell signal are used to calculate the

RRM measurement relaxation method used by the UE. The RRM measurement relaxation

methods reduce the number of measurements made by UEs to improve UE power

savings.

Figure 1 shows the conditions for

low-mobility and stationary relaxation methods for UEs and RedCap UEs.

and Stationary RRM Relaxation Conditions

Table 2 shows the attributes used to

configure the conditions of low-mobility and stationary relaxation methods for UEs

and RedCap UEs.

RedCap UEs.

Table 3   Attributes for

Configuring

Not-At-Cell-Edge Relaxation Method

| Attribute Name                                         | Applicable for UE Type   |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.combineRelaxedMeasCondition  | RedCap UE, UE            |
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.highPriorityMeasRelax        | RedCap UE, UE            |
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.sSearchThresholdP            | RedCap UE, UE            |
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.sSearchThresholdQ            | RedCap UE, UE            |
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.combineRelaxedMeasCondition2 | RedCap UE                |
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.sSearchThresholdP2           | RedCap UE                |
| RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile.sSearchThresholdQ2           | RedCap UE                |

If the conditions for both the stationary and the not-at-cell-edge relaxation are

fulfilled, RedCap UEs can use the not-at-cell-edge while stationary

relaxation method. If the not-at-cell-edge while stationary relaxation method is

used, the attributes used in both the stationary and the not-at-cell-edge relaxation

methods can be used for the UEs.

Operational Process of Relaxed Radio Resource Management Measurements

This feature uses attributes under the RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile

MO class to configure the required values for RRM measurement relaxation conditions

for UEs. The attributes are configured on cell profile level and correspond to IEs

that are sent to

UEs

and RedCap UEs

in

SIB2.

Figure 3   Operational

Sequence Diagram of Relaxed Radio Resource Management Measurements

1. The conditions for RRM measurement relaxation are configured in the gNodeB through the NRCellCU.relaxedRrmMeasCellProfileRef attribute.
2. The gNodeB modifies the SIB2 content according to the configuration in the RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile MO class. The SIB2 includes the relaxedMeasurement-r16 or the relaxedMeasurement-r17 IE.
3. The UE continues to evaluate RRM measurements according to the configured relaxed conditions.

## 9.2 Configuration of Measurement Relaxation Conditions

It

is recommended to configure matching values for attributes to prevent unintended changes to

RRM measurement relaxation conditions.

This feature introduces the RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile MO class to

configure the conditions of RRM measurement relaxation for UEs. The attributes under the

RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile MO class depend on attributes under the

NRCellCU and NRFreqRelation MO classes.

The

reconfiguration of the

NRCellDU.ssbFrequency attribute changes which

NRFreqRelation MO instance is configured as intra-frequency.

The

attributes under the RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile MO class depend on the

NRFreqRelation MO instance configured as intra-frequency.

It

is recommended to match the configuration of the

NRFreqRelation MO instance and the attributes under the

RelaxedRrmMeasCellProfile MO class before the value of the

NRCellDU.ssbFrequency attribute is changed.
