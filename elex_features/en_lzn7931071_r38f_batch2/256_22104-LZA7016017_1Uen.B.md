# 1 NR Downlink Beam Optimizer Overview

The feature optimizes codebook-based beamforming on the PDCCH.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature introduces a backup codebook-based beamforming state to the existing

codebook-based beamforming fallback mechanism, and allows the configuration of the

fallback conditions for this enhanced backup mechanism. When the gNodeB receives a

successful CSI report while codebook-based beamforming is active, the report is

stored as a backup. The backup state relies on the backup CSI reports to prolong the

use of codebook-based beamforming on the PDCCH over common channel beamforming once

the fallback conditions are met.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Configurable conditions for the enhanced fallback mechanism
- Improved PDCCH CCE utilization and reduced PDCCH blocking
- Increased PDCCH robustness

Hardware

The feature is not supported on RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5e.

Limitations

of the enhanced fallback mechanism are only applicable to PCell.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Downlink Beam Optimizer

The feature improves the fallback mechanism of PDCCH beamforming and allows the

configuration of the fallback conditions.

The aim of the existing fallback mechanism of PDCCH beamforming is to provide continuous

UE connectivity by switching between codebook-based beamforming and common channel

beamforming. The feature enhances the fallback mechanism through a backup codebook-based

beamforming state and configurable conditions for the fallback mechanism.

When the gNodeB receives a successful CSI report while codebook-based beamforming is

active, the report is stored as a backup. The backup state relies on the stored CSI

reports to prolong the use of codebook-based beamforming on the PDCCH over common

channel beamforming.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Enhanced Fallback Mechanism

1. Each successful CSI report received by the gNodeB while codebook-based beamforming is active is stored as a backup.
2. If a fallback condition is met and the gNodeB has a valid backup CSI report stored, the gNodeB switches from codebook-based beamforming to the backup codebook-based beamforming state in both downlink and uplink for the PCell. If the stored backup CSI report os detected to be outdated, the gNodeB switches to common channel beamforming in both downlink and uplink.
3. The gNodeB switches back to codebook-based beamforming after the next successful CSI report.
