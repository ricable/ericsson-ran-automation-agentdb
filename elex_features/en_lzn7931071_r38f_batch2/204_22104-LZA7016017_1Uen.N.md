Summary

The feature provides enhanced SCell throughput and QoS support for inter-capacity module

carrier aggregation in scenarios where the E5 link latency between the SpCell

capacity modules and the SCell capacity modules is very short. The RTT delay must be

below a 35 µs threshold to use low-delay carrier aggregation over the E5 interface.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- The peak SCell throughput in external SCells matches the peak SCell throughput of local SCells.
- The QoS support for external SCells matches the QoS support for local SCells.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Carrier Aggregation Scheduling Optimization for External SCells

The feature uses the Advanced RAN Coordination feature for inter-Baseband carrier

aggregation. The feature requires an NR downlink carrier aggregation feature as a

prerequisite.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

- It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
- The UE must support downlink carrier aggregation as specified in 3GPP TS 38.101.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Carrier Aggregation Scheduling Optimization for External SCells

The feature provides optimized SCell scheduling if the external SCell partner is capable

of low-delay carrier aggregation.

During carrier aggregation partner setup, the SpCell partner performs initial RTT

measurements on the E5 interface towards an external SCell partner.

If the RTT delay is below the 35 µs threshold based on the initial measurements, the

SCell partner is capable of low-delay carrier aggregation and the feature can provide

optimized scheduling. The feature provides the same peak SCell throughput and QoS

support as local SCells.

If the RTT delay is above the 35 µs threshold, the SCell partner uses a high-delay

connection and regular external SCell scheduling is used.

Figure 1   Operational Process of NR Carrier Aggregation Scheduling Optimization for

External SCells

For carrier aggregation with three or more component carriers, UEs can be configured to

different SCell partner nodes that use different connection types. For example, a UE

that uses 3CC carrier aggregation can be configured to a low-delay SCell partner and

another high-delay SCell partner at the same time, as shown in Figure 2.

Counters

The feature introduces the following PM counters to indicate network conditions:

- GNBDUFunction.pmArcLinkDelayAboveCaSchedOptThres
- GNBDUFunction.pmArcPartnerSuspensionLinkDelay

The GNBDUFunction.pmArcLinkDelayAboveCaSchedOptThres PM counter

measures the aggregated number of Advanced RAN Coordination partners that do not

meet the E5 link delay requirement to support the NR Carrier Aggregation Scheduling

Optimization for External SCells feature. The PM counter is stepped when the RTT

link delay exceeds for each partner is over the threshold.

The GNBDUFunction.pmArcPartnerSuspensionLinkDelay PM counter

measures the aggregated number of Advanced RAN Coordination partners that are in

suspended state due to not meeting the E5 link delay requirement to set up a tunnel.

The PM counter is incremented in every slot when the link delay SCell partner

exceeds the 900 µs threshold. If this threshold is exceeded, E5 tunnels cannot be

set up.

The following counters can be used to observe the performance of the feature:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellExt
- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCellExt

The value of the following QoS-related PM counters in external SCells matches local

SCells where the PCell and SCell have the same QoS configurations:

- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbLastSlotQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQos
