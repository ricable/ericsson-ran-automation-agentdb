Summary

This feature enables the use of multiple PCells in each sector of an NR standalone High-Band

deployment. This increases the maximum number of supported UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED

state to 200 in each sector.

This feature uses the random redirect at release function to distribute UEs between

PCells that are in the same sector.

Hardware

This feature is supported on the following RAN Compute units:

- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 6

This feature is supported on the

following

radio units:

- AIR 1281
- AIR 5322
- AIR 5343

For information on supported configurations, see NR Flexible Cell Shaping High-Band.

Limitations

This feature has the following limitations:

- Dual connectivity is not supported.
- Only the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is supported.
- SCell sharing is not supported.
- The PCell and the related SCells must be in the same PAAM segment.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Standalone High-Band with Multiple PCell Support

This feature supports the use of two PCells in the same sector.

PCells

must be configured manually. To configure a cell as PCell, the

NRCellDU.secondaryCellOnly attribute must be set to

false. Both PCells must be enabled for uplink and downlink

transmissions. The first PCell must use the lowest ARFCN, while the second PCell must

use the highest ARFCN in the sector.

If two PCells are defined in the same sector, the PAAM must be split to enable the gNodeB

to select two

PCells.

Each PCell must be configured with three related SCells. A PCell and the related SCells

must be in the same PAAM segment to avoid SCell sharing.

The

PCells and their

related SCells can be scheduled in the same TTI. Therefore, two UEs

can be scheduled in the same TTI in both downlink and uplink.

For information on how to configure PCells in an NR standalone High-Band deployment, see

## 3.1 Random Redirect at Release

This function enables UE distribution.

The random redirect at release function enables UE distribution among PCells that are in

the same sector. UEs are distributed randomly among any number of frequencies, defined

by frequency relations, that are allowed to serve a PCell. Frequency relations indicate

that a referenced frequency can serve a PCell if the

UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell attribute is set

to true.

To enable the random redirect at release function, the

TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.actionAtRelease attribute must be set to

RANDOM\_REDIRECT.

UEs first connect to the PCell with the lowest ARFCN. When a UE is released, it must

connect to a PCell again later to access the High-Band service. In such cases, the UE is

randomly redirected to one of the available PCells, and it might reconnect to the PCell

with the lowest ARFCN again. Because of the randomness of the function, load

distribution is expected to be achieved over time.

For more information on traffic steering, see NR Traffic Steering.

Interfaces

This feature impacts the Uu interface by including the

RedirectedCarrierInfo IE in the RRCRelease message

more frequently.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Standalone High-Band with Multiple PCell Support

## 9.1 Configure Multiple PCells

The use of multiple PCells in the same sector can be enabled through an MO

attribute.

Prerequisites

- The NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access feature is activated.
- The NR Standalone High-Band with Multiple PCell Support feature is activated.
- Both uplink and downlink is enabled on the sector carriers of the PCells.
- The first PCell has the lowest ARFCN in the sector. The second PCell has the highest ARFCN in the sector.
- The PAAM is split to enable the selection of two PCells in the same sector.
- The PCells are configured as described in NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.secondaryCellOnly attribute to false on all PCells. This attribute controls the transmission of the SIB1 in the cell.

## 9.2 Configure Random Redirect at Release

The random redirect at release function can be configured through MO

attributes.

Prerequisites

- There are two PCells in the same sector.
- All frequencies of the PCells are referenced by NRFreqRelation MO instances.

Steps

1. Set the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.actionAtRelease attribute to RANDOM\_REDIRECT to enable the random redirect at release function. This step must be performed only for the TrStSaCellProfile MO instances that are referenced by an NRCellCU MO instance of a PCell where the random redirect at release function is intended to be used.
2. Set the UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell attribute to true. This step must be performed only for the UeMCNrFreqRelProfile MO instances that are referenced by an NRFreqRelation MO instance that points to PCell frequencies to which the UE can be redirected.
