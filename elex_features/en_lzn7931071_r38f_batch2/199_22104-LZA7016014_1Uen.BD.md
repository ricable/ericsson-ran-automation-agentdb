# 1 Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Responder Overview

The feature enables measuring the performance of the transport network, without external

equipment. This is accomplished with the help of a TWAMP controller placed in the transport

network.

Summary

The feature enables the Baseband Radio Node to act as one or more logical TWAMP Light with

stateful test session management. It ensures interoperability with different active

monitoring probe vendors, including Ericsson, and enables the computation of the

following:

- One-way packet loss
- Reordering
- Duplicating metrics

Figure 1   Example of a Measured Network Path

The TWAMP Initiator system measures the following metrics:

- Round-trip packet delay
- One-way inter-packet delay variation
- One-way packet loss
- One-way packet reordering
- One-way packet duplication

# 2 Dependencies of Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Responder

test traffic towards the TWAMP

responder.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

A TWAMP Light compatible controller must be installed in the network to send TWAMP

test traffic towards the TWAMP responder. For more information about TWAMP Light

compatible controllers, see TWAMP Initiator.

# 3 Feature Operation of Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Responder

A TWAMP session can be set up for one DSCP value to monitor the end-to-end path for a

QoS in class over a transport network.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

## 3.1 TWAMP Responder Session

A TWAMP responder session supports the session reflector functionality using

authenticated mode communications.

The authenticated mode communications are specified in RFC 5357, Section

4.2.

A TWAMP responder session is identified by the unique combination

of the following attributes of received TWAMP packets:

- Source IP address
- Source UDP port
- Destination IP address (the responder IP address)
- Destination UDP port (the responder UDP port)

A new TWAMP responder session is started when a TWAMP test packet is received with the unique

combination of the attributes, for which there is no existing TWAMP session. If a TWAMP test

packet for a new TWAMP session is received, and the maximum number of TWAMP sessions is

reached, the packet is discarded.

A TWAMP responder session terminates if it does not receive any packets for the session in

900 seconds.

The packet sequence number increases when a packet is transmitted from the reflector in

response to a packet received from the session-sender. The reflector maintains a separate TSN

for each test session.

## 3.2 TWAMP Responder Session Characteristics

The characteristics of the test packets depend on the node type.

The DSCP of the reflected test packet is the same as the received test packet. If any of the

lower layers have a DSCP remapping policy, this policy overrides the DSCP of the received test

packet. Lower layers include:

- IP
- VLAN
- Ethernet

The same padding is used in each reflected test packet. The session-reflector truncates the

27 highest number of octets. The length of the reflected test packet is of the same length as

the received test packet.

The session-reflector discards received packets with a padding of less than 27 octets, that

is, with a total length lower than 41 octets, as described in RFC 5357, Section

4.1.2.

The TWAMP test traffic originating from the node is subject to the same transmission queues

used for actual traffic.

The maximum number of TWAMP responders supported in the node is 60.

Each TWAMP responder can handle up to 32 active TWAMP responder

sessions.

The TWAMP responder is supported on any IP address in the node.
