Hardware

This feature is supported on CPRI FDD radio units.

For the set of radios supported in SDL bands, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

Limitations

The downlink-only configuration is not allowed for Mid-Band deployments.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Downlink-Only Cell Support for Carrier Aggregation

This feature enables the configuration of downlink-only cells in the Low-band

including the Supplementary Downlink band where only the downlink spectrum is

available.

In downlink-only cells, there is no uplink channel available for UE to transmit towards

the gNodeB. Since uplink transmission is not possible, UEs cannot attach to these cells.

Therefore, downlink-only cells can only be used as SCells in downlink carrier

aggregation configurations where a bidirectionbal FDD or TDD carrier acts as an

SpCell.

The GUtranSyncSignalFrequency MO needs to be manually created for

downlink-only cells in the eNodeB for the EN-DC configuration.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Downlink-Only Cell Support for Carrier Aggregation

This feature improves single UE peak throughput.

Capacity and Performance

This feature increases single downlink UE peak throughput because of the additional

carrier.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Downlink-Only Cell Support for Carrier Aggregation

This feature affects multiple attributes.
