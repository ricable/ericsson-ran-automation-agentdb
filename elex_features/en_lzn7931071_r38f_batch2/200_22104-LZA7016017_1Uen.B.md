Summary

This feature allows for an enhanced throughput observability in uplink by introducing the

possibility to monitor traffic scheduling on DRB level. This is applicable for

Low-Band and Mid-Band cells.

With this feature, throughput observability is supported through EBS flexible counters and PM

events with support for filtering based on the following properties:

- PLMN identifier
- 5QI
- S-NSSAI
- UE group identifier

This feature provides the following benefits:

- It is possible to monitor DRBs with different scheduling priorities.
- It is possible to analyze the service performance of each QoS class.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR QoS-Aware Throughput Observability

This feature provides uplink throughput observability for each DRB.

Uplink throughput is measured when the traffic scheduling for the UE is restricted by the

available bandwidth and it takes more than one grant to empty the buffer. The

measurement is done based on the volume of the scheduled data and the time interval of

the data scheduling.

The following properties are not considered in the measurement:

- The last scheduling slot of the transmission that empties the buffer
- Retransmissions

Measurements can be filtered by the following selection criteria:

- PLMN identity
- 5QI
- S-NSSAI
- UE group identifier

The measurement of the volume of the scheduled data and the time interval of the data

scheduling with the following EBS flexible counters are reported periodically every 10

seconds:

- pmEbsnMacVolUlResDrb
- pmEbsnMacTimeUlResDrb

The measurement with the following PM events, which are reported periodically every second, can

be extended to 10-seconds and 60-seconds reports:

- DuPerUeRbTrafficRep
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr10
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr60

To track the throughput of a specific DRB, it is recommended to configure the DRB to

report on a separate LCG. If more than one DRB is mapped to the same LCG, the sum of

scheduled data volumes of all DRBs in the LCG transmitted over a time interval is

reported on the DRB with the highest priority.
