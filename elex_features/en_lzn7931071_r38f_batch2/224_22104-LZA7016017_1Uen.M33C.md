Limitations

For AIR 3219 B42, when using the High Sidelobe Suppression option (used though the

CommonBeamforming.cbfMacroTaperType attribute), the digital

tilt must not exceed 10 degrees, since the sidelobe suppression cannot be

guaranteed.

For the supported digital tilt configurations for AIR 3219 B42, see

Digital Tilt, RET, and HSLS RET Pairing for AIR 3219 B42

in

Manage Hardware Equipment.

Some parameters that are introduced by and related to this feature are restricted.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Flexible Cell Shaping Low/Mid-Band

With this feature, non-default coverage shapes can be selected and the coverage area

can be moved for optimal coverage.

The configurable cell shape allows for coverage control, interference reduction, and

better power utilization.

The coverage shape is improved through beamforming in the horizontal dimensions. The

coverage shape can be configured through the

CommonBeamforming.azimuthCoverageWidth attribute.

Inconsistent configurations of the

CommonBeamforming.azimuthCoverageWidth,

CommonBeamforming.elevationCoverageWidth,

and CommonBeamforming.usedDigitalPan attributes or attribute

combination raise the MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment

alarm.
