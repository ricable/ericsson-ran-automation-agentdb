Summary

The Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature enables UE battery power saving by the

deactivation of SCells in High-Band on the MAC layer during low data traffic. The

automatic activation and deactivation of SCells are based on both downlink and

uplink data traffic activity.

# 2 Dependencies of Dynamic Component Carrier Management

The activation of the NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature is required for

the Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature to take effect.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dynamic Component Carrier Management

The feature controls the activation and deactivation of SCells using three states,

which depend on the uplink and the downlink buffer estimates.

The Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature controls the activation and deactivation

of SCells. The feature state itself does not impact the initial activation of the SCells

of the related carrier aggregation features. Only the ability to save UE battery by

dynamically deactivating SCells is impacted by the feature state.

The feature uses the following states of activated cells:

- A state with only the SpCell activated
- An intermediate state with four cells activated
- A state with all SCells activated

The intermediate state is only applicable if at least four cells are configured

and then the configured uplink cells are included in the intermediate state.

The activation of SCells is performed if the SpCell capacity is not sufficient to serve

the downlink or the uplink data need. The downlink criteria for activating SCells are

based on the downlink buffer size compared to the capacity of the currently activated

cells. The uplink criteria for activating SCells depend on the uplink buffer estimates

and on the power headroom reported by the UE. The deactivation of SCells is triggered

after a given time when both the downlink and the uplink throughput need is evaluated to

be handled efficiently on fewer carriers.

The feature does not run during UAI overheating, as SCells are

deactivated. The feature starts again when the UAI overheating is mitigated.

Operational Process

The following states exist in the feature with activated and deactivated SCells:

| 1CC State     |    | All SCells are deactivated when the SpCell is evaluated to be able to                                 serve both the uplink and the downlink data need efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Instead of the immediate activation of all SCells, only the PSCell is active at first.

The SCells are activated only if the PSCell cannot deliver the needed throughput.

Capacity and Performance

UE power consumption is optimized based on the amount of downlink data that is needed

to be transferred.

Operation

The activation and deactivation of the SCells depend on the amount of data in the

downlink buffer.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 23.Q4: Intermediate State in Dynamic Component Carrier Management

The feature enhancement introduces an

intermediate state of four activated cells in High-Band for the Dynamic Component Carrier

Management feature.

| Impact at Upgrade:      | Mandatory                              |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature to

use an intermediate state between activating all SCells and deactivating all SCells.

In this intermediate state, four cells can remain activated when the traffic is low,

but more than one carrier is needed. The intermediate state is only applicable if

there are more than three SCells configured.

Depending on the data need, the feature can switch between the following states:

| 1CC State     |    | All SCells are deactivated when the SpCell is evaluated to be able to                                 serve both the uplink and the downlink data need efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 4CC State     |    | This is the intermediate state where the SpCell and three SCells are                                 activated. This state is available if more than four cells are                                 configured towards the UE. It is triggered if there is a need for                                 uplink carrier aggregation, or a need for two to four downlink                                 carriers. |

| All CCs State |    | The SpCell and all SCells are activated. This state is triggered when                                 four or more downlink cells are configured, and a need for downlink                                 or uplink carrier aggregation.                                                                                                                                                                       |

The feature enhancement is beneficial for reducing UE battery consumption, depending

on data traffic activity.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement can decrease the battery power consumption of the UE,

depending on data traffic activity.

There are no PM counters introduced by this feature enhancement, but the

NRCellDU.pmMacSchedSlotDlSCellActivatedDistr can be used to

observe the feature and is expected to show four activated cells more often after

introducing the feature enhancement.
