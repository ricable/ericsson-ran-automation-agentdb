# 1 Priority-Based Paging Access Overview

This feature improves the prioritization of UEs in idle state based on the paging

priority of mobile-terminating access.

Summary

This feature improves the admission and preemption functions of gNodeBs to recognize

UEs with requested priorities. This reduces the number of rejected priority

mobile-terminating access calls.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved network capabilities to establish priority mobile-terminating access calls
- Improved user experience

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of Priority-Based Paging Access

This feature enables paging to be used in the evaluation of priority during UE

Admission Control Function 1 and UE Admission Control Function 2.

The core network sends the paging priority information to the gNodeB in the NGAP

PAGING message, which stores the information for a configurable period.

Operational Process

In UE Admission Control Function 1, the paging priority of the UE is compared to the

value of the AdmissionControl.pagingPrioThreshold attribute. The

UE is considered as prioritized if the value of the paging priority is equal to or

lower than the value of the AdmissionControl.pagingPrioThreshold

attribute.

In UE Admission Control Function 2, the paging priority of the UE is compared to the

value of the &lt;pagingPrio&gt; variable in the selection criteria. The

selection criteria is defined when the UE group evaluation is performed during the

time period configured through the value of the

UeGroupSelection.validityTimePagingPrio attribute.

# 4 Network Impact of Priority-Based Paging Access

This feature can impact network capacity and performance.

Capacity and Performance

If there is a high number of NGAP PAGING messages with a high amount

of paging priority information, the load on the main processor can increase.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Priority-Based Paging Access

# 6 Performance of Priority-Based Paging Access

This feature introduces a new PM counter and uses existing PM and EBS counters to

observe its performance.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following EBS counters can be used to observe the change in the number of failed

admissions for mobile-terminating access by filtering for establishment cause or

paging priority:

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Priority-Based Paging Access

## 9.1 Configuration of Paging Priority for UE Admission Control Function 1

The configuration of the AdmissionControl.pagingPrioThreshold

attribute defines which RRC messages are prioritized based on the received paging

priority value.

The value of the AdmissionControl.pagingPrioThreshold attribute can be

set to a value of 1-8, where 1

indicates the highest paging priority and 8 indicates the lowest paging

priority.

The paging priority of the UE is compared to the value of the

AdmissionControl.pagingPrioThreshold attribute. The UE is

prioritized if the value of the paging priority is lower than or equal to the value

configured through the AdmissionControl.pagingPrioThreshold

attribute.

## 9.2 Configuration of Paging Priority for UE Admission Control Function 2

Configuring any of the following attributes with the &lt;pagingPrio&gt;

variable allows the UE Grouping Framework function to check for paging priority:

- PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria
- UeAdmissionGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria
- UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria
- UeMobilityGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria
- UeServiceGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria

The configured paging priority remains valid for the time configured through the

UeGroupSelection.validityTimePagingPrio attribute.
