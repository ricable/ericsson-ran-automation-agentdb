Summary

This feature allows the NR Traffic Steering feature to consider and prioritize handover to

cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs that are valid mobility targets, but are

not identified as valid candidates for the Multi-Layer Coordination function. These

cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs are prioritized by the Multi-Layer

Coordination function when taking decisions about PCell change. This feature

initiates handover even when there are no ongoing PCell change decisions if the

Multi-Layer Coordination function finds a cell that belongs to an other vendor

gNodeB.

Cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs are non-Ericsson external cells on a referenced NR

frequency for a given PCell for UEs matching the UE group profile of the referenced

NR frequency relation.

This feature deals with cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs only.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature can only detect and prioritize cells that

belong to other vendor gNodeB in PCell change decisions if other Ericsson cells are

available on the same frequency that are valid candidates for traffic steering.

The performance of the NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature might be reduced when

cells that belong to other vendor gNodeB are overlapped by other Ericsson cells on

other capacity frequency layers.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Small Cell Traffic Steering

This feature introduces support for the NR Traffic Steering feature to prioritize

handovers to valid mobility target cells that are not valid candidates for the Multi-Layer

Coordination function.

When the NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature is activated, the following functions of

the NR Traffic Steering feature consider cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs

during PCell change decisions:

- Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility
- Multi-Layer Coordination

The NR Traffic Steering feature handles cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs that

are reported by A5 measurements initiated by the Multi-Layer Coordination function.

These cells are also prioritized over other Multi-Layer Coordination candidate cells for

handover if the feature is activated.

The NR Small Cell Traffic Steering Feature Is Not Operational

Figure 1   NR Small Cell Traffic Steering Is Not Operational

Cell 1 and Cell 2 are Ericsson cells that are valid for traffic steering.

Cell 3 is a cell that belongs to another vendor gNodeB.

If the NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature is deactivated and the UE continuously

moves away from the antenna, the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function

operates in the following way:

1. The UE is connected to TDD Cell 1 from RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE state. When the periodic interval elapses, no Multi-Layer Coordination measurements are performed because the UE is already in the best cell set.
2. If the UE enters poor PCell coverage for TDD Cell 1, an inter-frequency NR Mobility handover is performed to FDD Cell 2 as PCell. A blind SCell Selection is performed to TDD Cell 1 as SCell. When the periodic interval elapses, no Multi-Layer Coordination measurements are performed because the UE is already in the best cell set.
3. When the periodic interval elapses, the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function starts a Multi-Layer Coordination procedure, which detects the coverage of TDD Cell 3. Cell 3 is a cell that belongs to another vendor gNodeB, therefore, it is not considered as valid candidate cell for traffic steering. The UE remains with Cell 1 as the configured SCell.

The NR Small Cell Traffic Steering Feature Is Operational

Figure 2   NR Small Cell Traffic Steering Is Operational

Cell 1 and Cell 2 are Ericsson cells that are valid for traffic steering.

Cell 3 is a cell that belongs to another vendor gNodeB.

When the UE continuously moves away from the antenna, the Dynamic Cell Set Change

during Mobility function operates in the following way:

1. The UE is connected to TDD Cell 1 from RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE state. When the periodic interval elapses, no Multi-Layer Coordination measurements are performed because the UE is already in the best cell set.
2. When the UE enters poor PCell coverage for TDD Cell 1, an inter-frequency NR Mobility handover is performed to FDD Cell 2 as PCell. A blind SCell Selection is performed to TDD Cell 1 as SCell. When the periodic interval elapses, no Multi-Layer Coordination measurements are performed because the UE is already in the best cell set.
3. When the periodic interval elapses, the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function starts a Multi-Layer Coordination procedure, which detects the coverage of TDD Cell 3. Cell 3 is a cell that belongs to another vendor gNodeB and it is considered as a valid candidate cell for traffic steering. Handover is performed to TDD Cell 3.

A cell can only be prioritized at the traffic steering PCell change decisions when

the following conditions are all fulfilled:

- The cell is configured in the gNodeB with an ExternalNrCellCU MO instance.
- Handover from the current cell set of the UE to the other cell is possible.
- The cell belongs to another vendor gNodeB.
- The gNodeBs are connected through the Xn interface.
- The TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.hoToPrioritizedCell attribute is set to true.
- The carrier frequency of the cell matches the carrier frequency of other cells that are considered as valid PCell candidates by the NR Traffic Steering feature. For more information, see NR Traffic Steering.

## 3.1 UE Group Support for NR Small Cell Traffic Steering

The NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature is adapted to the UE Grouping

Framework.

The TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.hoToPrioritizedCell attribute that is

used by this feature belongs to MO classes that are adapted to the UE Grouping

Framework.

The TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.hoToPrioritizedCell attribute is read

from an MO instance that is selected based on the UE group that the UE belongs to.

The UE group support for this function is controlled by the User- and Service-Specific

Mobility feature. If the license of this feature is not activated, configuration data is

always taken from the Base MO instances of the MO classes to which

the listed attributes belong.

For more information on the User- and Service-Specific Mobility feature license

activation, see User- and Service-Specific Mobility.

## 3.2 Other Vendor gNodeB Cells Overlapped by Multi-Layer Coordination Candidates

The NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature can detect cells that belong to other

vendor gNodeBs.

The ability of the NR Small Cell Traffic Steering feature to detect cells that belong to

other vendor gNodeBs might be reduced when these cells are overlapped by Ericsson cells

on other frequency layers.

Figure 3   Other Vendor gNodeB Cell Overlapped by Multi-Layer Coordination

Candidates

Cells 1, 2, 3, and 5 are Ericsson cells and are valid for traffic steering.

Cell 4 is a cell that belongs to another vendor gNodeB.

When the periodic interval elapses, the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function

starts a Multi-Layer Coordination procedure.

Since Cell 1 is a 100-MHz TDD cell, it is considered by the Multi-Layer Coordination

function as the best PCell candidate for the UE.

The A5 PCell measurement on Cell 1 is set up, but the UE reports Cell 5 instead of Cell

1. The next Multi-Layer Coordination iteration is started, where Cell 5 is the PCell

candidate. Eventually the Multi-Layer Coordination function initiates PCell change to

Cell 5.

Since Cell 4 is overlapped with the Cell 5 of a higher estimated throughput, which is

prioritized by the Multi-Layer Coordination function, the frequency measurements of Cell

4 are not performed.

## 3.3 Interaction with NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination

The NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature can affect the performance of the NR

Small Cell Traffic Steering feature.

The NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature allows the Multi-Layer Coordination

function to consider downlink cell load when choosing the best candidate cell set for

the UE.

High load in all Ericsson inter-frequency neighbor cells that share a carrier frequency

with cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs might reduce the ability of the NR Small

Cell Traffic Steering feature to hand over UEs to cells that belong to other vendor

gNodeBs.

Figure 4 shows how the NR Advanced Multi-Layer

Coordination feature can affect the performance of the NR Small Cell Traffic Steering

feature.

Figure 4   NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination with NR Small Cell Traffic

Steering

At periodic interval, the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function starts the

Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination procedure.

Since Cell 1 has high load, and there is no other inter-frequency neighbor with lower

load, the Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination function cannot find a better cell set that

improves UE throughput. Therefore, no UE measurements are performed and the Advanced

Multi-Layer Coordination procedure stops. In this case, the TDD frequency is not

measured, and the cell that belongs to another vendor gNodeB is not detected.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Small Cell Traffic Steering

This feature might improve UE throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cells that belong to other vendor gNodeB might provide better UE performance in

comparison to the loaded coverage layer cells.

Mobility to cells that belong to other vendor gNodeB offloads the coverage layer

cells. This results in improved capacity of the source cell.

The number of outgoing inter-gNodeB handovers might increase if the feature is

activated.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
