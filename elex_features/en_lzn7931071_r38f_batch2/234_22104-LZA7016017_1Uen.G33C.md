Summary

The NR Service Admission Control feature enables the configuration of PDU session and QoS flow

limits. After reaching the configured limits, new PDU sessions and QoS flows are

rejected.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Maintaining the performance of established traffic
- Reducing the impact of high priority traffic on low priority traffic

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service Admission Control

Requests to establish further PDU sessions or QoS flows are rejected after reaching

the configured limits.

This feature enables the configuration of PDU session and QoS flow limits for traffic set

members.

## 3.1 Service Admission

The following limits can be configured:

- The maximum number of PDU sessions for each traffic set member Note: The limit for PDU sessions can only be configured in NR standalone deployment.
- The maximum number of QoS flows for each traffic set member Note: The limit for QoS flows can only be configured in NR standalone and EN-DC deployments.

The configured limits for PDU sessions and QoS flows are checked during the following

procedures:

- UE Context Setup
- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify

If the number of PDU sessions or QoS flows reaches the configured limit in the traffic

set member, new PDU sessions and QoS flows are rejected.

## 3.2 Traffic Set Classification

Traffic set members can be defined with the following values:

- PLMN ID
- S-NSSAI
- SPID
- RFSP
- Deployment type

Traffic set members for PDU sessions can be defined with the following values:

- PLMN ID
- S-NSSAI

Traffic set members for QoS flows can be configured in NR standalone and EN-DC

deployments.

In NR standalone deployment, traffic set members can be configured with the same set of

the following values:

- PLMN ID
- S-NSSAI
- RFSP

In EN-DC deployment, traffic set members can be configured with the same set of the

following values:

- PLMN ID
- SPID

Limits on a cell level for one or more 5QI values can be configured with a different set

of the required values.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service Admission Control

This feature can impact several KPIs.

Capacity and Performance

This feature can degrade accessibility and mobility KPIs when protecting ongoing

traffic, depending on the configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 25.Q2.0: MOM Restructuring for NR Service Admission Control

This feature enhancement introduces a new MOM structure for the NR Service Admission

Control feature.

| Feature Name           | NR Service Admission Control   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5693                   |
| Value Package Name     | Advanced RAN Slicing           |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4019                   |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node            |
| Access Type            | NR                             |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                      |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces a new MOM structure for the configuration of the

NR Service Admission Control feature and deprecates the current MOM structure.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

GNBDUFunction.trafficDefinitionDepHEnabled attribute to

enable deprecation handling. The value of the

GNBDUFunction.trafficDefinitionDepHEnabled attribute is set

to true by default.

This feature enhancement deprecates the following MO classes:

- TrafficGroup
- TrafficGroups
- TrafficGroupMember

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO classes to replace the

deprecated MO classes:

- TrafficDefinition
- TrafficDefinitions
- TrafficSet
- TrafficSetMember

This feature enhancement deprecates the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.trafficGroupRef
- TrafficGroups.trafficGroupsId
- TrafficGroup.reservedBy
- TrafficGroup.trafficGroupId
- TrafficGroupMember.pLMNIdList
- TrafficGroupMember.sessionLimitRef
- TrafficGroupMember.sNSSAIList
- TrafficGroupMember.spidRfspList
- TrafficGroupMember.trafficCategory
- TrafficGroupMember.trafficGroupMemberId

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes to replace the

deprecated attributes:

- NRCellDU.trafficDefinitionRef
- TrafficDefinitions.trafficDefinitionsId
- TrafficDefinition.reservedBy
- TrafficDefinition.trafficDefinitionId
- TrafficSet.sessionLimitRef
- TrafficSet.trafficSetId
- TrafficSetMember.pLMNIdList
- TrafficSetMember.sNSSAIList
- TrafficSetMember.spidRfspList
- TrafficSetMember.trafficCategory
- TrafficSetMember.trafficSetMemberId

If the GNBDUFunction.trafficDefinitionDepHEnabled attribute is set

to true, updating any of the attributes under the

TrafficGroupMember MO class also updates the corresponding

attributes under the TrafficSet and the

TrafficSetMember MO classes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.2 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
