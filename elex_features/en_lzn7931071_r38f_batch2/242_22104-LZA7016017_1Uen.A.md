Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Flexible UE Grouping for Limited Capability UEs

This feature can be used for grouping PCell-only UEs.

This feature enables the use of the pCellOnlyUe selection criteria

variable. This selection criteria variable checks the Low-Band and Mid-Band PCell-only

capability of UEs in the NR-UE-Capability IE.

The pCellOnlyUe selection criteria variable evaluates to

true during UE group evaluation if the following

conditions are fulfilled:

- The cell group role of the UE variable is MCG.
- The UE does not support carrier aggregation.
- This feature is activated.

# 4 Network Impact of Flexible UE Grouping for Limited Capability UEs

This feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Flexible UE Grouping for Limited Capability UEs

This feature introduces the pCellOnlyUe selection criteria

variable.
