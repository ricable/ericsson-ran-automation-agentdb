Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Macro Positioning Information in Traces

This feature enables UE-level tracking of NR Timing Advance measurements with high

resolution and uplink AoA measurements.

This feature uses the DuPerRadioUeMeasurement PM event for UE-level monitoring of NR

Timing Advance measurements with high resolution and uplink AoA measurements.

Information on NR Timing Advance measurements with high resolution is always available in

the PM event. Information on uplink AoA measurements is updated only if the Uplink Angle

of Arrival for Macro Positioning feature is enabled and operable. In addition, the

NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message is received by the

gNodeB with uplink AoA measurement request. Otherwise, the value 0 is

shown in the PM event.

# 4 Network Impact of Macro Positioning Information in Traces

This feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of Macro Positioning Information in Traces

NR Timing Advance measurements provide a rough indication of the distance between the UE

and the cell antenna. Uplink AoA measurements provide a rough indication of the UE

direction. This makes it possible to identify where the UE is located at a certain time

and correlate the UE position information with other collected information for

statistical use.

# 5 Parameters for Macro Positioning Information in Traces

# 8 Deactivate Macro Positioning Information in Traces

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites
