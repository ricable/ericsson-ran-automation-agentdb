Hardware

This feature is applicable to RAN Compute units in RAN Compute groups 4 and 5.

For more information on RAN Compute groups, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Limitations

The feature only performs measurements for UEs that are in RRC\_CONNECTED state and

have a PDU session configured.

The maximum number of simultaneously positioned UEs for each Capacity Module is

100.

The maximum configurable periodicity for NR Timing Advance and uplink AoA

measurements is 20,480 ms.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

The 5GC needs to support the NRPPa protocol version 17.2.0.

# 3 Feature Operation of Periodic Measurements for Macro Positioning

This feature allows the initiation of periodic UE measurements in the NRPPa-based

E-CID positioning method.

The LMF can initiate periodic measurement requests to determine the UE location if the

NRCellCU.advUePosMode attribute is set to a value other than

NONE.

Operational Process of Periodic E-CID Measurement

Figure 1   Periodic E-CID Measurement

1. The LMF sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message to the gNodeB. This message contains the following information: Request for periodic measurement reporting set in the Report Characteristics IE. Request for one of the following measurement options set in the Measurement Quantities IE: NR Timing Advance NR Timing Advance and uplink AoA Measurement periodicity set in the following IEs depending on the requested measurements: If NR Timing Advance measurement is requested, the measurement periodicity is set in the Measurement Periodicity IE. If NR Timing Advance measurement is requested together with uplink AoA measurement, the measurement periodicity is set in the Measurement Periodicity NR-AoA IE.
2. The gNodeB receives the measurement request.
    - The gNodeB accepts the measurement request if it is able to initiate the measurements, and it sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message to the LMF.
    - The gNodeB rejects the measurement request if it is not able to initiate the measurements, and it sends back the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message to the LMF. The measurement request can be rejected because of the following reasons: The prerequisite feature is not activated. The value of the NRCellCU.advUePosMode attribute is set to NONE. Only uplink AoA measurements are requested. The maximum number of simultaneously positioned UEs for each Capacity Module is exceeded. The maximum configurable periodicity for NR Timing Advance and uplink AoA measurements is exceeded. The configured periodicitiy for NR Timing Advance and uplink AoA measurements is not supported by NRPPa protocol 3GPP TS 38.455 version 17.2.0. The requirements for the combined periodicity mode, set through the COMB\_PERIODICITY value of the GNBCUCPFunction.advUePosPeriodicityMode attribute, are not fulfilled. The UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state and it does not reply to the RAN paging procedure. No PDU session is established for the UE. A UE release or handover procedure is started for the UE.
3. Depending on the availability of measurement information, the gNodeB sends the following messages:
    - The gNodeB periodically sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message to the LMF with the requested measurement information, and the process proceeds to step 4.
    - The gNodeB sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION message to the LMF if the node is not able to report any of the requested measurement information.
4. The LMF estimates the UE location based on the measurement information.
5. Periodic measurement reporting is stopped and UE measurements are deconfigured if the gNodeB receives the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT TERMINATION COMMAND message from the LMF.

# 4 Network Impact of Periodic Measurements for Macro Positioning

This feature can affect the number of supported RRC-connected UEs and uplink cell

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Reporting might be delayed compared with the requested reporting periodicity in case

of high network load and many measurement requests.

The number of supported RRC-connected UEs and uplink cell throughput might decrease

with many frequent measurement requests and short requested reporting

periodicity.

Interfaces

NRPPa protocol 3GPP TS 38.455 version 17.2.0 or later is required for

this feature to be operable. For more information, see Compliance and Compatibility.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of Periodic Measurements for Macro Positioning

This feature allows the LMF to initiate UE measurements for positioning purposes. The

measurement results are reported to the LMF, where the UE positioning is calculated.

The gNodeB provides measurement data to the LMF with messages that can be used to

estimate the location of the target UE. The UE position is defined based on the NR

Timing Advance and uplink AoA information if requested and supported.

# 5 Parameters for Periodic Measurements for Macro Positioning

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Periodic Measurements for Macro Positioning

This feature introduces periodicity modes, which can affect the time intervals

between two subsequent measurement reports.

According to the value set in the

GNBCUCPFunction.advUePosPeriodicityMode attribute, the following

periodicity modes can affect the time intervals between two subsequent measurement

reports:

- If combined periodicity mode is set through the COMB\_PERIODICITY value, the measurement periodicity must meet the following conditions: Uplink AoA measurements must be requested with the same measurement periodicity as NR Timing Advance measurements. The measurement periodicity must be set to one of the following values: 640 ms 5120 ms 10,240 ms 20,480 ms If these conditions are not fulfilled, the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message is sent to the LMF.
- If periodicity mode for uplink AoA is set through the AOA\_PERIODICITY value, the measurement periodicity set for uplink AoA measurements is used for NR Timing Advance measurements, regardless of the periodicity set for them.
