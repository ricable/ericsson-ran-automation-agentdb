Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

The measurement of uplink throughput is only supported

per UE, not

per

DRB.

Network Requirements

No specific network

requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

The feature manages automatic updating of the resource share of

partitions.

When the feature is active, the gNodeB collects average downlink and uplink throughput

data of the last 10 seconds. Using this data together with the performance targets

configured by the NR Radio Resource Partitioning feature, the resource shares are

adjusted. If current performance in a partition is lower than the target performance,

resource share is increased. If current performance in a partition is higher than the

target performance, resource share is

decreased.

# 4 Network Impact of Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

The feature impacts the capacity and the performance of the

network.

Capacity and Performance

Dynamically changing resource shares provide increased resource efficiency.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

The feature behavior can be controlled by various

parameters.

# 6 Performance of Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

The impact of the feature can be observed using PM

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

The DuRrpShareUpdate PM event is introduced to monitor the information about the

resource share updates. The Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning feature

deprecates this PM event and replaces it with the DuPerCellpartitionResourceRep PM

event.

The following PM events can be used to observe throughput changes of partitions and

throughputs:

- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr10
- DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRep
- DuPerUeTrafficRep
- DuPerCellpartitionResourceRep
- DuPerCellResourceRep

For more information on the events associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

# 7 Activate Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012729 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012729 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
