| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4032                                                     |
| Node Type              | Baseband                                                         |
| Access Type            | NR                                                               |
| Licensing              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature introduces the option to configure the priority of SRBs for different UE

groups. By configuring priority for selected UE groups, higher accessibility can be

provided.

The feature supports Low-Band and Mid-Band.

The feature provides the following

benefits:

- Improved accessibility for prioritized connection requests for chosen groups of UEs based on UE grouping
- Improved the success rate of DRB setup for UE groups with higher configured SRB priority during high load scenarios

Additional Information

For more information and related topics, see the UE Grouping Framework feature.

# 2 Dependencies of Adaptive SRB Priority

The feature can be configured

with

the UE Grouping Framework and

has

dependencies to bearer control and radio access features.

SRB priority                                     can be assigned based on the UE group selection criteria. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

SRB prioritization cannot be assigned after the RRC RRCSetupRequest

message in MSG3.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Adaptive SRB Priority

The feature allows the configuration of SRB priority.

The feature introduces the SrbPriorityUeCfg.srbPriority  attribute to

configure SRB priority after the Initial Context Setup procedure.

During the Initial Context Setup procedure, the configuration of SRB1 and SRB2 is based

on the priority selected for the UE group the UE belongs to.

# 4 Network Impact of Adaptive SRB Priority

The feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Adaptive SRB Priority

The feature introduces

an

attribute for SRB priority configuration.
