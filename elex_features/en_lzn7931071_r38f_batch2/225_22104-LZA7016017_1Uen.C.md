Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature is only supported in Low-Band configurations.

This feature is not supported in EN-DC-only deployments.

The minimum supported cell bandwidth is 10 MHz.

SSSG switching is only supported on PCells if all SCells are deactivated.

Only one switch DCI is supported for each slot.

The DCI used in SSSG switching can only be scheduled in downlink through using DCI

format 1\_1 on the PDCCH.

Network Requirements

The UE must support the sssg-Switching-1BitInd-r17 capability defined

in 3GPP Release 17 for SSSG switching to be operational.

# 3 Feature Operation of Flexible PDCCH Monitoring

This feature adds support for

SSSG

switching between SSSG0 and SSSG1.

This feature uses SSSG switching between SSSG0 and SSSG1 to improve power saving for UEs

with intermittent data connections. The following SSSGs can be configured in the UE:

| SSSG0   |    | An SSSG configured for dense search space. In SSSG0, PDCCH monitoring                             occasions happen in every slot. When the data volume is high, UEs are                             switched to this SSSG.                      |
|---------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| SSSG1   |    | An SSSG configured for sparse search space. In SSSG1, PDCCH monitoring                             occasions happen in every fourth slot. When the data volume is low, UEs                             are switched to this SSSG to save power. |

Figure 1   DCI-Based BWP Switching

The following attributes are used to define the thresholds and timers used during

SSSG

switching evaluation:

- SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downDlThreshold
- SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downUlThreshold
- SssgSwitchPwrOpt.lowDlActivityTimer
- SssgSwitchPwrOpt.lowUlActivityTimer
- SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold
- SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upUlThreshold

Operation of Switching to SSSG1

The gNodeB initiates the process to switch the UE to SSSG1 if the following

conditions are all met:

- The number of downlink slots needed to transmit all bits in the buffer is equal to or less than the downlink threshold for the time specified by the downlink timer.
- The number of uplink slots needed to transmit all bits in the buffer is equal to or less than the uplink threshold for the time specified by the uplink timer.

When the conditions are met, the gNodeB sends a switch DCI to the UE.

The thresholds for switching to SSSG1 can be configured with the

SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downDlThreshold and

SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downUlThreshold attributes. The values of

these attributes represent the number of downlink and uplink slots multiplied by

100.

Example 1   Slot Representation of Thresholds for Switching to SSSG1

If the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downDlThreshold attribute is set to

100, the switch can be performed if the data in the buffer is

equal to or less than the data that can be transmitted in one downlink slot. If the

attribute is set to 200, the threshold is at two downlink slots,

and so on.

Process of Switching to SSSG0

The gNodeB initiates the process to switch the UE to SSSG0 if any of the following

conditions are met:

- The number of downlink slots needed to transmit all bits in the buffer is greater than the downlink threshold.
- The number of uplink slots needed to transmit all bits in the buffer is greater than the uplink threshold.

When these conditions are met, the gNodeB sends an switch DCI to the UE.

The thresholds for switching to SSSG0 can be configured with the

SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold and

SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upUlThreshold attributes. The value of these

attributes represents the number of downlink and uplink slots times 100.

Figure 2   SSSG Switching Procedure

Example 2   Slot Representation of Thresholds for Switching to

SSSG0

If the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold attribute is

set to 100, the switch can be performed if the data in the buffer is

equal to or less than the data that can be transmitted in one downlink slot. If the

attribute is set to 200, the threshold is at two downlink slots, and so

on.

Suspension of SSSG Switching

If the UE is in poor radio conditions, SSSG switching to SSSG1 is suspended to

prevent frequent DCI-based switch messages and data retransmissions. If switching to

SSSG1 is suspended, UEs that are already in SSSG1 are not switched to SSSG0 unless

the conditions for SSSG switching are met.

The gNodeB detects poor radio conditions based on downlink SINR. The threshold for

poor radio conditions, where switching to SSSG1 is suspended, can be configured with

the NRCellDU.poorRadioQualSssgSwitchThresh attribute. The

threshold for good radio conditions, where the suspension ends and switching to

SSSG1 can be performed again, can be configured with the

NRCellDU.qualHystSssgSwitch attribute.

Figure 3   Threshold for Poor and Good Radio Conditions

## 3.1 SSSG Configuration

Two SSSGs must be configured for the UE to support SSSG switching,.

If the feature is activated and the UE supports SSSG switching, SSSG0 is initially used

during the following RRC procedures:

- Attach
- Handover
- Re-establishment
- Resume

If the data volume is low, the gNodeB can switch the UE to SSSG1 to save power.

## 3.2 Flexible PDCCH Monitoring and NR Reduced Bandwidth Support Feature Coexistence

If the Flexible PDCCH Monitoring feature and the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

feature are used together, SSSG switching can be configured on both F-BWP and

P-BWP.

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature makes it possible to configure the cell with

a F-BWP, and configure a P-BWP for the same cell. The Flexible PDCCH Monitoring feature

uses this configuration for RedCap UEs that only support BWPs that are less

than or equal to 20 MHz.

The following procedure is used to configure UEs for F-BWP and P-BWP SSSG switching:

1. The UE uses the initial BWP configured in the System Information Block.
2. The gNodeB configures the P-BWP at RRC setup.
3. The gNodeB checks the UE capabilities.
4. The following options are possible: If the UE supports a bandwidth that is equal to the carrier bandwidth, the gNodeB configures the F-BWP for the UE. Otherwise, the UE stays configured for the P-BWP.
5. If the UE supports SSSG switching, two SSSGs are configured for P-BWP or F-BWP depending on which BWP is configured in the UE. SSSG switching is used to change between SSSG0 and SSSG1 in P-BWP or F-BWP. Note: SSSGs are configured on the cell level. The SSSGs used in P-BWP and the SSSGs used in F-BWP use the same configuration.

For more information, see the following documentation:

- Flexible PDCCH Monitoring
- NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

# 4 Network Impact of Flexible PDCCH Monitoring

This feature can improve UE power saving.

Capacity and Performance

The switch DCI has a higher scheduling priority than DRB transmissions to minimize

the negative impact on performance. This might decrease cell throughput at high

load.

Interfaces

This feature introduces the following IEs:

- The searchSpaceSwitchDelay-r17 IE specifies a minimum delay before an SSSG switch can take place. This delay is measured in symbols.
- The searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17 IE contains a list of search space group IDs associated with the search space.

Other Network Elements

This feature can improve UE power saving depending on the amount of time the UE

spends in sparse SSSG.

# 5 Parameters for Flexible PDCCH Monitoring

This feature introduces attributes

that

can be used to configure SSSG

switching.

# 6 Performance of Flexible PDCCH Monitoring

The benefits of this feature can be observed through

the

introduced PM counters.

Key Performance Indicators

The number of slots available for scheduling is lower in SSSG1 than in SSSG0 because

of the configuration of sparse search space. Therefore, the amount of data in the

buffer can accumulate in SSSG1 until the next available slot. This might increase

the cell throughput, which can be observed through the following

KPIs:

- Normalized Average UL MAC Cell Throughput considering successful PUSCH slot only
- Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput considering traffic

The KPIs only consider scheduled slots for cell throughput calculation.

Other cell throughput KPIs that consider non-scheduled slots for cell throughput

calculation are not affected.

The DL HARQ Success Rate PI can decrease if no PDSCH transmission is performed with a

switch DCI which contains fake PDSCH resource allocation. When the UE receives a

switch DCI with fake PDSCH resource allocation, a NACK is sent as HARQ feedback on

the PUCCH. The extent of this impact depends on the regularity of DCI-based SSSG

switches. The regularity is decided by different factors, which include the

following:

- The traffic patterns
- The radio condition of active UEs in the cell
- The Configured DCI-based SSSG switching thresholds

The DL HARQ DTX Rate Total PI can increase if a UE does not receive the switch DCI.

In this case, the UE might not receive DCI messages sent in PDCCH monitoring

occasions that are configured differently for SSSG0 and SSSG1. The missed DCI

messages are counted as DTX. The extent of this impact depends on the number of

missed DCI messages and the number of non-received DCI for switching to SSSG0.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Flexible PDCCH Monitoring

## 9.1 SSSG Switching with Carrier Aggregation

SSSG switching limitations must be considered when configuring

SSSG

switching with carrier aggregation.

When configuring SSSG switching with carrier aggregation, the following limitations must

be considered:

- SSSG switching to SSSG1 is not supported when an SCell is activated.
- SCell activation is not supported when the UE is in SSSG1.
- The SCell activation threshold must be higher than the threshold for switching to SSSG0 for both downlink and uplink. The SCell activation threshold can be configured with the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactDataThres attribute for downlink and the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThresh attribute for uplink. The SSSG switching threshold can be configured with the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold attribute for downlink and the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upUlThreshold attribute for uplink.Note: The units of the threshold values are different. All of the following values correspond to one slot: A value of 100 for the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold and the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upUlThreshold attributes A value of 10 for the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactDataThres and the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThresh attributes
- The SCell deactivation threshold must be higher than the threshold for switching to SSSG1 for both downlink and uplink. The SCell deactivation threshold for downlink can be determined by subtracting the value of the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactDataThresHyst attribute from the value of the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactDataThres attribute. The SCell deactivation threshold for uplink can be determined by subtracting the value of the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThreshHyst attribute from the value of the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThresh attribute. The SSSG switching threshold can be configured with the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downDlThreshold attribute for downlink and the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downUlThreshold attribute for uplink.Note: The units of the threshold values is different. All of the following values correspond to 0.1 slot: A value of 10 for the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downDlThreshold and the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downUlThreshold attributes A value of 1 for the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactDataThres and the CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThresh attributes

## 9.2 SSSG Switching with Time-Critical Services

SSSG switching is recommended to be suspended on UE group level when time-critical

services are used.

Data for time-critical services can be scheduled both on SSSG0 and SSSG1. However, an

extra scheduling delay can occur for UEs in SSSG1 because the number of slots available

for scheduling is lower in SSSG1 than in SSSG0. Therefore, it is not recommended to use

SSSG switching in delay-sensitive cases, such as time-critical services to minimize

negative performance impacts,

## 9.3 SSSG Switching with VoNR

If SSSG switching is used with VoNR, the feature configuration can be adjusted to

prevent the impact on performance.

Data for VoNR can be scheduled on both SSSG0 and SSSG1.

Too many VoNR UEs in SSSG1 can degrade capacity and performance. The impact can be

prevented by defining the maximum number of UEs that are allowed in SSSG1 through the

NRCellDU.maxNoOfUeInSparseSssg attribute.

UEs

that stay in SSSG1 in poor radio conditions can have a negative

impact on performance. As VoNR has a unique traffic pattern, SSSG switching to SSSG0

might not be triggered in time. This can be prevented with the following options:

- Using a different SSSG switching configuration for VoNR with the UE Grouping Framework feature.
- Setting the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold and the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upUlThreshold attributes to lower values when configuring SSSG switching with VoNR compared to SSSG switching without VoNR.

Figure 4   Recommended Configuration for SSSG Switching with VoNR

## 9.4 Avoidance of Unnecessary SSSG Switches

Thresholds can be configured and adjusted to decrease the number of unnecessary SSSG

switches.

To avoid unnecessary SSSG switching, the thresholds for switching to SSSG0 is recommended

to be set to a value that is at least five times higher than the value of the

corresponding thresholds for SSSG1.

In most cases, the arrival time between data bursts is expected to be shorter than 200 ms

for

high

data rate services. Therefore, it is recommended to set the

SssgSwitchPwrOpt.lowDlActivityTimer and the

SssgSwitchPwrOpt.lowUlActivityTimer

attributes to a value of at least 200.

If too many SSSG switches are observed, it is recommended to adjust the difference

between the values of the SSSG switching threshold attributes and the value of the

low-activity timer attributes in the following ways:

- Increasing the difference between the values of the thresholds for switching to SSSG0 and the values of the thresholds for switching to SSSG1.
- Increasing the values of the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.lowDlActivityTimer and the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.lowUlActivityTimer attributes.

Example 3   Recommended Difference Between SSSG Switching Thresholds

If the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.downDlThreshold attribute is set to

10, the SssgSwitchPwrOpt.upDlThreshold

attribute is recommended to be set to at least 50.
