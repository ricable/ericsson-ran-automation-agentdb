# 1 NR Downlink Data and Handover in the Same TTI Overview

The feature allows the transmission of downlink data when handover is

triggered.

Summary

The feature introduces the option to transmit the already queued downlink data during

handover. The downlink data is transmitted in the same TTI (Transmission Time

Interval) as the RRC RRCReconfiguration message with the handover

command in one DRB. The feature is recommended for low-traffic services, for example

voice calls.

The feature supports UE group configuration.

The feature shortens the gaps in data transmission during handover procedures.

Hardware

The feature is not supported on

RAN

Compute group 5e and 6.

Limitations

The feature is only supported on

RLC

(Radio Link Control) UM DRBs.

The feature is not supported in NR-DC and EN-DC.

The feature is not supported in High-Band deployments.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Downlink Data and Handover in the Same TTI

The feature shortens the gaps in downlink data transmission during

handover.

The feature allows the transmission of the queued downlink data in the same

TTI

(Transmission Time Interval) as the

RRC

RRCReconfiguration message with handover command.

The feature can be configured for each DRB without any 5QI value restriction by setting

the DrbDataUeCfg.drbDlDataDuringHoEnabled attribute to

true. Downlink data transmission is only applied to one DRB.

The data packets sent with the handover message are sent to the target gNodeB as

well.

If there is no downlink data to send, only the

RRC

RRCReconfiguration message with handover command is

sent.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Downlink Data and Handover in the Same TTI

The feature has an impact on handover success rate.

Capacity and Performance

Handover success rate might degrade because of the

increased

data volume scheduled for transmission. This impact can increase in poor coverage.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Downlink Data and Handover in the Same TTI

The feature introduces attributes to control downlink data transmission in the same

TTI as the

handover

command.
