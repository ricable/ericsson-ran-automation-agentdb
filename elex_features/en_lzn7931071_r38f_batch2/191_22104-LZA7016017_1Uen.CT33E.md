| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature supports the following uplink carrier aggregation configurations:

- A Low-Band and a Mid-Band uplink component carrier
- Two inter-band Low-Band uplink component carriers

To aggregate two inter-band Low-Band uplink component carriers on separate nodes, the

license key must be installed on both nodes.

The feature provides the following configuration options on the UE

group level:

- Enabling or disabling uplink carrier aggregation
- Setting the maximum number of uplink component carriers
- Controlling which frequencies are allowed to be SCell frequencies

This improves service performance and helps to fulfill regulatory

requirements.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improved uplink peak throughput
- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum
- Expected increase in cell utilization

The feature supports NR standalone deployment except for NR-DC deployment.

Hardware

The feature is not supported on AIR 3284.

Limitations

- The feature supports NR standalone deployment except for NR-DC deployment.
- EN-DC deployment is not supported, but the feature is supported in EN-DC and NR SA dual-mode cells, for example a cell with the NRCellDU.secondaryCellOnly attribute set to true can be configured as an SCell for uplink carrier aggregation.
- The feature requires the SCell to be configured for both uplink and downlink. All the limitations for downlink-only SCell apply to SCells configured for uplink carrier aggregation.
- The feature does not support the following uplink carrier aggregation configurations: Two intra-band uplink Low-Band component carriers Two Mid-Band component carriers Two Low-Band ESS component carriers with non-colocated antennas
- For the maximum RTT delay supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners in uplink, see E5 Link RTT Requirements for Carrier Aggregation in Advanced RAN Coordination.

Network Requirements

For the aggregation of two uplink component carriers with inter-gNodeB-DUs, IDLe or

TN port connectivity is required as uplink carrier aggregation between gNodeB-DUs

only works when E5 links are set up.

UEs need multiple timing advance groups capability for selected band combinations if

the PCell and the SCell belong to different timing advance groups. For more

information about the number of timing advance groups supported by UEs, see

3GPP TS 38.306; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Access Capabilities.

The PCell and the SCell can belong to different timing advance groups when the PCell

and the SCell have different N\_TA offset

values

or when the PCell and the SCell antennas are non-colocated.

UEs need to have 3 Tx capability in selected band combinations for simultaneous

uplink carrier aggregation and uplink SU-MIMO configurations in a device.

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature enables higher uplink throughput by aggregating a Low-Band and a Mid-Band

component carrier or two Low-Band component

carriers.

Supported Capacity Module Deployments

The feature supports different capacity module deployments.

Carriers

SCell Selection

The gNodeB runs the SCell selection algorithm and checks the following

information:

- The SCell candidate configurations
- The carrier aggregation configuration
- The UE capabilities
- The lists of allowed band combinations

The serving cell selection can be configured through the

CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute. The selected value attempts

to prioritize maximized peak downlink or uplink throughput, depending on the

selection.

If downlink throughput is prioritized, a cell set is selected to maximize downlink

throughput, and if possible, downlink MIMO layers are added. Then, on the selected

cell set, the SCell that provides the best uplink throughput is selected for

uplink.

If uplink throughput is prioritized, a cell set is selected to maximize uplink

throughput. Then, downlink SCells that provide the best downlink throughput are

added to the selected cell set. After this, additional downlink and uplink MIMO

layers are added.

During SCell selection, the feature checks the number of allowed component carriers

and their frequencies.

The following criteria are checked when the SCell selection procedure starts:

- If uplink carrier aggregation is not allowed for the UE group containing the UE, that is, if the value of the CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed attribute is set to 1.
- If a cell serves on a frequency that is blocked, that cell is not allowed to be an SCell candidate for the UE. The blocked frequencies are listed in the CaCellProfileUeCfg.blockedSCellFreqList attribute.

Figure 3   SCell Selection Action Flow

The maximum number of component carriers that the carrier aggregation configuration

can contain in the allowed frequencies is configured by the

CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed attribute. The number of component carriers is

limited by other factors, for example by UE capability.

Initial SCell Configuration

The maximum power for uplink transmission on the PCell can be reduced when an uplink

SCell is configured.

When uplink carrier aggregation is selected for configuration on the UE, the

UE-configured maximum transmission power is calculated for the selected band

combination. This occurs before RRC Reconfiguration is sent to the UE.

The CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute controls

the configuration mode for the uplink aspect of the SCell and the configuration of

the PCell coverage power reduction measurement. The

CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute can be

configured with one of the following values:

- IMMEDIATE
- DELAYED\_ALWAYS
- DELAYED\_CONDITIONAL

The PCell uplink coverage A1 and A2 power reduction measurement report configurations

use the parameters from the following attributes:

- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidate
- TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateOffset
- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidatePcOffset Note: This attribute is indexed by the UE power class measurements for the uplink band combination.
- CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode Note: The value of the CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute only applies to uplink SCell configuration outside of the Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR Traffic Steering feature. With the Multi-Layer Coordination evaluations, coverage is always confirmed and the power reduction handling is used regardless of the configuration of the CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute.

If the UE is configured with the A1 measurement measuring good PCell coverage, then

when the UE sends the A1 measurement report, the gNodeB reconfigures the UE. The UE

is reconfigured with the following measurement configurations:

- The A1 measurement is deconfigured.
- The A2 measurement is configured.

If the Multi-Layer Coordination or the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility

function is enabled, A1 and A2 measurements are configured in the UE on the downlink

signal to estimate good uplink SCell coverage. The following measurements are

initiated on all uplink-capable SCells in the serving cell set:

- A1 measurement on the downlink signal to estimate good uplink SCell coverage
- A2 measurement on the downlink signal to estimate poor uplink SCell coverage

The Multi-Layer Coordination function uses the coverage information to select a

better uplink SCell than the initially selected one. If the Multi-Layer Coordination

function is disabled because of UE group change, the A1 and A2 measurements on the

downlink signal for estimations of good uplink SCell coverage are removed.

Initial SCell configuration is performed during the following procedures:

- Initial Context Setup when it includes the setup of the first PDU Session Resource Setup.
- PDU Session Resource Setup
- Incoming Intra-gNodeB or Inter-gNodeB handover
- RRC Re-establishment and RRC Resume
- UE capability refresh, that is when the gNodeB compares UE capability information received from source gNodeB during handover, RRC Resume or RRC Re-establishment. The gNodeB decides if this information is sufficient or if reinquiry is required.

The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is used to configure the UE with an uplink

SCell.

The Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Degraded alarm is raised when there is an

uplink carrier aggregation capability mismatch between partner nodes. To learn more

about the alarm, see Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Degraded.

Multi-Layer Coordination and Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility

Functions

After the initial SCell selection, if the Multi-Layer Coordination or the Dynamic

Cell Set Change during Mobility function is enabled, the coverage of uplink-capable

SCells is tracked. When the Multi-Layer Coordination or the Dynamic Cell Set Change

during Mobility function is triggered, the coverage information for the SCell

measurements configured at initial SCell configuration is taken into account when

finding a better candidate cell set.

The Multi-Layer Coordination function attempts to find a better cell set than the

configured cell set by comparing the uplink and downlink cell set weights. Uplink is

prioritized over downlink when the

CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute is

set to PRIORITIZE\_UL\_THP. For more information on the algorithm

used to find a better cell set when uplink throughput is prioritized, see NR Traffic Steering.

When a better candidate cell set is found, it can be a candidate for PCell handover

or SCell reselection. If all configured measurements in the Multi-Layer Coordination

or the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function report good coverage, a

handover or an SCell reselection is triggered. The new cell set is configured in the

UE with the A1 or A2 measurements for uplink and downlink on the new SCells.

If there is a best cell set candidate with a new PCell, the following measurements

are configured:

- A5 measurement is configured to measure on the candidate PCell frequency. The RSRP threshold is set considering the potential power reduction in the target cell set.
- A5 measurement is configured to measure downlink coverage on the candidate downlink SCell frequency, if the SCell is not already known to be in downlink coverage.
- A5 measurement is configured to measure uplink coverage on the candidate uplink SCell frequency, if the SCell is not already known to be in uplink coverage.

If there is a best cell set candidate with the same PCell as the current PCell, the

following measurements are configured:

- When a candidate configuration is evaluated for uplink carrier aggregation, the MLC Current PCell Coverage A1 measurement is configured only when power reduction is indicated. This happens regardless of the value of the CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute.
- A5 measurement is configured to measure downlink coverage on the candidate downlink SCell frequency, if the SCell is not already known to be in downlink coverage.
- A5 measurement is configured to measure uplink coverage on the candidate uplink SCell frequency, if the SCell is not already known to be in uplink coverage.

## 3.1 SCell Configuration and Deconfiguration

The feature enables the configuration of serving cell selection to prioritize uplink

or downlink throughput.

The uplink SCell is configured based on UE capability and the availability of SCell

candidates with different subcarrier spacing than the PCell. UEs need multiple timing

advance groups capability for selected band combinations if the PCell and the SCell

belong to different timing advance groups. For more information about the number of

timing advance groups supported by UEs, see 3GPP TS 38.306; NR; User Equipment

(UE) Radio Access Capabilities. The PCell and SCell can belong to different

timing advance groups when the PCell and the SCell have different N\_TA offset

values.

The serving cell selection can be configured with the

CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute. The

selected value attempts to prioritize maximized peak downlink or uplink throughput,

depending on the selection.

If downlink throughput is prioritized, a cell set is selected to maximize downlink

throughput first, along with adding downlink MIMO layers, if possible. Then, on the

selected cell set, the SCell that provides the best uplink throughput is selected for

uplink.

If uplink throughput is prioritized, a cell set is selected to maximize uplink throughput

first. Then, downlink SCells that provide the best downlink throughput are added to the

selected cell set, before additional downlink and uplink MIMO layers are added.

The estimated throughput depends primarily on the following characteristics:

- Effective carrier bandwidth
- Maximum number of MIMO layers
- Maximum modulation scheme

To maximize uplink throughput, both the uplink component carriers and the uplink SU-MIMO

layers are considered. The network selects carrier aggregation or uplink SU-MIMO for

2TX-capable UEs according to the respective estimated throughput.

SCells are initially selected from configured SCell candidates. The SCell candidates can

be configured to allow only downlink carrier aggregation or uplink and downlink carrier

aggregation through the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute.

## 3.2 SCell Activation and Deactivation

The SCell activation and deactivation applies simultaneously to downlink and uplink for

an SCell that has uplink enabled.

If the Data-Aware Carrier Management feature is enabled, the

CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThresh and

CaSCellHandlingUeCfg.sCellActDeactUlDataThreshHyst attributes

control the activation and deactivation thresholds in the following way:

- For SCell activation, the uplink or downlink buffer conditions need to be fulfilled.
- For SCell deactivation, the uplink and the downlink buffer conditions need to be fulfilled.

For more information on the SCell activation and deactivation conditions if the

Data-Aware Carrier Management feature is enabled, see Data-Aware Carrier Management.

All active SCells are deactivated if the UE reports UAI overheating. SCell reactivation

is not allowed until the overheating condition is mitigated. If the UAI overheating is

mitigated, SCells can be reactivated if the PCell capacity is not sufficient to serve

the needed downlink or uplink data. For more information on UAI overheating mitigation,

see NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation.

## 3.3 Link Scheduling

Multi-carrier transmission in uplink occurs when uplink component carriers have

overlapping uplink slots. Between two Low-Band component carriers, all uplink slots

overlap. Between a Low-Band and Mid-Band component carrier, whether uplink slots overlap

depends on the TDD pattern of the Mid-Band component carrier. The UE can use its full UE

transmission power for data transmission for non-overlapping slots in Low-Band.

If PCell and SCell uplink slots overlap in time, the UE transmission power must be split

between the uplink component carriers in use. Multi-carrier transmission is used only if

the transmission power is sufficient.

If the uplink slot on a Low-Band SCell overlaps with two consecutive Mid-Band PCell

uplink slots, the SCell uplink slot is used for short PUSCH transmission. A PUSCH

transmission is short if the number of symbols is less than 14.

If single carrier transmission is used, the following cases are possible:

- The PCell sends a small amount of data.
- The SCell sends consecutive retransmissions.
- Not enough power for multi-carrier transmissions and the carrier with the best predicted throughput is prioritized.

The feature limits PUCCH and CSI reporting on PUSCH to the PCell. The downlink ACK or

NACK feedback is sent by UEs through the following channels:

- PUCCH on PCell, if there is no PUSCH allocation on PCell or SCell.
- PUSCH on PCell, if PCell PUSCH is allocated.
- PUSCH on SCell, if SCell PUSCH is allocated and there is no overlapping PUSCH allocation on the PCell.

## 3.4 CQI-Based UE Overheating Detection

UE overheating detection is based on link adaptation data received in the CSI report for

the SCells from the UE. The UE is in normal or overheated state depending on the

reported CQI and RI values. If the UE is in overheated state, the uplink and downlink

scheduling are both restricted to the PCell only. This allows the UE to cool down and

recover from overheating.

In the overheated state, the SCells are not used, but they are kept activated. This is

required to receive the updated SCell CQI values needed to leave the overheated

state.

The UE overheating detection in the gNodeB works in the following way:

- When the UE reports CQI=0 and RI=1 for any SCell, indicating two layers, the UE is considered overheated. Scheduling is stopped on all SCells.
- When the UE in overheated state sends two consecutive CSI reports with CQI&gt;0 for an SCell, the gNodeB resumes scheduling on the specified SCell.

Example 1   UE Recovered from Overheating

1. The UE reports CQI=0 and RI=1 for SCell1. Scheduling stops both in SCell1 and SCell2.
2. The UE reports CQI&gt;0 for SCell2 in two consecutive CSI reports. Scheduling resumes for SCell2, but remains stopped in SCell1.
3. The UE reports CQI&gt;0 for SCell1 in two consecutive CSI reports. Scheduling resumes for SCell1. Both SCells are now in normal condition.

Example 2   UE Remains Overheated

1. The UE reports CQI=0 and RI=1 for SCell1. Scheduling stops both in SCell1 and SCell2.
2. The UE reports CQI&gt;0 for SCell2 in two consecutive CSI reports. Scheduling resumes for SCell2, but remains stopped in SCell1.
3. The UE reports CQI=0 and RI=1 for SCell2. Scheduling stops in SCell2 again.

## 3.5 Colocated and Non-Colocated Antennas

Uplink carrier aggregation is supported for deployments where the PCell and the SCell

antennas can be colocated or non-colocated.

For colocated antennas, the maximum supported distance between the antennas is around 78

meters.

For non-colocated antennas, the maximum supported distance between the antennas depends

on the following factors:

- Maximum uplink transmission timing difference at UE side
- Maximum receive timing difference at UE side
- Time alignment error
- N\_TA offset values for the PCell and the SCell

## 3.6 UE Group Support for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature is adapted to the UE Grouping Framework.

The feature is configured through the following attributes, which belong to the

CaCellProfileUeCfg MO class that is adapted to the UE Grouping

Framework:

- CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxDlCcAllowed
- CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed
- CaCellProfileUeCfg.blockedSCellFreqList
- CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy
- CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulTxSwitchingAllowed

The attributes are read from the MO class instance that is selected based on the UE

groups that the UE belongs to.

When the UE groups that the UE belongs to change, the change can result in the selection

of a new instance of the CaCellProfileUeCfg MO class, which contains

the configuration attributes. If the value of any configuration attribute changes

because of the selection of a new MO class instance, all SCells are reselected. Then, UE

measurements are reconfigured based on this new selection.

Figure 4 shows an example of different

configurations for carrier aggregation for three different groups of UEs. The cell

profile settings can be different depending on which SpCell the UE belongs to.

Table 2   Example Cell Profile Settings for TDD SpCell

| Attribute                               | Base Group   | UE Group 1   | UE Group 2     |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed       | 32           | 1            | 2              |

Figure 4   Carrier Aggregation Configuration Example

The UE group support for this function is controlled by the User- and Service-Specific

Carrier Aggregation feature. If the license of the feature is not activated,

configuration data is always taken from the Base instances of the

CACellProfileUeCfg MO class.

## 3.7 UE Group Support for Uplink Carrier Aggregation Power Reduction

The Uplink Carrier Aggregation Power Reduction Measurements function is adapted to

the UE Grouping Framework.

The Uplink Carrier Aggregation Power Reduction Measurements function can be configured

with the following attributes, which belong to MO classes that are adapted to the UE

Grouping Framework:

- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidate
- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidatePcOffset
- TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateOffset

The attributes are read from the MO class instance that is selected based on the UE

groups that the UE belongs to.

When the UE groups that the UE belongs to change, the change can result in the selection

of a new instance of the MO class to which the listed attributes belong. If ongoing

Uplink Carrier Aggregation Power Reduction measurements exist in the UE and the value of

any of the listed attributes changes because of the selection of a new MO instance, the

Uplink Carrier Aggregation Power Reduction measurements are reconfigured in the UE with

the new values. If uplink carrier aggregation power reduction is required after a UE

group change, but no Uplink Carrier Aggregation Power Reduction measurements exist in

the UE, then these measurements are configured.

The UE group support for this function is controlled by the User- and Service-Specific

Mobility feature. If the license of this feature is not activated, configuration data is

always taken from the Base instances of the following MO classes:

- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg
- TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg

For more information on the feature license activation, see User- and Service-Specific Mobility.

## 3.8 Interaction with Other Features

At NR-DC setup, the existing uplink carrier aggregation configuration is removed.

Measurements related to uplink carrier aggregation are also removed.

At NR-DC release, the uplink carrier aggregation configuration is evaluated to determine

the possible configurations for the UE.

Intra-frequency SCell changes, which are triggered by A6 measurement reports on SCell

frequencies, trigger the selection of a new serving cell set. The uplink carrier

aggregation configuration is evaluated to determine the possible configurations for the

UE for the new serving cell set.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves uplink peak rates and cell utilization.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves cell utilization by distributing uplink data transmission across

two component carriers. The improved uplink peak rates provide better application

coverage for uplink-demanding services.

Depending on the Baseband unit and the Mixed Mode configuration, the carrier

aggregation single UE peak rate might be limited by the Baseband throughput

capacity. For peak throughput and capacity values, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.

Aggregating a Low-Band and a Mid-Band carrier or two Low-Band component carriers

increases UE uplink throughput. For the aggregation of a Low-Band and a Mid-Band

carrier, the Low-Band carrier provides additional uplink throughput during the

non-uplink slots of the Mid-Band carrier. During overlapping uplink slots of the two

carriers, the SCell can provide additional throughput when the UE has enough

transmission power to transmit on both carriers.

When two Timing Advance (TA) groups are used, a small throughput degradation is

expected for uplink carrier aggregation during the CFRA attempts on the SCell that

occur upon initial SCell synchronization and if the SCell loses synchronization

because of a traffic event or mobility.

When two TA groups are used with colocated antennas, the number of the CFRA attempts

on the SCell can be reduced because the timing advance can be tracked based on PCell

measurements.

If the NRCellDU.puschModeOnFddSCell attribute is set to a value

other than LONG, UE uplink throughput increases as more slots are

available on the Low-Band SCell for PUSCH data scheduling.

UE uplink throughput can be further increased if the Uplink Single-User MIMO and the NR Uplink

Carrier Aggregation features are both configured. This enables two-layer uplink

transmission in the Mid-Band PCell. The simultaneous use of the two features is only

possible with three Tx-capable devices.

The feature can be deconfigured during VoNR calls for improved VoNR retainability. It

is recommended to deconfigure NR uplink carrier aggregation during VoNR calls.

It is not recommended to configure NR uplink carrier aggregation with the Uplink

Configured Grant for URLLC Public RAN feature and the Uplink Configured Grant for

URLLC Dedicated RAN feature. For more information on how to deconfigure NR uplink

carrier aggregation for VoNR calls, see Engineering Guidelines for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation.

Interfaces

The feature configures the following measurements on the UE

over

the Uu interface through RRCReconfiguration

messages to support coverage evaluation for uplink carrier aggregation:

- A1 measurement on the downlink signal to estimate good uplink SCell coverage
- A2 measurement on the downlink signal to estimate poor uplink SCell coverage
- A5 measurement on the downlink signal to estimate uplink candidate SCell coverage
- A1 measurement on the downlink signal on the PCell to evaluate the current PCell as a PCell candidate with power reduction

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| Percentage Unrestricted Volume UL             | The KPI might be higher because the uplink carrier aggregation                                     provides a larger pipe. As a result, more transmissions end up                                     as unrestricted volume in the last slot or in a single slot                                     volume.

The KPI might be higher depending on the calculation                                     method of the KPI, as the ratio of user sessions with higher                                     throughput is expected to increase because of the increased                                     uplink data transmission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Random Access Success Rate Captured in gNodeB | The KPI might improve because of the reduced number of random                                     access attempts. Random access attempts are reduced because of                                     the extended random access response window and the extended                                     coverage with aggregated uplink component carriers.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The configuration of the feature is UE group-adapted by using the attributes in the

CaCellProfile and the TrStSaCellProfile MO

instances.

The feature requires manual configuration.

When the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature is activated, it is recommended to set the

NRCellDU.caPerCcFairnessWeightUlEnabled attribute to

true.

It is recommended to enable the NR Traffic Steering feature for uplink carrier

aggregation as the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature operates with limited

functionality without the NR Traffic Steering feature.

It is recommended to configure multiple CFRA preambles in high uplink traffic load with

dual timing alignment group deployments to enable the timing alignment and parallel

scheduling of more UEs in the uplink. CFRA preambles are configured with the

NRCellDU.totalNoOfRaPreambles and the

NRCellDU.noOfCbraPreambles attributes. The value of CFRA

preambles is determined by the subtraction of the selected value of the

NRCellDU.noOfCbraPreambles

attribute from the selected value of the

NRCellDU.totalNoOfRaPreambles attribute.

## 9.1 Configure NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation for All UE Connections

The feature requires the NRCellCU.caCellProfileRef attribute to

reference a CaCellProfile MO instance.

The configuration below enables all connected UEs to be handled in the same

manner.

Prerequisites

- The GNBCUCPFunction.carrierAggregation MO instance is created.
- The CarrierAggregation.CaCellProfile MO instance is created.
- The CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute must be set to PRIORITIZE\_DL\_THP in all CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instances under the default CaCellProfile MO instance.
- The E5 connectivity is established between partner gNodeBs.
- The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED to define an inter-frequency neighbor cell to be referenced as an SCell. This configuration allows the neighbor cells to be uplink and downlink SCell candidates.
- The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to a value other than NONE to define cell relations in a given coverage area.

Steps

1. Create a CaCellProfile MO instance.
2. Set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute under the base CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instance that is in the CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 1 to PRIORITIZE\_UL\_THP. Selecting PRIORITIZE\_UL\_THP means that the serving cell selection function first chooses an SCell that is capable of uplink and downlink and then attempts to add more downlink SCells. The CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute with the PRIORITIZE\_UL\_THP value cannot reference the CaCellProfile MO instance in High-Band cells.
3. Set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed attribute under the base CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instance that is in the CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 1 to 2.
4. Configure the NRCellCU.caCellProfileRef attribute to refer to the CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 1 and the CarrierAggregation MO instance created by default.

Results

The NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature configures two component carriers in uplink

for every capable UE connected to the NRCellCU MO.

## 9.2 Configure NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation for Different UE Groups

The feature requires the configuration of the

NRCellCU.caCellProfileRef attribute to reference the

CaCellProfile MO instances.

With the configuration below, connected UEs under different UE groups are treated

differently based on the assigned configuration.

Prerequisites

- The User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation feature is activated.
- The GNBCUCPFunction.carrierAggregation MO instance is created.
- The CarrierAggregation.CaCellProfile MO instance is created.
- The CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute must be set to PRIORITIZE\_DL\_THP in all CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instances under the default CaCellProfile MO instance.
- The E5 connectivity is established between partner gNodeBs.
- The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED to define an inter-frequency neighbor cell to be referenced as an SCell. This configuration allows the neighbor cells to be uplink and downlink SCell candidates.
- The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to a value other than NONE to define cell relations in a given coverage area.

Steps

1. Create different UE group selection profiles under the UeGroupSelection MO. Example One UE group for VoNR can be created using "5qi == 1" as the value for the UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria attribute and one UE group for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) can be created using "5qi &gt;=6" as the value for the UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria attribute. For more information on creating UE group selection profiles, see UE Grouping Framework.
2. Create a CaCellProfile MO instance.
3. Create two new instances of the CaCellProfileUeCfg MO under the CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 2.
4. Set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute to PRIORITIZE\_DL\_THP under the base CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instance that is in the CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 2.

Under the VoNR CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instance in the

CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 2:

5. Set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute to PRIORITIZE\_DL\_THP, set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed attribute to 1, and set the value of the CaCellProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList, CaCellProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList, or the CaCellProfileUeCfg.ueConfGroupList attribute to the ID of the UE group selection profile created in Step 1.

Under the eMBB CaCellProfileUeCfg MO instance in the

CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 2:

6. Set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute to PRIORITIZE\_UL\_THP, set the CaCellProfileUeCfg.maxUlCcAllowed attribute to 2, and set the value of the CaCellProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList, CaCellProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList, or the CaCellProfileUeCfg.ueConfGroupList attribute to the ID of the UE group selection profile created in Step 1. The CaCellProfileUeCfg.servingCellSelectionPolicy attribute with the PRIORITIZE\_UL\_THP value cannot reference the CaCellProfile MO instance in High-Band cells.
7. Configure the NRCellCU.caCellProfileRef attribute to refer to the CaCellProfile MO instance created in Step 2 and the CarrierAggregation MO instance created by default.

Results

By using the framework of the User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation feature,

the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature is configured for use with UE group 5QI

differentiation. VoNR sessions are not allowed to be configured, but eMBB sessions

are allowed to be configured with the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature.

## 9.3 Recommended Configurations for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation UE Measurements

Table 8 describes the UE measurements in the

PCell introduced by the feature. The measurements use

TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidate attribute values.

The measurements in Table 8 need to be

manually configured in the PCell. The following MO references are required for manual

configuration:

- The NRCellCU.nRFrequencyRef MO on the PCell has a valid reference to an instance of the NRFrequency MO.
- The NRCellCU.trStSaCellProfileRef MO on the PCell has a valid reference to an instance of the TrStSaCellProfile MO.
- The NRCellCU MO on the PCell has an instance of the NRFreqRelation MO for intra-frequency measurements.
- The intra-frequency MO instance of the NRFreqRelation.trStSaNrFreqRelProfileRef MO has a valid reference to an instance of the TrStSaNrFreqRelProfile MO.

It is recommended that the PCell UE power reduction A1 threshold for RSRP is greater than

the A1 threshold for the mobility control at poor coverage function. This configuration

enables UEs to land in the good coverage zone of the mobility control at poor coverage

function.

It is recommended that the A1 threshold for good SCell uplink coverage is greater than

the NR carrier aggregation A1 threshold to avoid SCell deactivation.

## 9.4 UE Transmit Timing and Timing Advance Groups

For a UE in RRC connected mode, the gNodeB is responsible for maintaining the Timing

Advance (TA) to keep the physical layer synchronized. Serving cells that have uplink

transmission to which the same TA applies and that use the same timing reference cell

are grouped in a TA group. Each TA group contains at least one serving cell with uplink

configured, and the mapping of each serving cell to a TA group is configured by RRC. TA

updates are signaled by the gNodeB to the UE through MAC CE TA commands for each TA

group. The UE adjusts the timing of its uplink transmission according to the TA commands

received from the gNodeB for the TA group the uplink serving cell belongs to.

3GPP TS38.133 describes the UE transmission timing reference before the

downlink timing of the reference cell with the following equation:

Figure 5 illustrates the timing reference

difference between downlink and uplink.

Figure 5   Uplink-Downlink Timing Relation

The UE calculates the N\_TA value from the TA commands received from the gNodeB. The N\_TA

offset is a serving cell configuration parameter that is provided to the UE by RRC

signaling. The N\_TA offset value depends on the duplex mode of the uplink cell and the

frequency range. The N\_TA offset values defined in NR can be found in Table

7.1.2-2 of 3GPP TS38.133.

According to 3GPP TS38.300, a UE can simultaneously receive or transmit on

one or more component carriers depending on the following capabilities:

- For single timing advance capability, the serving cells are grouped in one TA group.
- For multiple timing advance capability, the serving cells can be grouped in multiple TA groups.

For the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature, if the uplink serving cells have different

N\_TA offset values, they must belong to different TA groups and the UE needs to support

multiple TA groups for the selected band combination that includes uplink serving cells.

The UE expects that the same N\_TA offset value is provided for all the uplink carriers

that have single TA group operation.

In a Mid-Band cell, the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute controls

the N\_TA offset values in the following ways:

- If the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to false, the Mid-Band cell is not deployed in LTE-NR coexistence and is configured with the n25600 N\_TA offset value.
- If the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to true, the Mid-Band cell is deployed in LTE-NR coexistence and is configured with the n39936 N\_TA offset value.

An ESS Low-Band cell is configured with the n0 N\_TA offset value by the system. ESS

configuration in a Low-Band cell depends on the presence of a configured

NRSectorCarrier.essScPairId attribute. If the

NRSectorCarrier.essScPairId attribute is configured, the

NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute cannot be set to

N\_TA\_O\_39936.

In a non-ESS Low-Band cell, the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence and the

NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attributes together control N\_TA

offset values in the following ways:

- If the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to true, the Low-Band cell is deployed in LTE-NR coexistence. The Low-Band cell is configured with the n0 N\_TA offset value by the system. In this case, the NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute cannot be set to N\_TA\_O\_39936.
- If the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to false, the Low-Band cell is not deployed in LTE-NR coexistence and the N\_TA offset values are configured in the following ways: If the NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute is set to N\_TA\_O\_STANDARD, the non-ESS Low-Band cell is configured with the n25600 N\_TA offset value. If the NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute is set to N\_TA\_O\_39936, the non-ESS Low-Band cell is configured with the n39936 N\_TA offset value.

The NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode can be set to

N\_TA\_O\_39936 only in non-ESS Low-Band cells and if the

NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to false.

The NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute is not recommended to be

set to N\_TA\_O\_39936 when the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature is

not activated.

The NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute cannot be set to

N\_TA\_O\_39936 in the following cases:

- In ESS configured cells
- If the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to true
- In Mid-Band and High-Band cells

It is recommended to set the NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode attribute

to N\_TA\_O\_39936 in a Low-Band cell to have single TA group operation if

both of the following conditions are met:

- The cell is configured with uplink carrier aggregation where the cells have different duplex modes. This is the case when the NR cell has the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute set to ALLOWED only towards Mid-Band neighboring NR cells.
- All Mid-Band neighboring NR cells are deployed in LTE-NR coexistence. In this case, the Mid-Band cell is configured with the n39936 N\_TA offset value by the system.

It is not recommended to set the NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode

attribute to N\_TA\_O\_39936 in a Low-Band cell in any of the following

cases:

- The Mid-Band neighboring NR cells are not deployed in LTE-NR co-existence.
- The cell is configured with only Low-Band carrier aggregation. This is the case when the NR cell has the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute set to ALLOWED only towards Low-Band neighboring NR cells.
- The cell is configured with uplink carrier aggregation where the cells have different duplex modes. This is the case when the NR cell has the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute set to ALLOWED towards both Low-Band and Mid-Band neighboring NR cells.

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q2.0: Improved Interaction between Multi-Layer Coordination and NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature enhancement improves the interaction between the NR Uplink Carrier

Aggregation feature and the Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR Traffic Steering

feature by enabling uplink SCell coverage evaluations and better uplink coverage in the cell

set selection.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables uplink SCell evaluations and uplink SCell

reselection. The feature enhancement introduces A1, A2, and A5 measurements on

SCells for uplink coverage, and A1 measurement on the PCell for good uplink

coverage. The A1, A2, and A5 measurement reports for the SCells and the PCell are

sent to the PCell.

The A1 and A2 measurements on SCells are used in uplink carrier aggregation to detect

good or poor uplink coverage on uplink-capable serving cells. The A5 measurement is

used to receive information about the uplink coverage for inter-frequency SCell

candidates. The A1 measurement on the PCell is used to detect good uplink coverage

in the evaluation of an SCell reselection, when power reduction is indicated for the

candidate uplink cell set.

The Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR Traffic Steering feature evaluates

the measurement reports for uplink cell set selection.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits with the support of the

Multi-Layer Coordination function:

- After blind cell set selection, the uplink candidate cell sets can be evaluated to ensure that the selected uplink cell set is possible to configure and is in coverage.
- Uplink SCell reselection can be triggered on the same PCell with a different SCell.
- If power reduction is indicated on the PCell, it is considered in the evaluation of the candidate cell set.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidate attribute is updated

to include the following measurements:

- A1, A2, and A5 measurements are included to measure uplink SCell coverage for uplink SCell coverage evaluations and in the Multi-Layer Coordination function.
- A1 measurement is included for good PCell uplink coverage when power reduction is detected in an SCell reselection scenario.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the Uu interface by updating the

RRCReconfiguration message with the following measurements to

support coverage evaluations for uplink carrier aggregation:

- A1 measurement on an SCell
- A2 measurement on an SCell
- A5 measurement on an uplink SCell candidate
- A1 measurement on the PCell

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

## Appendix A.b: 24.Q2.0: PUSCH Scheduling Enhancement for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature enhancement improves the peak throughput of uplink carrier aggregation by

allowing short PUSCH transmission in the Low-Band SCell in slots that overlap with

consecutive uplink slots in the Mid-Band

PCell.

|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5583                    |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                        |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement improves UCI multiplexing constraints to allow more PUSCH

resources on the Low-Band SCell by using short PUSCH. A PUSCH transmission is short

if the number of symbols is less than 14. The SCell provides additional uplink

throughput as PUSCH transmission is scheduled on the SCell slots that overlap with

the consecutive uplink slots of the Mid-Band PCell. If reciprocity-based beamforming

is enabled on the Mid-Band PCell, the feature enhancement schedules short PUSCH

transmission on the SCell slots that overlap with the PCell SRS transmissions.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The Low-Band SCell provides additional uplink throughput as short PUSCH transmissions can be scheduled on the slots that overlap with consecutive uplink slots in the Mid-Band PCell.
- Short PUSCH transmission is scheduled on the Low-Band SCell slots that overlap with the Mid-Band PCell SRS transmissions if reciprocity-based beamforming is enabled in the Mid-Band PCell. This provides additional uplink throughput in the SCell.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases UE uplink throughput as more slots are available on

the Low-Band carrier for PUSCH data scheduling.

The following KPIs can be used to observe the improved uplink peak throughput:

- Average UL MAC UE Throughput
- Percentage Unrestricted Volume UL

The UL RBSym Utilization Resource Indicator can be used to observe the performance of

the feature enhancement.

The impact on performance can be observed with the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacPdcchBlockingPdschOccasions

- NRCellDU.pmMacThpUlUeMax

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.ulCaTimeAlignmentMode
- NRCellDU.puschModeOnFddSCell

The feature enhancement updates the

NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschTypeB PM counter so it is

supported on Mid-Band and Low-Band. The

pmEbsMacRBSymUsedPuschTypeB EBS counter associated with the

NRCellDU MO is also updated and is supported on Mid-Band and

Low-Band.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                        |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows for the aggregation of two Low-Band uplink component

carriers for inter-band uplink carrier aggregation configuration when the PCell and

SCell are co-located.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Improved uplink peak throughput in Low-Band
- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum
- More flexible NR RAN deployment

Capacity and Performance

Cell utilization is expected to improve because uplink data transmission is

distributed across multiple component carriers. UE uplink throughput is increased by

aggregating two component carriers.

Hardware

The NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature requires at least one NR downlink carrier

aggregation feature to be activated. The hardware requirements of the feature

enhancement are consistent with the hardware requirements of the activated NR

downlink carrier aggregation features.

Other Network Elements

UEs must have the capability to support multiple timing advance groups for the

selected band combinations if the PCell and the SCell belong to different timing

advance groups. For more information about the number of timing advance groups

supported by UEs, see 3GPP TS 38.306.

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

non-colocated.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement increases the maximum supported inter-antenna distance

between the PCell and the SCell for the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature. The

feature enhancement is supported for UEs with the capability to handle two or more

Timing Advance (TA) groups.

The feature enhancement allows the configuration of the cell relation between the

PCell and the SCell to be non-colocated.

The maximum supported inter-antenna distance depends on the following factors:

- The TA offset values used on the PCell and the SCell.
- The maximum receive timing difference, the maximum transmission timing difference, and time alignment error constraints specified in 3GPP TS 38.133 and 3GPP TS 38.104.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases the flexibility of cell deployment.

When two TA groups are used, a small throughput degradation is expected for uplink

carrier aggregation during CFRA attempts on the SCell that occur upon initial SCell

synchronization and when the SCell loses synchronization because of a traffic

scenario or mobility. The throughput can be monitored through the Average UL MAC UE

Throughput KPI.

When two TA groups are used with colocated antennas, the number of CFRA attempts on

the SCell might be reduced as the TA might be tracked based on PCell

measurements.

Configuring cell relations between non-colocated Low-Band carriers might cause the

UEs to be steered to a suboptimal serving cell set. To avoid this, the value of the

NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute can only be set to

ALLOWED if the settings are appropriate for the

TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg MO instances with the following

properties:

- Are referenced by the parent NRCellCU MO
- Can be used by UEs that cannot handle two or more TA groups

These TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg MO instances cannot have both

of the following attribute value settings:

- The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.mlcEnabled attribute set to true
- The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.mlcAllowedCellSetChangeAction attribute set to HANDOVER or HO\_AND\_SCELL\_RESELECTION

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellRelation.colocationIndicator attribute.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement updates the algorithm for the selection of the uplink serving

cell set in Mid-Band and Low-Band to jointly consider cells, bandwidths, MIMO

layers, and uplink 1TX-2TX switching.

The selection algorithm for the serving cell set selects between uplink

MIMO,

uplink carrier

aggregation,

and uplink 1TX-2TX switching based on uplink weights. Uplink

weight depends on uplink layer coverage with the feature enhancement.

The Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR Traffic Steering feature is updated

to ensure that if the UE is in bad coverage where uplink SU-MIMO is not beneficial,

the UE is reconfigured to use uplink carrier aggregation with a Mid-Band and a

Low-Band component carrier. The feature enhancement enables the Multi-Layer

Coordination function to consider uplink layer coverage along with uplink weights

for the selection of the serving cell set.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum
- Improved uplink UE throughput

Capacity and Performance

In a network where both the Uplink Single-User MIMO and the NR Uplink Carrier

Aggregation features are enabled and UEs support both features, the updated

algorithm might lead to the selection of different serving cell sets, which might

impact uplink performance. If the bandwidth of the Mid-Band cell is large enough

compared to the bandwidth of the Low-Band cell, uplink SU-MIMO is initially selected

instead of uplink carrier aggregation with a Mid-Band and a Low-Band component

carrier with the updated algorithm.

The Average UL MAC UE Throughput KPI might improve.

The following PM counters monitoring uplink resource block symbol utilization

entities might be affected:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPusch1Port1Layer
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPusch2Port1Layer
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPusch2Port2Layer
- NRCellDU.pmRadioSchedUlSuMimoRankDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschMimoUserDistr

The following PM counters monitoring uplink carrier aggregation might be affected:

- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigAttUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigSuccUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigAttUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigSuccUl
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigUlSumSaDistr

- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolUlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolUlSCellExt
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlSCellExt
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlSCellExtBwp

Operation

The feature enhancement uses the

TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpUl2lCoverageThrOffset

attribute for coverage measurements in the current PCell and candidate PCell to

determine uplink two-layer coverage during the evaluations of the Multi-Layer

Coverage function.

The feature enhancement uses the

CaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute to select

the configuration mode when the UE is selected with a band combination for uplink

carrier aggregation or uplink 1TX-2TX switching. The configuration mode can be

selected for the uplink aspect of the SCell and PCell.
