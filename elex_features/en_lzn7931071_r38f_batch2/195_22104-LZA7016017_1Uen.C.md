Summary

The feature adds the configuration option to the NR Unified Access Control feature to

enable barring for the users that run mission-critical traffic.

Benefits

This feature has the following benefits:

- It helps to protect the gNodeB from overloading in case the number of mission-critical users is high. The feature offloads the air interface and helps the gNodeB load control functions to properly handle the high load conditions by reducing the intensity of connection attempts for users that run mission-critical traffic.
- It enables access prioritization for certain services for users that run mission-critical traffic. The feature enables the prioritization of access for specific groups of users and services by differentiating the barring directives between different access categories and PLMNs under high load conditions.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Unified Access Control for Mission-Critical Services

The feature enables the control of the UE barring policy for users running

mission-critical traffic.

If this feature is activated, the BarringGroup.startBarringAi2

attribute can be used to configure the barring policy for users that run

mission-critical traffic.

The feature can be used only if the NR Unified Access Control feature is activated.

Otherwise, as no UE barring takes place in the cell, the setting of the

BarringGroup.startBarringAi2 attribute takes no effect.
