Summary

This feature reduces UE power consumption by extending UE sleep time. When the feature is

active, the DRX cycle can be extended up to 2.9 hours. This can be used to improve

the energy efficiency of RedCap UEs.

This feature is supported on Low-Band and Mid-Band only.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature has the following limitations:

- UEs configured with eDRX are prevented from moving to RRC\_INACTIVE state and are moved to RRC\_IDLE state instead.
- The Paging.nS attribute must be set to 1 for this feature.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

The RedCap UE must support 3GPP Release 17 or later.

The AMF must support the eDRX functionality according to 3GPP, and the RedCap UE must request eDRX in the NAS Registration Request

message.

# 3 Feature Operation of Ericsson Reduced Capability Extended DRX

This feature enables extended sleep periods for RedCap UEs in RRC idle

state.

This feature introduces the NRCellDU.eDrxMode attribute to enable eDRX

in a cell for RedCap UEs in RRC idle state. The feature can be activated by

setting this attribute to IDLE.

This feature also introduces the Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx

attribute to define the time for which the received eDRX paging is retained or queued in

the RBS before it is discarded. For optimal eDRX paging performance, the

Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute must be set to

10 or greater. It is recommended to set the value of the

Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute to the maximum value of

20 seconds when the eDRX cycle is greater than or equal to 10.24

seconds. This is to reduce paging discards.

The Paging.nS attribute must be set to 1 to allow

setting the NRCellDU.eDrxMode attribute to a value other than

DISABLED.

If the Paging.nS attribute is set to a value greater than

1 during upgrade, the value of the

Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute is set according to the

following conditions instead of the default value of 10:

- If the Paging.pagingDiscardTimer attribute is set to 3 or lower, the Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute is set to the same value.
- Otherwise, the Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute is set to 3.

To activate the feature in this case, all cells in the gNodeB-DU must be locked and

unlocked to change both the Paging.nS and the

Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute to the required

setting.

# 4 Network Impact of Ericsson Reduced Capability Extended DRX

This feature affects paging and introduces IEs to multiple interfaces.

Capacity and Performance

Using eDRX increases downlink latency because RedCap UEs cannot respond

until the end of the sleep cycle. It is recommended for the RedCap UE

to only request eDRX in the NAS Registration Request message if all

expected mobile terminating communication is tolerant to delay.

Interfaces

This feature affects the following interfaces:

- NG-C This feature adds the NR Paging eDRX Information IE in the NGAP PAGING message.
- Uu This feature adds the hyperSFN-r17 and the eDRX-AllowedIdle-r17 IEs in SIB1.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Ericsson Reduced Capability Extended DRX

This feature introduces parameters to enable and configure eDRX. This feature can be

affected by existing attributes.
