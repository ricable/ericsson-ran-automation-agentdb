Summary

The RAN Grand Master feature uses GNSS as the primary reference clock, which is the time

synchronization source. The feature acts as a PTP Grandmaster clock and distributes

phase and time synchronization over Ethernet to connected PTP slave-only ordinary

clocks. The RAN Grand Master feature operates as a two-step clock.

The RAN Grand Master feature enables a cost-efficient way to provide a PTP Grandmaster at the

edge of the transport network.

The RAN Grand Master feature allows Quality Level Supervision of PTP references. The feature

inter-operates with PTP slaves and Boundary clocks.

# 2 Dependencies of RAN Grand Master

The RAN Grand Master feature has dependencies to different PTP variants.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other

features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

- When PTP over Ethernet is to be used on an Ethernet port that is part of LAG, make sure to configure PTP on the same Ethernet link at both ends.
- If PTP over VLAN is used: The tnPortId attribute of the TnPort MO indicates that a TN or an IDLe port is used for the VLAN. If a TN port is used, check that a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO refers to the VlanPort MO. To determine if a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO has to be used, refer to the transport network or the IP address plan. If the transport network or the IP address plan does not have any Bridge, InterfaceIPv4, or InterfaceIPv6 MO recommendations, create a Bridge MO. If an IDLe port is used, check that an ENodeBFunction MO instance is available, and the eranVlanPortRef attribute refers to the same VlanPort MO instance as the PtpBcOcPort MO does. The operState attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO must be set to ENABLED before configuring the PtpBcOcPort MO that points to the same VlanPort MO instance.
- Avoid using 1000BASE-T SFP modules that typically come with an RJ45 connector. Such SFP modules can cause PDV to exceed the node PDV tolerance limit, which results in disabled synchronization references. For 1000BASE-T connections, it is recommended to use RJ45 connectors on the front side of the unit. Alternatively use SFP-DAC cables.

# 3 Feature Operation of RAN Grand Master

The RAN Grand Master feature uses PTP over Ethernet Multicast to distribute the radio

time synchronization references to adjacent nodes. The Grand Master is time-synchronized

from the Radio Equipment Clock, that is connected through the SYNC port to a GNSS

receiver.

PTP packets are sent untagged over Ethernet, or tagged over

VLAN between nodes and the PTP grandmaster.

# 4 Network Impact of RAN Grand Master

When activated, the feature affects the Sync reference.

Capacity and Performance

While PTP Grand Master is activated, adding or removing the EthernetPort on a LagPort

causes Sync reference changed or temporary holdover in sub slaves.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for RAN Grand Master

Default, telecom, and custom profiles can be configured for this feature.

The following profiles can be set for the feature by configuring the

BoundaryOrdinaryClock.ptpProfile attribute:

| G_8275_1               |    | The G_8275_1 telecom profile requires PTP boundary                             clocks or transparent clocks to be present in every network element                             between the PTP grandmaster and the PTP slave. The value of the                                 PtpBcOcPort.announceMessageInterval attribute                             must be set to -3 for the G_8275_1                             profile.  If the G_8275_1 profile is configured, the Alternative                             BMCA is used, which sets the PTP ports into master state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| IEEE_1588_J3           |    | The IEEE_1588_J3 profile allows a higher PDV than the                                 G_8275_1 profile. The recovered clock accuracy is                             the same as for the G_8275_1 profile, the PDV is up to                             250 ns. If the sync message rate is at least 64 packets for each second,                             a PDV of up to 100 ns is tolerated. The recovered clock accuracy                             deteriorates and the locking time is increased to up to 90 minutes,                             which has an impact on the time features on the node.  If the IEEE_1588_J3 profile is configured and several                             grandmaster clocks exist in the PTP domain, the grandmaster clock uses                             standard BMCA to decide if it is the active or inactive grandmaster.                                                                                                                                                            |

This feature

introduces support for carrying  PTP packets over VLAN tagged

Ethernet.

The enhancement includes configuration parameters to enable or disable VLAN tagging.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The new MO

attribute, transportVlan is implemented to configure the VLAN ID

for each PTP port.

The tnPortId, attribute of the

TnPort MO indicates that a TN or an IDLe port is used for the

VLAN.

- When a TN port is used, a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO has to refer to the VlanPort MO.
- When an IDLe port is used, an ENodeBFunction MO instance has to be available, and the eranVlanPortRef attribute must refer to the same VlanPort MO instance as the PtpBcOcPort MO does. The operState attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO must be set to ENABLED before configuring the PtpBcOcPort MO that points to the same VlanPort MO instance.

Other Network Elements

VLAN tagged PTP messages are not supported by some third-party Grandmaster clocks.

Towards such clocks, untagged Ethernet can still be used.

Third-party boundary clocks also need to support PTP with VLAN tagging.

## Appendix A.c: 25.Q1.0: Increased BBU RAN Grand Master Availability in Small PTP Network

The feature enhancement introduces the custom synchronization profile for RAN Grand

Master feature, which increases its availability in small PTP network.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            | Optional                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces the LOCAL\_GRANDMASTER

synchronization profile for the RAN Grand Master feature. This profile is supported

for ORAN topologies where the RAN Grand Master is local to its vDU PTP Time

Receiver. In such topology, the packet network need for time error allocation is

small. Then, the Grand Master can use larger time error allocation for increasing

holdover capability for APTS reference. This is achieved by setting the value of the

BoundaryOrdinaryClock.ptpProfile attribute to

LOCAL\_GRANDMASTER. With such profile, the network limit for

Telecom Grand Master (T-GM) of 100 ns in ITU-T G8271.1 standard is not

fulfilled for Baseband RAN Grand Master. However, in small PTP network when the

local RAN Grand Master provides synchronization to its PTP Time Receiver, the total

time error is still within the specified 1,500 ns Antenna Reference Point (ARP)

limit.

For more details, see the ITU-T G8271.1 standard.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It improves synchronization robustness in cloud RAN configurations without extra cost for additional equipment and cabling.
- It allows the RAN Grand Master feature to use assisting PTS reference, which extends the availability for cells and services that require time synchronization, in case the primary GNSS reference becomes unavailable.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

With the feature enhancement, the user can set up a custom profile by setting the

value of the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.ptpProfile attribute to

LOCAL\_GRANDMASTER. This is only allowed, when the value of the

BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockType attribute is set to

GRAND\_MASTER\_ORDINARY\_CLOCK. With this change, the user is

allowed to create additional BoundaryOrdinaryClock MO instance,

which must be encapsulated in an AssistingReferennce MO. In this

case, the value of the BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockType attribute

must be set to SLAVE\_ONLY\_ORDINARY\_CLOCK with value of the

corresponding BoundaryOrdinaryClock.ptpProfile attribute set to

G\_8275\_2. Other combinations between RAN Grand Master

BoundaryOrdinaryClock MO class and other

BoundaryOrdinaryClock MOs are not allowed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version

24.16

24.4 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
