# 1 NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size Overview

The feature reduces latency by allowing larger uplink grants with more efficient use of

uplink resources as a response to a received scheduling request on PUCCH.

Summary

The NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size feature has the following benefits:

- Reduced latency and time to the first byte by allowing larger uplink grants
- Observability for each UE group with the UE Grouping Framework feature
- Parameterized functions for each UE group with the UE Grouping Framework feature

Usually larger uplink grants can waste uplink resources, because the gNodeB cannot determine

how much uplink resources are needed until BSR is received. This feature facilitates

setting a larger grant size and therefore helps to waste less uplink resources when

responding to a scheduling request on PUCCH.

Group level observability facilitation and uplink

greediness

configuration can be controlled by the specific attribute based on the UE Grouping

Framework feature. Depending on the setting, the scheduler can be

more

or less greedy in terms of uplink PRB allocation, when responding

to a scheduling request on PUCCH. The feature uses the UE Grouping Framework feature

to facilitate group-level observability and group-level function configuration.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size

This feature reduces latency and time to the first byte by allowing larger uplink

grants without wasting too many uplink resources.

Multiple MO instances can be used to find specific UE groups and configurations.

If no license is activated, a base MO instance is used with default attribute values.

# 6 Performance of NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size

The feature has several associated counters and affected KPIs.

Key Performance Indicators

Different factors and circumstances can

affect

some KPIs, and the impacts can be observed in the following cases:

- Using a larger value for the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute, because of the larger transport block for grant, can change the selected MCS.
- Using different configurations for the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSizeOpt attribute other than the default causes PRB allocation to be conservative.

KPIs related to the

following

can be affected:

- Active UEs
- BLER
- MCS
- PHR
- Transport block

These changes can be observed with the counters listed below.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size

Different configuration and optimization levels are available for this

feature.

The NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size feature can be configured in the following ways:

- Setting the value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSizeMode attribute to STATIC uses the value configured in the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute at all times, irrespective of the load.
- Setting the value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSizeMode attribute to ADAPTIVE overrides the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute for slots where PRB demand is high, and uses 32 bit as a value for the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute. This results in more available resources for other users and in the following cases: For slots where PRB use is low and the configured value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute is used For slots where PRB use is medium and the configured value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute is used Note: The BsrUeCfg.srGrantSizeMode attribute does not have any impact if its value is set to ADAPTIVE and the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute is set to the default value.

The NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size feature can be optimized at different levels in the

following ways:

- Setting the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute to higher values without enabling the NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size feature can lead to the waste of uplink resources when the actual required grant is small. For the optimal use, the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute can be set to a higher value, for example, between 3500 and 4000. It is recommended to observe the KPIs with three different settings, and compare with the KPIs on the same settings of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute.
- Setting the value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSize attribute to THROUGHPUT\_OPTIMIZED implies a behavior that uses more uplink resources to allow larger uplink grants. Setting the value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSizeOpt attribute to BALANCED helps to keep a balance between resource efficiency and TBS. Setting the value of the BsrUeCfg.srGrantSizeOpt attribute to RESOURCE\_OPTIMIZED minimizes PRB use, and only focuses on prioritizing the conservation of resources.
