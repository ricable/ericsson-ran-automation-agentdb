Summary

This feature improves time-based UE positioning by providing NR Timing Advance information

with high resolution. This is done when requesting NR Timing Advance measurements in

the E-CID positioning method through the NRPPa protocol.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Improved accuracy for measuring the distance between the UE and the antenna because of the ability to report the total range of NR Timing Advance values according to 3GPP TS 38.133
- Improved accuracy for estimating the UE location within the cell when NR Timing Advance measurements are requested with other positioning information, such as uplink AoA and SS-RSRP

This feature is applicable to Low-Band and Mid-Band cells in an NR standalone

deployment.

Hardware

This feature is applicable to RAN Compute units in RAN Compute groups 4 and 5.

For more information on RAN Compute groups, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Limitations

This feature only performs measurements for UEs that are in

RRC\_CONNECTED state and have a PDU session configured.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

The 5GC must support the NRPPa protocol version 17.2.0.

# 3 Feature Operation of High-Resolution Timing Advance for Macro Positioning

This feature allows the LMF to initiate on-demand NR Timing Advance measurements in

the NRPPa-based E-CID positioning method.

The LMF can initiate NR Timing Advance measurement requests if the value of the

NRCellCU.advUePosMode attribute is set to other than

NONE. NR Timing Advance measurements with high resolution can be

reported together with other information, such as uplink AoA and SS-RSRP, in the

NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message.

Operational Process of On-Demand E-CID Measurement

Figure 1   On-Demand E-CID Measurement

1. The LMF sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message to the gNodeB. This message contains the following information: Request for on-demand measurement reporting Request for NR Timing Advance measurements
2. The gNodeB receives the measurement request. If the gNodeB accepts the measurement request, the measurement calculation is performed based on the information received from the UE, and the process proceeds to step 3. If the gNodeB rejects the measurement request, the node sends back the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message to the LMF. The measurement request can be rejected because of the following reasons: The prerequisite feature is not activated. The NRCellCU.advUePosMode attribute is set to NONE. The UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state and it does not reply to the RAN paging procedure. No PDU session is established for the UE. A UE release or handover procedure is started for the UE.
3. The gNodeB sends back the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message to the LMF with the requested measurement information.
4. The LMF estimates the UE location based on the measurement information.

# 4 Network Impact of High-Resolution Timing Advance for Macro Positioning

High network load and many measurement requests might affect measurement

reporting.

Capacity and Performance

In case of high network load and many measurement requests, the measurement reporting

might be delayed.

Interfaces

NRPPa protocol 3GPP TS 38.455 version 17.2.0 or later is required for

this feature to be operable. For more information, see Compliance and Compatibility.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of High-Resolution Timing Advance for Macro Positioning

This feature allows the LMF to initiate UE measurements for positioning purposes. The

measurement results are reported to the LMF, where the UE positioning is calculated.

The gNodeB provides measurement data to the LMF with messages that can be used to

estimate the location of the target UE. The UE position is defined based on NR Timing

Advance information.
