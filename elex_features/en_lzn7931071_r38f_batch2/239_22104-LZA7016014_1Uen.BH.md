Summary

The Real-Time Security Event Logging feature captures real-time security events that occur in

the network and reports these for further handling in a comprehensive way. The

logged security events are sent to an external Syslog server that is compliant with

the RFC5424 and RFC5425 standards. This enables real-time feedback to detect threats

against the system. This is done by collecting security events from all nodes. The

content of the Syslog stream is identical to, or a subset of the Local

Security,

Audit Trail,

and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

logs.

This feature also provides a basis for the following activities:

- Analysis to respond to security breaches
- Assistance in the application of countermeasures to eliminate threats in progress
- Conformity with regulatory commitments and government requirements

# 2 Dependencies of Real-Time Security Event Logging

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No

specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No

known limitations.

Network Requirements

The

following must be fulfilled when using TLS:

- A trusted certificate used for the TLS verification must be installed. See Manage Security.
- The node credentials must be provided. See Manage Security.

# 3 Feature Operation of Real-Time Security Event Logging

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Real-Time Security Event Logging Overview

Process Steps

1. Collect local security event log information.
2. Filter received security event information. The required syslog streaming level can be set by using the Log.severityFilter attribute.
3. Send event information to Syslog server. Note: The O&amp;M Node Credentials and a trustCategory must be installed prior to starting the logging, to verify the authenticity of the SYSLOG servers in the network. It is also possible to send the security events to a Syslog server over a UDP connection. In this case, the Syslog server is not mutually authenticated and security events are sent in cleartext. This functionality cannot be configured through the MOM and can only be configured through AMOS. For security reasons, the use of unprotected UDP in field deployments is only recommended after careful consideration of the risks involved. Some risk can be reduced by using IPsec on the O&amp;M interface. The configuration of this functionality is then only available to the security administrator.

## 3.1 Collecting Local Security Event Log Information

The events that are sent to the Syslog server are compiled from locally provided security

events by Network Elements (NE). These events are saved in two log files in the node.

These logs behave in the same way after the introduction of Syslog function as they did

before. It is not possible to configure an event on node level that is only logged in

one log. The log files support Syslog rotation, but the storage time cannot be

configured.

The RTSEL feature includes a Log Event Receiver that is used to subscribe to the Event

Streaming service provided by the Log Service. The RTSEL feature specifies the set of

events that the Event Streaming service must immediately inform about, when the log

events are reported to the Log Service by logging clients. The logging clients can be

the following types:

- Security log
- Audit Trail log
- EDR log

For more information about available logs, see

Manage

Software.

## 3.2 Analyzing Received Security Event Information

The node supports the event filter functionality to enable the removal of events that are

not to be sent to the Syslog server. The RTSEL feature analyzes the received events and

processes the selected data. The filtered event information is converted to the Syslog

format, according to RFC5424. The Syslog message time stamps are based on UTC.

## 3.3 Sending Event Information to Syslog Server

Security events are sent directly to the Syslog server. The external Syslog interface

uses UDP or certificate-based TLS for mutual authentication between RBS and the external

Syslog server, according to RFC5424 and RFC5425.

The node name

syslog

APP-NAME

field is

used for tagging each event, and consequently distinguishing nodes in the external

Syslog Server. The APP-NAME can be configured with

ManagedElement.networkManagedElementId.

## 3.4 Feature Operation Status

Status information related to each Syslog server connection is indicated by the

LogPushTransfer.operationalState and the

LogPushTransfer.availStatus attributes.

If the connection to the Syslog server is broken, the node buffers events locally and sends

them to the server when the connection is re-established. The node is able to buffer the

latest 100 security events. If more events are logged during the outage, they are locally

stored in other log files. When connectivity is restored, the node only resends the last 100

security events to the Syslog server.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

For the full list of events, see Real-Time Security Event List.

# 7 Activate Real-Time Security Event Logging

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- The Syslog server is set up for reception of Syslog events.
- If a firewall is used between the node and the Syslog server, the node must be configured to allow the port number and the Syslog traffic.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4040010 MO instance on the Baseband Radio Node.
2. Configure the Real-Time Security Event Logging. For more information about configuration, see Manage Security.

After This Task

Make sure the Syslog server received the RTSEL: Logging

started event, if the severity filter is set up for the reception
