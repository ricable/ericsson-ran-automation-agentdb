# 1 PDCCH Capacity Boost Overview

The feature introduces capacity boost for PDCCH by the utilization of a power boost

to increase the efficiency of CCE allocation.

Summary

The PDCCH Capacity Boost feature replaces select large aggregation levels with smaller

aggregation levels and the aggregation level reduction is compensated with power

boost. The feature facilitates the rearrangement of the UE-Specific Search Space

(USS) to generate more PDCCH scheduling opportunities for each TTI. The feature

improves PDCCH blocking performance and increases PDSCH and PUSCH transmission

opportunities within the TTI.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved PDCCH allocation flexibility
- Improved PDCCH resource usage
- Improved PDCCH blocking rate

Hardware

The radio type and configuration are checked at cell setup for the support of PDCCH

capacity boost. Capacity boost is supported on all Massive MIMO radio units except

for AIR6488, AIR6454 and AIR3239. CPRI radio units do not support capacity

boost.

Limitations

The feature is only supported on TDD radio units.

The feature is only supported on Mid-Band cells.

The feature is not supported for cells with the following bandwidths:

- 10 MHz
- 15 MHz

The PDCCH Capacity Boost feature increases the power with 3 dB for the selected CCE

transmission. For deployments regulated by the Federal Communications Commision

(FCC), if the PSD level has reached or is close to the FCC PSD upper limit, then up

to 3 dB reduction on the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

attribute needs to be considered.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of PDCCH Capacity Boost

The feature has the possibility to trade large UE CCE aggregation levels for smaller

aggregation levels by compensating the smaller aggregation level with a CCE power

boost.

The feature is applied if the CCE resource of the cell is higher than eight. The USS is

configured adjusting to the cell bandwidth and configuration.

During PDCCH allocation, large aggregation levels are replaced with smaller aggregation

levels and a power boost is applied to compensate for the reduced number of CCEs in the

following ways:

- An original CCE aggregation level 16 is replaced with aggregation level 8 and boosted by 3 dB
- An original CCE aggregation level 8 is replaced with aggregation level 4 and boosted by 3 dB

For deployments where FCC regulations restrict EIRP PSD, the feature adjusts the PDSCH

power level in one of the following ways:

- Power level adjustment with Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit feature This option applies to the radio units that support Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP limit feature. EIRP PSD adjustment is derived from the following configuration and dynamically applied to PDSCH: The value of the SectorCarrier.maxAllowedEirpPsd attribute must be set to the same value as the EIRP PSD restriction. The value of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute must be set so that the carrier PSD is lower than the value of the SectorCarrier.maxAllowedEirpPsd attribute.
- Power level adjustment with configuration of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute This option applies to the radio units that are not supported by the Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP limit feature. To comply with the EIRP PSD requirement, the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute must be set so the carrier PSD is at least 0.8 dB lower than the EIRP PSD restriction.

# 4 Network Impact of PDCCH Capacity Boost

The feature improves PDCCH blocking rate, increases transmission opportunities and

the number of scheduling entities.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves the PDCCH blocking performance and increases PDSCH and PUSCH

transmission opportunities.

By utilizing power boosting, the feature allows smaller granularity in PDCCH resource

allocation. This results in more efficient usage of PDCCH CCE resources, which

increases the chance for PDSCH and PUSCH to get scheduled in the priority order. The

benefits of the feature are more pronounced in wider bandwidth.

For deployments where FCC regulations restrict EIRP PSD, up to 0.8 dB power backoff

is applied to downlink transmissions, which might slightly reduce cell coverage and

UE throughput.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
