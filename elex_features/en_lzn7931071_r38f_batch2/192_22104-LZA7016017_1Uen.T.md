Summary

NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements enables the collection of UE predefined

standard measurements, which are used as basic data for detection of false base

stations in a network. The radio measurement reports done by the UEs are collected

on the gNodeB as defined in 3GPP standards.

The collected data can be basis for the detection algorithm on Ericsson Security

Manager (ESM). The defined data are stored in cell or UE trace and compared with the

legitimate topology of mobile network.

Relevant

data can be

collected

for security threat analysis with ESM.

Additional

hardware is not

needed and the OPEX is reduced as well since dedicated drive tests

are not required.

The

operator is enabled to check if an area is abused by a false base

station and potential security attacks. Use of this feature enhances the public

perception towards the operator as being protective and concerned of the privacy of

subscribers.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature is supported on Ericsson gNodeBs and applicable to NR SA only. In case of

NR-DC deployment,

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature can be initiated only

by MgNB.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements

The feature enables data collection on

the gNodeB level for detection of potential false base stations.

The measurements are collected according to 3GPP TS 38.331 for the serving cells of the

UE and up to eight neighbor cells. The following data is collected:

- PCI of the serving cells and the neighbor cells
- RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR of the serving cells
- RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR of the neighbor cells for NR
- RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR of the neighbor cells for E-UTRAN

The following measurement types are supported:

- Inter-frequency NR
- Intra-frequency NR
- Inter-RAT frequency E-UTRAN

The following attributes can be used for feature configuration:

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence of NR Security-Initiated UE

Measurements

1. The operator configures the measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature in the gNodeB according to MOM capabilities.
2. The UE inactivity is determined in the gNodeB and the UE is selected for the measurements.
3. The gNodeB configures the UE to perform the measurements by sending the RRCReconfiguration message. For particular UE, gNodeB configures the maximum number of NR frequencies to measure based on the UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas attribute.
4. The UE confirms the RRC connection reconfiguration with the RRCReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE is reconfigured and performs all configured measurements.
6. The UE sends the measurement results to the gNodeB in the MeasurementReport message.Note: The total number of UE measurement reports that can be received from the UE can be significant. It depends on setting of the following parameters: UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas: determining the maximum number of NR frequencies to measure on reportConfigPeriodical.reportAmount under the UcmNrFreqRelProfile class: determining the number of reports that can be received per particular frequency If the value of the UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas attribute is 7 and that of the UcmNrFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodical.reportAmount attribute is 2 for all NR frequencies, the total number of measurement reports the gNodeB can expect from UE is 7x2=14.
7. The CuCpUeUcmNrReport and CuCpUeUcmEutranReport PM events are generated at reception of the last measurement report and they are sent to the ENM.
8. The ESM receives PM event data from ENM for detection of false base stations.

If the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature is active, then

the

measurements remain ongoing for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature even if the

NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature is deactivated. Both features need to

be deactivated for

measurements

for the NR UE

Coverage Measurements feature to be deactivated.

## 3.1 UE Inactivity Determination

It can be determined that the overall UE activity state can be changed from RRC\_CONNECTED

to RRC\_INACTIVE or RRC\_IDLE if the following conditions are met:

- NAS timer is expired.
- Sn bearer inactivity is reported.
- Inactivity on all bearers is detected.
- UE is not already performing a measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature.

UEs that are about to change the RRC\_CONNECTED activity state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE

might be used to perform UE coverage measurements. A UE that is selected to perform a

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature does not change UE

activity state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE while it is performing

the

measurement for the time determined by timer tUcm.

## 3.2 UE Selection

If the following conditions are met, all UEs that become inactive might be selected for

performing the

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- UE capability indicates that the UE can perform measurement on at least one frequency. The UE needs to support frequencies as indicated by supportedBandListNR IE in UE-NR-Capability under rf-Parameters or supportedBandListEUTRA IE in UE-NR-Capability under interRAT-Parameters.
- The UE belongs to an NR cell for which measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature are configured by setting the UcmCellProfile.ucmEnabled attribute to true.
- The UE has not already performed a measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature previously during the same UE inactivity. Only one measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature is allowed for each UE inactivity state.
- The probability for an inactive UE to be selected for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature, which is the value of the UcmCellProfile.ucmSelectionProbability attribute, allows measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature to start on that UE.

## 3.3 UE Coverage Measurements Intensity Determination

The intensity that

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature is started on a given NR

frequency is decided by the following steps:

1. By setting the value of the UcmCellProfile.ucmCellTargetIntensity attribute, it is determined how often measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature needs to be started in certain NR cell.
2. By setting the value of the UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor or UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor attribute, it is determined how much more often the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature needs to be started on particular NR or E-UTRAN frequency.

The values of the

UcmCellProfile.ucmCellTargetIntensity,

the

UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor,

and the UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor

attributes are verified against CPU load protection to finally determine the number of

NR or

E-UTRAN frequencies that can be configured for

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature on the UE.

The total number of NR

and E-UTRAN

frequencies that can be configured for

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature in one second cannot

exceeded 100.

## 3.4 Timer tUCM

The timer tUCM delays changing the UE RRC\_CONNECTED activity state from ACTIVE to

INACTIVE in gNodeB while waiting for measurement reports to be received from UE.

tUCM duration can be calculated using the following timer formula:

tUCM = initial\_meas + max[(ucmReportAmount\_fi

-1)*ucmReportInterval\_fi]

In the formula:

| initial_meas         |    | initial_meas = 200 ms + n×480 ms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

# 4 Network Impact of NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements

The feature provides

configuration of periodic data collection of coverage measurements from UEs and reporting

them as PM events.

Capacity and Performance

When using this feature,

the

last received measurement report from a UE generates a PM event

CuCpUeUcmNrReport or

CuCpUeUcmEutranReport and increases the

load in the gNodeB. The increasing number of PM events also increases the load on

the transport network when they are transmitted to the ENM.

Interfaces

The feature increases the load on the Uu interface in the following situations:

- UE measurements are initiated or terminated
- The UE sends measurement reports to the gNodeB

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements

As

measurements

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature can be used by various

features at the same time, the following point needs to be considered during

configuration:

- Because only one RRCReconfiguration message can be sent to UE to order UE to perform measurements, UE measurement configuration requirements of all features need to be coordinated on the gNodeB level, such as the definition of MOM configuration for cell using the UcmCellProfile attributes, corresponding NR frequencies using the UcmNrFreqRelProfile attributes, and corresponding E-UTRAN frequencies using the UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile attributes.

The PM counter NRCellCU.pmSaUeMeasurementReportUcm counts the number

of received

reports

due to the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature. If the number of

received

reports

for the NR UE

Coverage Measurements feature needs to be decreased, consider

decreasing values of the following cell-level attributes in

configuration

of the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- UcmCellProfile.ucmCellTargetIntensity
- UcmCellProfile.ucmSelectionProbability
- UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas

The following frequency-level attributes under the UcmNrFreqRelProfile

and

UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile

MO

classes

can also be considered for decreasing the number of received

reports

due to the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor
- ReportConfigPeriodical.reportAmount
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor
- ReportConfigPeriodicalEuUtran.reportAmount

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The periodic trigger for UE measurement provides unbiased UE measurements for E-UTRAN.
- Taking measurements when the UE is inactive has less impact on UE performance.
- The target measurement intensity is configurable for each cell.
- Dedicated PM events mean less filtering of events by receivers.
- This common data source for the collection of UE measurements can be used for the development of off-node features.

Capacity and Performance

Using the framework of the

NR

UE Coverage Measurements feature generates RRC signaling between

the RBS and the UE, which increases the load on the Uu interface. The load is

increased when UE measurements are initiated and terminated, and when the UE sends

measurement reports to the RBS.

When using the

NR

UE Coverage Measurements feature,

the

last received measurement report from a UE generates a PM event

and increases the load in the RBS.

The increasing number of PM events also increases the load on the transport network

when they are transmitted to the ENM.

Operation

This feature

enhancement introduces

the

following MO class and

attributes

for configuration of

the NR UE

Coverage Measurements

feature

for

E-UTRAN:

- EUtranFreqRelation.ucmEUtranFreqRelProfileRef
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodicalEutran
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.reservedBy
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmEUtranFreqRelProfileId
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor

This feature

enhancement introduces

the

following PM

events

for the

reports

received from

UEs for the NR

UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- CuCpUeUcmNrReport
- CuCpUeUcmEutranReport

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.1 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier ENM

versions.
