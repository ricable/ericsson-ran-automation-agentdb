Summary

This feature introduces observability for maximum delay times on DRB or UE level. Downlink

maximum delay times can be observed in Low-Band, Mid-Band, and High-Band cells.

Uplink maximum delay times can be observed in Low-Band and Mid-Band cells.

Measurements can be performed every second. The delay times are measured in

milliseconds for DL counters and 125 microseconds for UL counters.

The feature can help to track and troubleshoot issues that occur if PDB is exceeded.

Additional Information

For more information about PDB, see 3GPP TS 23.501; System architecture for the

5G System (5GS).

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Enhanced Slicing Observability

This feature provides observability for maximum packet delay times.

For downlink, Radio Link control (RLC) delay time is measured from the arrival of each

DRB packet in the gNodeB to the draining of the last byte of the packet from the RLC

layer for initial scheduled transmission. This feature introduces EBS counters to

observe the maximum of the measured RLC packet delay time values in milliseconds for

each DRB in Low-Band, Mid-Band, and High-Band cells. Measurements can be performed every

second, and they are used to observe the packet delay time that exceeds the PDB.

For uplink, the maximum Medium Access Control (MAC) delay times are measured in 125

microseconds and can be observed every second in Low-Band and Mid-Band cells according

to the following time measurements:

- The maximum latency between the reception of the PUCCH scheduling request (SR) and the PDCCH grant for each UE.
- The maximum duration of the restricted scheduling state for each RB, measured for each LCG corresponding to a given DRB.Note: This measurement shows the approximate upper bound of packet delay. Low values indicate no issue. Because of sensitivity to traffic pattern, it is possible to have high values of restricted time while having low packet delay.
- The maximum delay between the reception of new data in an empty buffer and the first PDCCH grant for each RB, measured for each LCG corresponding to a given DRB.

Measurements can be filtered by multiple categories, for example, the following

elements:

- PLMN
- S-NSSAI
- UePowerClass

Maximum packet delay time is only measured on the PCell. Therefore, carrier aggregation

can cause a considerable delay in the arrival of the last byte of each DRB packet from

the SCell to the UE.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The feature introduces the following PM counters, which are used to observe the

uplink measurements:

- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeUlResDrbMaxQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacInitSchedDelayUlMaxQos

The feature introduces the following EBS counters, which are used to observe the

maximum delay time:

- pmEbsnMacInitSchedDelayUlMax
- pmEbsnMacInitSchedDelayUlMaxDistr
- pmEbsnMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatMaxDistr
- pmEbsnMacTimeUlResDrbMax
- pmEbsnMacTimeUlResDrbMaxDistr
- pmEbsnRlcDelayTimeDlMaxDistr
- pmEbsnRlcDelayTimeDlMax

The introduced EBS counters are associated with the NRCellDU MO.

For more information on the EBS counters associated with this feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

In case of Carrier Aggregation, the observability for uplink measurement is provided

for both PCell and Scell.

The pmEbsnMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatMaxDistr EBS-N counter is only

incremented on the PCell because PUCCH scheduling requests (SR) can only be

scheduled on the PCell.

The following EBS-N counters are incremented on the PCell for both SCell and PCell

scheduling:

- pmEbsnMacTimeUlResDrbMax
- pmEbsnMacTimeUlResDrbMaxDistr
- pmEbsnMacInitSchedDelayUlMax
- pmEbsnMacInitSchedDelayUlMaxDistr

The following PM events are updated to include the maximum delay time:

- DuPerUeTrafficRep
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRep
- DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10
