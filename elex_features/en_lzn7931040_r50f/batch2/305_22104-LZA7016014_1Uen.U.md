Summary

The LTE QoS feature coordinates and assigns the appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) to

other functions in LTE RAN. The RBS maps QoS parameters to bearer parameters for different

Data Radio Bearers (DRBs) in the LTE radio interface and for different data flows in the

transport network.

The LTE QoS handling complies with the 3GPP QoS concept, see 3GPP TS

23.203. It provides traffic separation in downlink by supporting multiple parallel

bearers. To provide traffic separation in the uplink, an operator-configurable mapping is

offered between Quality of Service Class Identifiers (QCIs) and Logical Channel Groups

(LCGs), in addition to multiple bearers. Service prioritization is enabled by mapping QCIs

to logical channel priorities used by the User Equipment (UE) for uplink rate control.

The QoS handling is part of LTE Basic system functions. OSS is used to configure the

feature

# 2 Dependencies of Quality of Service

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No special hardware requirement is expected for this feature.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

QoS handling is part of the LTE Basic system functions. No specific licences are

required to activate QoS handling. OSS is used for easy configuration of QoS

parameters.

# 3 Feature Operation

QoS handling is based on mapping QCIs received from the core network

to RBS-specific parameters. This makes it possible to have different

priorities and DSCP values. This enables the transport network to

prioritize between different data flows over the S1 and also the X2

interface (see Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover). Configuration

of DSCP is described in Transport Network Configuration.

Services with different QCIs are mapped to different data radio

bearers. This separation achieves benefits for the end-user QoS as

it removes the risk that one service such as file download would block

the traffic for a voice call.

In uplink, the Scheduler grants resources based on Logical Channel

Groups. The distribution of the granted resource, internally within

the UE, is done for each logical channel using a rate control function

based on logical channel priority.

If a QCI outside the set of standardized QCIs (see 3GPP TS 23.203) is received, a default behavior is defined

by a default (or fallback) QCI unless the QCI was specified by the

feature Operator Defined QCI.

All QoS class identifiers defined by 3GPP are supported, 3GPP TS 23.203.

In OSS, the priorities associated with the QCIs can be configured. For Standardized QCIs

(1-9) default values for the priorities are selected according to 3GPP TS

23.203. QCIs that are treated according to the default (or fallback) QCI are all given

the same priority. The priority of the default QCI is configurable; its default value is

selected to be lower than priorities for the standardized QCIs. For the uplink, priorities

associated with QCI are mapped to logical channel priorities. These logical channel priorities

are sent to the UE, which prioritizes between its logical channels.

Mapping QCI to DSCP for the S1 and the X2 interface can be configured in OSS.

The following figure shows an example of:

- QCI 1-3 mapped to LCG 1
- QCI 4-6 mapped to LCG 2
- QCI 7-9 mapped to LCG 3
- Other (non-standardized) QCIs mapped to LCG 3

It is also possible to map QCIs to LCG 0. One needs to be aware

that SRB1/2 is mapped to LCG 0. This means that any traffic mapped

to LCG 0 will inherit scheduling settings of SRBs in uplink, see QoS-Aware Scheduler.

Figure 1   Example of Mapping of Logical Channels to LCG. QCIs 0, 10-255

are mapped to the default QCI.

The DSCP setting determines the priority for the data stream in

the IP transport network. The DSCP values may also be mapped to Ethernet

Priority Bits (P-bits), the values of which are used on Ethernet layers.

This mapping is described in Transport Network Functions and Transport Network Configuration.

Several QCIs can be mapped to the same DSCP value. QCIs that are treated according to the

default (or fallback) QCI are all given the same configurable DSCP value. Multiple RBSs can be

configured in parallel from OSS.

See the Managed Object Model (MOM) for default values.

## 3.1 High Level Feature Flow Chart

An example of using QoS support is to map voice on QCI 1 and to

let QCI1 be assigned to its own logical channel group.

An overview of the QoS framework is shown in the following figure:

Figure 2   QoS Overview. QCIs 0 and 10-255 is mapped to the default

QCI.

# 4 Parameters

Parameters related to QoS include those introduced by the feature,

and other network parameters affected by the QoS function.

## 4.1 Feature Configuration Parameters

The managed object configuration QciProfilePredefined has Managed Object (MO) QciTable as parent.

The parameters that related to QoS handling are described in the

following table:

Table 1   Parameters for Each QCI

| Parameter                                          | Description                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| logicalChannelGroupRef                 TOOLTIPFLAG | Controls the mapping of QCI to logical channel group. Default is that QCIs are mapped to LCG 1.         |
| dscp                 TOOLTIPFLAG                   | Controls the mapping of QCI to DSCP. By default, each QCI is mapped according to a recommended setting. |
| priority                 TOOLTIPFLAG               | QCI related priority. By default, each QCI is mapped to a priority according to 3GPP TS 23.203.         |

## 4.2 Affected Parameters

The implementation of this feature affects no parameters.

# 5 Network Impact

QoS handling affects the overall behavior of LTE RAN and directly

influences the scheduling of DRBs and user plane performance. It also

has impact on the transport network by prioritizing between data flows.

Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs) are assigned a higher priority

than Data Radio Bearers (DRBs). SRB1 has higher priority than SRB2.
