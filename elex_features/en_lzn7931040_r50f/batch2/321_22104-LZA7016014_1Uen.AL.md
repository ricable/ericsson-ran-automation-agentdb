Summary

Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling improves uplink UE throughput

and PRB resource utilization for large-buffer UEs with good channel conditions,

identified as data-aware UEs. This also increases uplink average UE throughput and

uplink cell throughput. This is achieved by ensuring that data-aware UEs are scheduled

more frequently, and are allocated more radio resources than by the basic Scheduler

function.

This licensed feature supports both TDD and FDD. It can be enabled or disabled at cell

level.

# 3 Feature Operation of Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling

The feature schedules data-aware UEs more frequently, and allocates more uplink PRBs to

them when scheduled.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling Operation

Process Steps

Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling runs in every subframe in every cell where it is

enabled.

1. The uplink Scheduler identifies the data-aware UEs from all valid UEs, and increases their scheduling weight. A UE is identified as data-aware UE when the following conditions are met: The number of data-aware UEs to be selected is set by the MOM attribute noOfUlImprovedUe. The feature is disabled if the attribute is set to 0. The scheduling weight of the selected data-aware UEs is increased, so that PDCCH resources are allocated to them. This ensures that PUSCH resources are allocated to the data-aware UEs.
    - The UE has reported large BSR to the eNodeB, indicating that it has large data in the buffer to transmit.
    - The UE has good channel conditions, that is, low pathloss and high SINR.
2. In PUSCH resource allocation, small-buffer UEs are given higher scheduling priority, and data-aware UEs are forced to be scheduled last. This avoids increasing the latency of small-buffer UEs. The function of forcing the data-aware UEs to be scheduled last can be enabled and disabled using the attribute ulImprovedUeSchedLastEnabled in MO Classes EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD. This function is enabled by default.

## 3.1 Scheduler Overview

The Scheduler feature distributes radio interface and RBS

resources between various user and control data flows requesting transmission in the

cell. It gives priority to robust system control signaling and retransmissions over

user data. It enables users to be multiplexed and scheduled in time and frequency,

efficiently using spectral and hardware resources to optimize user throughput and

cell capacity.

Scheduling, also referred to as DRA, is done dynamically

for every TTI of 1 ms. For every upcoming TTI, the Scheduler determines the users

that are assigned radio interface and RBS resources.

The Scheduler feature is a basic feature, and part of

radio resource management. It adapts automatically to variations in traffic load and

distribution, and considers possible UE limitations, reducing the need for

configuration and optimization by operators. However, the operator can control some

of the scheduler behavior, such as for PDCCH and PUCCH resources, to meet specific

needs. These adjustments can have a direct impact on user peak throughput and cell

capacity.

The feature supports SU-MIMO in the downlink, which

improves coverage and peak bit rates.

## 3.2 Process Steps for Uplink Scheduling

Figure 2   Uplink Scheduling Procedure

1. A UE to be scheduled sends a scheduling request to the uplink Scheduler to indicate that it has data in the buffer, and asks uplink scheduling to start allocating uplink PRBs to the UE in upcoming subframes. Scheduling requests are sent on PUCCH and uses PUCCH format 1. The number of scheduling request resources available on the PUCCH per cell can be configured with MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers.
2. At the beginning of each TTI, the Uplink Scheduler receives the following information: PUCCH and PRACH have absolute priority over other control and user data channels in the uplink. So the scheduling elements for uplink scheduling are the resources not used by PUCCH and PRACH.
    - List of available PRBs
    - Logical channels with data to transmit
    - Scheduling requests, indicating that there is data in the UE buffer requested to be scheduled
    - BSR, indicating uplink buffer status of the UE
    - Information on power headroom
3. If resources are available, the Scheduler checks the Baseband capacity.
4. A UE to be scheduled is chosen based on the priority and scheduling weight of its radio bearers. As uplink scheduling involves both the node and the UE, resources are allocated per UE. When the Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling feature is activated and enabled in the cell, large-buffer UEs with good channel conditions, that is, data-aware UEs, are given increased scheduling weight. This ensures that data-aware UEs are scheduled more frequently, and more uplink PRBs are allocated to them when scheduled.
5. A UE to be scheduled is validated to ensure that it is in RRC Connected state, synchronized, and data is in the buffer. The random access response message on PDSCH contains the grant for random access message 3 (RRC connection request).
6. When a UE is scheduled in a subframe, the uplink Scheduler allocates resources to the UE. The uplink Scheduler grants some resources to every UE using normal HARQ operation which is given the possibility to receive a grant in that TTI. The uplink Scheduler determines the number of PRBs allocated to a UE based on BSR and channel quality information. Note: FDD only: UEs configured for TTI Bundling transmit in four consecutive TTIs after reception of a grant in that TTI. When ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation is enabled in uplink, using the EUtranCellFDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive or EUtranCellTDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive MOM attribute, a random selection is made as to the allocation must start at the lower or the upper part of the spectrum.
7. The maximum number of scheduling requests can be set by the EUtranCellFDD.dsrTransMax orEUtranCellTDD.dsrTransMax attribute. Note: After the set number is reached, the UE connection fails on PUCCH, and the Random Access procedure starts.
8. The uplink Scheduler sends a scheduling grant to the scheduled UE, indicating the PRBs and transport format to use for uplink transmission. Uplink grants are sent on PDCCH.
9. The UE transmits the uplink data, and together with it sends the BSR to the node.

## 3.3 Scheduling Priority

Scheduling Priority

The Scheduler feature, in every cell in every TTI, determines which UE is assigned

resources. Scheduling is based on priorities, that is, the scheduling weight

attached to the radio bearers.

A higher scheduling priority gives the radio bearer a higher probability to obtain

resources, and enables the UE to perform transmission or reception. Resources are

allocated per UE. The UE priority is defined as the highest scheduling priority of

the radio bearers belonging to the UE, including retransmissions. The UE with the

highest priority is selected first for transmission.

Among logical channels, common channels are given the highest priority:

- BCCH, for system information data
- CCCH, for random access messages
- PCCH, for paging messages

These transmissions are given scheduling weights so that the transmissions get

absolute priority. These transmissions also have link adaptation. Link adaptation is

done to reach the cell edge with a certain probability of decoding, determined by

the link budget.

The Scheduler can allocate the remaining resources to DTCH, after the resources for

Layer 1 and Layer 2 control signaling have been allocated.

Uplink Scheduling Priority

Uplink scheduling is done on a UE basis. So, while a UE is selected based on the

priority of one of its radio bearers, it uses its scheduling grant to transmit by

all of its bearers, including those with lower priority.

Uplink scheduling priorities are shown in the table:

Table 2   Uplink Channel Priority

| Direction   | Channel Priority                           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Uplink      | 1. Transmission of random access message 3 |
| Uplink      | 2. HARQ retransmissions                    |
| Uplink      | 3. Initial transmissions of DCCH           |
| Uplink      | 4. Initial transmissions of DTCH           |

HARQ retransmissions are given higher priority than both DCCH and new data

transmissions on DTCH, because synchronized HARQ retransmissions are used.

# 4 Network Impact of Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling

The feature increases the uplink UE throughput for data-aware UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling feature increases the uplink UE throughput for

data-aware UEs, leaving small-buffer UEs unaffected. The average uplink UE

throughput gain is significant in high loaded cells, and slight in medium or low

loaded cells.

When Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling is enabled and the cell load is very high, the

latency of small-buffer UEs can slightly be increased.

Interfaces

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling

Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling can be enabled or disabled at cell level by setting the MOM

attribute noOfUlImprovedUe in MO Classes EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD. This attribute sets the

number of data-aware UEs. Data-aware UEs are the candidates to get improved uplink radio

resources. Value 0 disables the feature, and any value higher than 0 enables it. The

feature is enabled at activation with the attribute noOfUlImprovedUe automatically set to

1.

Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling can be configured by setting the MOM attribute bsrThreshold in MO Classes EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD. The attribute is used to

identify data-aware UEs.

If the attribute bsrThreshold is set to a

value different from 0, a UE is identified as data-aware when the Buffer Status Report

(BSR) of it reported to the eNodeB is higher than bsrThreshold.

If the attribute bsrThreshold is set to 0,

UEs are identified as data-aware by the eNodeB automatically.

The default value of bsrThreshold is 0.

To avoid increased latency for small-buffer UEs, it is possible to force the data-aware

UEs to be scheduled last in PUSCH resource allocation. This function can be enabled by

setting the MOM attribute ulImprovedUeSchedLastEnabled in MO

Classes EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD TRUE. The function is

enabled by default.
