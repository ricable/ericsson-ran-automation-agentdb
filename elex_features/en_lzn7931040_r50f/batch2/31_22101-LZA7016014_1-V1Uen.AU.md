# 2 Benefits of RAN Data Collection

RAN Data Collection enables the use of UEs as measurement equipment to collect

predefined measurement data from the network.

RAN Data Collection allows a more detailed analysis of UE measurements in the network,

such as the estimation of the geographical location of users.

The information collected in the RAN is available to other network elements through

streaming. This allows real-time network performance monitoring and an immediate

response to traffic conditions.

The features included in the RAN Data Collection value package provide the following

benefits:

- Enhanced location accuracy for UE tracing
- Enhanced UE measurement data for performance monitoring
- Instantaneous availability of network traces

Summary

The Minimization of Drive Tests feature provides a remote method for troubleshooting

or verification of the radio network that is simpler and cheaper than traditional

drive tests. The feature provides a tool to optimize network planning with the MDT

measurement data, including location information.

The traditional drive test, where vehicles with measurement equipment are used for

analyzing network coverage and capacity, is costly and requires planning and

coordination of resources. In the field, it is desirable to use automated drive test

solutions, involving UEs, for easier operation.

3GPP specified MDT so that standard mobiles can be used for measurements to provide

data for the operators. This includes GNSS location information if available in the

UEs. The feature provides a simpler, cheaper, and remote method to use for

troubleshooting or verification of the radio network.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature provides tools to configure and run UE

measurements according to 3GPP specifications. From these UE measurements, the

operator can collect information required to monitor and fine-tune UE behavior in

the network.

UE measurements are configured for each cell. All UEs within a cell have the same

measurement configuration. The start and stop of UE measurements are controlled

using the OSS.

For example, mobility measurements can be fine-tuned without changing the actual

configuration of the mobility measurements and without disturbing normal traffic

behavior. Using PM counters, statistics can be gathered about the radio environment

and UE behavior can be observed within a specific cell.

This feature enables the configuration of two separate intra-frequency E-UTRA

measurements, inter-frequency E-UTRA measurements, or both. It also supports the

configuration of separate inter-RAT measurements for UTRA or GERAN. A total of six

measurements can be configured.

The UE measurement is started by including at least one specific PM event in a Cell

Trace or UE Trace Subscription Profile. The information from the measurements is

available in the form of PM events and PM counters.

The PM counters are connected to one of the PM events, and are referred to as RES

counters. The counters for individual cells provide statistical results of the

PM-initiated UE measurements in those cells.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

Although they are similar to normal trace collecting, using the Streaming of Events

feature puts additional load on the following elements:

- Node processor
- Memory use
- O&amp;M link capacity

This feature allows for the streaming of traces to a customer without waiting for

each ROP to be completed. Live cell event traces are streamed through TCP. UE traces

are streamed through UDP.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The eNodeB measures the noise and interference of each receiver antenna branch and

PRB. This feature provides observability for each PRB and antenna branch by

detecting external interference.

External uplink interference degrades performance, particularly in terms of coverage

area and throughput rate. This feature allows for the remote investigation of uplink

interference for each PRB and antenna branch. This improves troubleshooting

possibilities and reduces the need for third party tools to measure

interference.

of UpPTS is important.

The UpPTS Interference Reporting feature improves the troubleshooting of a TDD

configuration by improving the observability of interference with finer

granularity.
