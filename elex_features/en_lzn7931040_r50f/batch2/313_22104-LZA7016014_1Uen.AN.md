# 1 Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X Overview

The Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature makes it possible to offer voice services to

LTE UEs without requiring IMS VoIP support. This feature also allows other Circuit Switched

services (like SMS, LBS) to be offered to LTE UEs.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature enables eNodeBs to respond to Circuit Switched service requests from an LTE UE

with single RX configuration.

The feature can reduce the call setup time when compared to the CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature.

The Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature complements the functions offered by the CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature. These functions can

still be used when the enhanced functions cannot. Enhanced functions cannot be used

together because of the following reasons:

- because of UE capabilities
- inability of the UE to provide a 1xRTT measurement report
- failure along the enhanced CSFB procedures

The only exception is when the multi-RAT CSFB functionality is supported and                     configured. The multi-RAT CSFB functionality can be configured through the                     following attributes to choose GERAN and UTRAN or CDMA 1X as the target CS                     fallback RAT:  PlmnInfo.actualPlmn     PlmnInfo.csfbTargetRat     If CDMA 1X is not chosen as the target CS fallback RAT, GERAN and UTRAN can                     be chosen.

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

The feature provides enhanced CSFB mechanisms that rely on UE measurements, active

outgoing handover, and pre-allocation of 1xRTT resources before moving the UE to CDMA

1xRTT.

Operational Process

1. Once the feature is enabled, the eNodeB broadcast SIB8 messages to the UE containing 1xRTT CSFB registration information.
2. After the UE connects, it can initiate 1xRTT CS registration based on the SIB8 information received.
3. If 1xRTT CS registration is initiated, the UE sends a CSFB parameter request to the eNodeB.
4. The eNodeB sends the CSFB parameters to the UE and at reception, the UE can send a registration request to the eNodeB. Note: If the band class in the CSFBParametersResponseCDMA2000 message is same as what the UE received in SIB-8, the UE does not initiate registration on the 1xRTT network over S102. It is possible to force the UE to initiate 1xRTT CS registration by sending a dummy value for the CDMA band class in the CSFBParametersResponseCDMA2000 message. Setting the attribute EUtranCellFDD.dummyCdmaBandClass or EUtranCellTDD.dummyCdmaBandClass to a dummy band class value that is not used in the native CDMA 1xRTT network and by setting the powerUpReg flag to TRUE in SIB-8 will force the UE to do 1xRTT registration over S102 after it returns to LTE from CDMA 1xRTT calls. If registration is not forced when the UE moves across LTE and CDMA 1xRTT, the UE has to be paged in both networks for a given time until the UE performs the next registration in the CDMA 1xRTT network. This increases the paging load. By forcing registration each time the UE transitions between LTE and CDMA 1xRTT, the network knows where to reach the UE thus reducing the paging load.
5. The eNodeB tunnels the 1xRTT CS registration request in an Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunneling message to the MME.
6. The MME sends the 1xRTT CS registration response in a Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunneling message to the eNodeB which sends it to the UE.
7. After 1xRTT CS registration, the UE can either go back to RRC\_IDLE, or stay in RRC\_CONNECTED.

In the following scenario, when the UE either makes a Mobile Originating call, or is about

to receive a Mobile Terminating call, the following occurs:

1. The UE is E-UTRAN RRC\_CONNECTED or E-UTRAN RRC\_IDLE and registered in 1xRTT.
2. The UE user either performs an MO CS call, or is about to receive an MT CS call.
3. The UE sends a CSFB request by sending a Non-Access Stratum Extended Service Request to the MME. The UE requests the CSFB service either as a response to a user activity, or as a response to a paging message with a CSFB flag.
4. The eNodeB receives either an S1AP UE context modification request, or an S1AP UE Context Setup Request that indicates that CSFB is required.
5. If the UE is eCSFB capable and time and phase synchronization deviation does not exceed the threshold defined in ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationCdma2000, the eNodeB starts the UeMeasControl.csfbHoTargetSearchTimerand orders the UE to perform a B1 or B2 measurement by sending the appropriate report configuration. The selection for performing a B1 or B2 measurement is based on the UE capabilities. The eNodeB includes the list of carrier frequencies and cells on which the UE must measure. This list is based on the following criteria: When B1 and B2 measurements are triggered, all other reporting configuration must be removed, except the configuration for A2 "critical", just if Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is enabled. The eNodeB performs a Release with Redirect if an A2 poor coverage report is received while waiting for the eCSFB related measurement report.
    - UE capabilities
    - CSFB frequency priorities defined with the Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio attribute for each available frequency relation.
6. If a B1 measurement or B2 measurement report arrives from the UE, the eNodeB stops the UeMeasControl.csfbHoTargetSearchTimer and start handover preparation procedures with the UE.
7. At reception of an uplink handover-preparation-transfer message from the UE, the eNodeB sends the handover request in the Uplink S1 CDMA2000 tunneling message.
8. The eNodeB receives a Downlink S1 CDMA2000 tunneling message with successful handover status.
9. The eNodeB sends a MobilityFromEUTRACommand message to the UE to confirm successful handover to 1xRTT.
10. The 1xRTT Mobile Originating or Mobile Terminating Call is established.
11. The eNodeB selects a frequency to perform the redirection if one or more of the following conditions are true: The selection is based on the following criteria:
    - The UE is not eCSFB capable.
    - Time and phase synchronization deviation exceeds the threshold defined in ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationCdma2000.
    - No measurement reports are received from the UE.
    - The handover procedure was unsuccessful.
    - UE capabilities
    - CSFB frequency priorities defined with the Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio attribute for each available frequency relation. When several possible target frequencies have the same priority, the eNodeB applies a circular search scheme for the selection. Frequencies that have previously been measured, but with no measurement reported by the UE, are not included on the selection.
12. As an alternative, the eNodeB initiates a blind connection release with redirection.
13. The UE synchronizes with the new Radio Access Technology (RAT) and connects to the indicated target frequency.
14. The 1xRTT Mobile Originating or Mobile Terminating Call is established.

# 7 Activate Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature is activated.
- The network is configured so that the CSFB returning UEs are routed to the correct MME. For more information, see MME Selection Algorithm in Radio Bearer Service.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011513 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011513 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

This licensed feature enables to configure the cells to broadcast SIB8, which

contains the information that UE needs to perform 1xRTT CS registration and idle mode

re-selection to the CDMA2000 1xRTT network.

- A license for the CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature is activated.
- A license for the Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X feature is activated.
- CDMA2000 1xRTT coverage must be supplied in the area covered by the LTE cell.
- The LTE single radio UE must have CDMA2000 1xRTT and Enhanced Circuit Switched Fallback (eCSFB) to 1xRTT capabilities.
- Cells must be configured to broadcast SIB8 which contains information and parameters required by the UE to perform 1xRTT CS registration and idle mode re-selection to the CDMA2000 1xRTT network. To ensure that SIB8 is broadcast, it must be mapped to an SI message.
- The CDMA2000 system time to broadcast in SIB8 must be configured. EUtranCellFDD.initCdma2000SysTimeType or EUtranCellTDD.initCdma2000SysTimeType can be set to either SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS.
- At least one defined frequency relation for mobility must be provided. The Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation MO class represents a frequency relation. If the number of CDMA 1xRTT frequencies is high, increase the value of the UeMeasControl.maxMeasCdma20001xRtt attribute.
- The default settings for B1 measurement and B2 measurement must be adjusted so the supported event is reported from the UE. The default settings not triggers the event report.
- To configure the UE to measure on appropriate 1xRTT targets or to configure redirection of the UE at eCSFB failure, information about the CDMA2000 1xRTT carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during network configuration. The carrier frequency information is sent to the UE during the measurement report configuration or during the redirection process. It helps the UE in measuring and finding the CDMA2000 1xRTT frequency. A Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation and a corresponding Cdma2000Freq MO class must be created for each CDMA 1xRTT frequency where it must be possible to handover or redirect the UE.
- The MME must support S102 interface, messages, and procedures for tunneling CDMA2000 information.
- The 1xCS IWS must support S102 interface, messages, CSFB and eCSFB procedures.
- The ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationCdma2000 parameter must be set to 10 µs.
- The ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment attribute must be set to TRUE. This allows eNodeBs to synchronize using clock source over GPS with time and phase synchronization. Note: When time and phase synchronization deviation exceeds the limit defined in ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationCdma2000, eCSFB to CDMA2000 1xRTT is disabled and the alarm ServiceDegraded is raised for cells which have this feature enabled.
