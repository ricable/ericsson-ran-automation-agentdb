# 3 Feature Operation of S-GW Relocation at X2 Handover

The feature manages the S-GW change process between the source and the target node

connected to the same MME.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   S-GW Relocation at X2 Handover Sequence

Process Steps

1. The source node and the target node perform an X2 handover. An X2 relation must exist between the source and target nodes so that an X2 handover can be performed. In addition, both the source and target nodes must be connected to the same MME. For a detailed process flow, see Intra-LTE Handover.
2. At the end of the handover execution, the target node sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to the MME.
3. The MME responds to the target node with a PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. In this message, if the MME is to change the S-GW, a new Transport Layer Address and a GTP TEID for the new S-GW are included. The source node then starts to use the new S-GW after updating the Transport Layer Address and the GTP TEID.

# 6 Performance of S-GW Relocation at X2 Handover

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters or events.

# 7 Activate S-GW Relocation at X2 Handover

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011479 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate S-GW Relocation at X2 Handover

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011479 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
