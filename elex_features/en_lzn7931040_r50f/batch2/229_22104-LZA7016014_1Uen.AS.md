Summary

The OTDOA User Plane Location Support feature enables the operator to configure the

Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) that forms the basis for the OTDOA method defined

in 3GPP (introduced in 3GPP release 9). The operator determines the periodicity of

the radio frames containing PRS and the number of subframes transmitting PRS for

each transmit occasion. A sequence of subframes (1, 2, 4, or 6) transmitting PRS is

referred to as a "PRS occasion". To minimize the interference in the PRS subframe,

no other data is scheduled in those subframes. These subframes are therefore

referred to as LISs.

The UE measures PRSs from multiple eNodeBs along with geographical information of the

eNodeB positions and their relative downlink timing, an estimate of the UE position

can be established.

The feature also enables the eNodeB to provide precise cell frame timing to the

OSS, from where the positioning node can retrieve

this information. The positioning node is in the user plane architecture called SLP.

Knowledge of cell timing by the positioning node is a prerequisite for the OTDOA

method.

FDD only: In the LISs, where the PRSs are transmitted, no user data is scheduled. This means

that some of the downlink cell capacity is lost. Capacity loss depends on the

periodicity of the PRS frames and the number of subframes in each PRS occasion. In

the worst case, with a periodicity of 160 ms and six consecutive subframes, the

downlink capacity loss is 3.75%. A more typical scenario with a periodicity of 1,280

ms and four consecutive subframes gives a loss of only 0.31%.

TDD only: In the LISs, where the PRSs are transmitted, no user data is scheduled. This means

that some of the downlink cell capacity is lost. Capacity loss depends on the

periodicity of the PRS frames, the number of subframes in each PRS occasion and the

number of downlink subframes per radio frame. In the worst case, with a periodicity

of 160 ms and all downlink subframes used for PRS, the downlink capacity loss is

6.25%. A more typical scenario with a periodicity of 1280 ms and four out of six

downlink subframes used for PRS gives a loss of only 0.52%.

The OTDOA method provides sufficient positioning accuracy (50-200 m) to serve as a

fallback method for the A-GPS method and enables the operator to comply with the FCC

phase 2 accuracy requirements on positioning of emergency calls.

Standalone, it can serve as the positioning method for a wide variety of commercial

services based on UE location.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The eNodeBs must be synchronized using the Clock Source Over GPS feature, or the

IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

feature. If the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

feature is used, the PTP input accuracy must be 150 ns or better. The accuracy is

calculated according to the ITU-T G.8275.1, and the ITU-T

G.8271.1 guidelines. The required PTP input accuracy must be accounted

for during network planning. The eNodeBs can not detect an absolute time error.

# 3 Feature Operation of OTDOA User Plane Location Support

Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) broadcasting occurs in a cell where the feature is

activated. The broadcasting can be configured by the

operator.

Low Interfered Subframes

If the data region in a PRS subframe contains Physical Downlink Shared Channel

(PDSCH) data, the accuracy of the estimated UE position is decreased due to

increased interference. Therefore, no scheduling of PDSCH transmissions in PRS

subframes is done, which also reduces the impact of OTDOA on the scheduler.

Power Scaling

Power scaling of PRS depends on whether the eNodeB is configured for one or two

cell-specific TX antenna ports. Since PRS is only transmitted from one antenna (for

each transmit occasion in case of two cell-specific TX antenna ports), the following

scaling of the amplitude applies to PRS:

APRS =

√Na*Areference

Since the only values for Na are 1 and 2, the scaling when two antennas

are used will result in a doubling of the power of the PRS resource elements on the

antenna where PRS is transmitted.

Mapping of Resource Elements

Figure 1   Mapping of PRS for One or Two Antenna

# 4 Network Impact of OTDOA User Plane Location Support

The feature affects transmission capacity in the cells where positioning is

activated.

Capacity and Performance

The non-transmission of user data in the subframes where the Positioning Reference

Signals (PRSs) are transmitted results in a somewhat reduced capacity in the cells

where positioning is activated.

FDD only: The capacity loss is in the range 0.078% to 3.75%, corresponding to the

lowest and highest frequency possible of PRS subframe transmission. A typical

scenario with a periodicity of 1,280 ms and four consecutive subframes gives a loss

of 0.31%.

TDD only: The capacity loss is in the range 0.13% to 6.25%, corresponding to the

lowest and highest frequency possible of PRS subframe transmission. A typical

scenario with a periodicity of 1,280 ms and four out of six downlink subframes used

for PRS gives a loss of 0.52%.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of OTDOA User Plane Location Support

The activation of this feature requires user consent.

This feature enables the operator to configure the Positioning Reference Signals (PRSs)

that forms the basis for the OTDOA method defined in 3GPP.

The UE measures PRSs from multiple eNodeBs along with geographical information of the

eNodeB positions and their relative downlink timing, an estimate of the UE position can

be established.

The OTDOA method provides sufficient positioning accuracy (50-200 m) to serve as a

fallback method for the A-GPS method and enables the operator to comply with the FCC

phase 2 accuracy requirements on positioning of emergency calls. This also means that

the customer's location information will be known.

# 8 Deactivate OTDOA User Plane Location Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010962 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for OTDOA User Plane Location Support

Certain cell parameters that are needed for location support must be configured

before activating the feature.

Entering Cell Parameters

The first step in the activation is to enter the cell parameters needed for location

support. These parameters are defined in the EUtranCellFDD MOs. If

location support is defined for a new cell, some generic cell parameters must be entered as

well. For more information on the generic parameters, see Manage Bearers and Services.

The parameters can be grouped as follows:

- Cell identification parameters (if this is a new cell)
- Cell frequency and cell power parameters (if this is a new cell)
- PRS configuration parameters
- Cell geographical parameters
- Cell timing parameters
- Feature activation parameter on cell level

Lock and Unlock Cell

To put the cell parameters (entered in Entering Cell Parameters) into effect, the cell must be manually locked and unlocked. The cell parameters above

can also be entered when the cell is in the locked state and the parameters will then take

effect when the cell is unlocked. Here "take effect" means that the Positioning Reference

Signals (PRSs) are transmitted in accordance with the parameter values set in the previous

step. Scheduling of user data is stopped in those subframes where PRS is transmitted.

When unlocking the cell, the GNSS time stamp for the latest occurrence of SFN0 is

retrieved and the corresponding read-only MOM parameters are set by the eNodeB.

These MOM parameters are updated whenever a change of synchronization state takes

place in the cell.

## 9.1 Unlock Cell Fails because of Erroneous Parameter Setting

If the cell does not become active, the operator must try another setting before

trying to unlock the cell.

FDD only: When the operator uses the EUtranCellFDD.prsConfigIndex

parameter to set the Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) period and PRS subframe offset,

the eNodeB checks that this setting does not cause a collision in the air between the

PRSs and the SIB1 message and between the PRSs and the CSI RSs.

TDD only: When the operator uses the EUtranCellTDD.prsConfigIndex

parameter to set the PRS period and PRS subframe offset, the eNodeB checks that this

setting does not cause a collision in the air between the PRSs and the SIB1 message,

uplink or special subframes and between the PRSs and the CSI RSs.

If there is a collision between the PRSs and the SIB1 message, the cell does not become

active and the operator must try another setting before trying to unlock the cell. An

alarm is issued that in the Additional text will state

Parameter setting not supported: prs.

FDD only: This is interpreted as "Current PRS setting will cause collision with SIB1 and

is thus not acceptable, try another PRS setting".

TDD only: This is interpreted as "Current PRS setting will cause collision with SIB1,

uplink or special subframes and is thus not acceptable, try another PRS setting".

If there is a collision between the PRS and the CSI RSs, the cell does not become active

and the operator must try another setting before trying to unlock the cell. An alarm is

issued that in the Additional text will state parameter setting is not supported, which

means unsupported CSI RS configuration. This means that the current PRS setting causes

collision with CSI RS or Current CSI RS configurations are not supported. As this is not

acceptable, try another PRS or CSI RS setting.
