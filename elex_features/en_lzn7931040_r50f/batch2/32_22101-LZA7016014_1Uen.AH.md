# 1 Maximum Cell Range Identity

| Value Package Identity:   | FAJ 801 0422   |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Introduced in:            | LTE RAN L15B   |
| Standards:                | 3GPP 36.211    |

# 2 Benefits of Maximum Cell Range

Increased coverage

With

Maximum Cell Range, the range of typical rural or coastal sites in lower bands is at

least doubled.

Extends the standard cell range

from

15 km to 100

km.

Increased resource utilization

The

rural 2G/3G site grid can be reused.

# 3 Maximum Cell Range Business Values

CAPEX Reduction: Increased Coverage

Coverage is

cost

efficient,

because there is no need for new sites in large areas with low

traffic.

OPEX Reduction: Fewer Sites to Operate and Manage

Maximum Cell

Range

reduces

OPEX.

There is

no

need for extra

sites,

which limits operational

costs,

such as energy consumption and

maintenance.

# 4 Included Functions

## 4.1 Maximum Cell Range Overview

The Maximum Cell Range feature increases maximum cell range in sparsely populated

areas.

| Feature Name           | Maximum Cell Range                                                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 0869                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Maximum Cell Range                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0422                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Maximum Cell Range feature supports for a maximum cell range of 100 km for FDD and 93 km

for TDD. Without this feature, the maximum cell range is 15 km. Large cells are

suitable to obtain coverage in sparsely populated areas where the need for capacity

is low. Examples of such areas are deserts, coastal areas, or sea environments.

## 4.2 Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km Overview

The feature extends the signal range from an eNodeB to over 100 km.

| Feature Name           | Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km                                           |

| Value Package Name     | Maximum Cell Range                                                         |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature provides support for a maximum cell range beyond 100 km for FDD. Large cells are

suitable to obtain coverage in sparsely populated areas where the need for capacity

is low. Examples of such areas are deserts, coastal areas, or sea environments.

Depending on geographical environmental characteristics and certain atmospheric

conditions, the actual cell range can optimally reach 200 km. This is double the

distance standardized by 3GPP.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Easier coverage of large rural areas
- Communication with distant nautical vessels in coastal areas
- Possibility to leverage cell capacity to gain larger coverage in various deployment scenarios
- Substantial cost reduction while maintaining LTE service in sparsely populated regions
