Summary

The Internal MCE feature can be used together with the LTE Broadcast feature for file

download and for streaming services, for example, mobile television. This solution

is based on the 3GPP standardized MBMS. The eMBMS describes the MBMS servies in EPS,

including LTE and WCDMA access

A multicast solution allows for a more efficient use of radio resources than a

unicast solution. The Internal

MCE

feature

allows

the LTE Broadcast feature to operate without the need to set up

additional centralized MCE nodes.

# 3 Feature Operation of Internal MCE

The Internal MCE

feature performs admission control and allocation of radio resources used by all eNodeBs in the

MBSFN Area.

The following areas are affected by the Internal MCE.

- Configuration of eNodeBs
- M3 interface connection handling
- eMBMS session handling

## 3.1 Description of Feature Operation

The Internal MCE feature allocates the radio resources for the LTE Broadcast

service.

LTE Broadcast is a point-to-multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a single

source entity to multiple recipients. It is based on eMBMS that was included in the 3GPP

release 9 specifications. For an overall description of the E-UTRAN eMBMS functionality,

see

3GPP TS 36.300.

The eMBMS is realized in the 3GPP specifications by the addition of

several

new capabilities to existing functional entities of the 3GPP architecture

and

the addition of new functional entities.

Figure 1    eMBMS Architecture Deployment

The Broadcast

Multicast-Service

Center (BM-SC) controls eMBMS sessions and corresponding eMBMS bearers.

3GPP allows two deployment alternatives in LTE RAN:

- Centralized MCE Architecture
- Distributed MCE Architecture

Ericsson LTE RAN only supports the distributed MCE architecture.

The eNodeB performs admission control and the allocation of radio resources used in the MBSFN

area. There is no communication between eNodeBs regarding the configuration of the MBSFN

areas. All eNodeBs must be configured with the same parameter values for the specific MBSFN

areas.

## 3.2 M3 Connection Handling

The feature needs M3 connections to operate. M3 connections require license

activation.

To establish the control plane for the Internal MCE, M3 connections must be set up to one or

several MMEs. These are the same MMEs as used for S1, but different MMEs can be also set up.

Since the MCE functionality is built into the eNodeB, the M2 interface is not supported.

To set up M3 connections, the license for the Internal MCE feature must be activated.

For more information about MME node selection and M3 connection handling, see Manage Mobility

## 3.3 eMBMS Session Handling

The MME starts the eMBMS sessions used by the feature. A session is stopped by the MME

or two ways of time-out.

The internal MCE function in the eNodeBs accepts a session start request message from the

MME. It means that it responds with the session start response message if the following is

fulfilled:

- The message contains a TMGI (Temporary Mobile Group Identity) that is configured in the MbmsService MO.
- A Service Area Identity included in the message is configured in any of the MbsfnArea MOs.

Sessions continue running even if the M3 connection is lost. When the M3 connection is

re-established, repeated session start messages are expected. These are accepted for an

already running session if the session parameters are unchanged.

To ensure that sessions are started and stopped simultaneously in multiple eNodeBs, it is

recommended to include the optional information elements Time of MBMS Data Transfer and Time

of MBMS Data Stop in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST and MBMS SESSION

STOP REQUEST messages on the M3 connection.

An eMBMS session can be stopped in the eNodeB in the following ways:

- eMBMS session stop by MME
- Session duration time-out
- Audit time-out

### 3.3.1 eMBMS Session Start

The eMBMS session is initiated by the MME and requires the fulfillment of several

conditions.

After an M3 connection is set

up, the eNodeB is ready to receive an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message from an MME.

Figure 2   Session Start

Procedure

for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for EPS (from TS23.246)

eMBMS Process Steps

1. The eNodeB validates the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message. If validation is successful, the eNodeB accepts the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message by sending MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE. Otherwise the eNodeB sends MBMS SESSION START FAILURE. The following items are validated:
    - The license for the LTE Broadcast feature is activated.
    - The eNodeB belongs to the indicated MBMS Service Area. No further check is done to ensure that the Service Area Identity is configured in the MbsfnArea.
    - The Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI) is configured in the eNodeB. The TMGI is used in the eNodeB to identify the MbmsService MOs to activate.
    - If the MBMS session indicated by the TMGI is already started, it is checked to confirm that the session parameters are unchanged. A changed MME M3 Application Protocol ID is accepted.
2. The eNodeB validates if it is possible to activate the MBMS session. If it is not possible, the information is saved in the eNodeB. The session is activated when the problem is resolved. The following conditions must be fulfilled:
    - The corresponding MbsfnArea.administrativeState MO instance set to UNLOCKED.
    - The subframes of the corresponding MbsfnArea do not overlap with another activated MbsfnArea.
    - The Transport Network Admission Control allows the bit rate of the multicast transport bearer.
3. The eNodeB waits until just before the Time of MBMS Data Transfer indicated in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message before proceeding.
4. The eNodeB sets up the IP multicast tunnel, joins the transport network IP multicast address, and enables the reception of MBMS session data from the specific IP multicast source address.
5. The radio resources in the eNodeB are allocated according to the preconfigured settings. If a cell is configured as an MbsfnArea reserved cell or the transport tunnel could not be set up, the subframes that belong to the MbsfnArea are blocked from unicast traffic, and the eMBMS data is not transmitted.
6. MBSFNAreaConfiguration is sent to UEs on MCCH in a synchronized way.

### 3.3.2 eMBMS Session Stop by MME

The eMBMS session can be stopped by the MME using MBMS common channel

messages.

Figure 3   Session Stop Procedure for E-UTRAN and UTRAN for

EPS

1. The eNodeB always accepts the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message.
2. The eNodeB uses the MME or MCE M3 Application Protocol ID to find an activated session or a session in a waiting state.
3. If the conditions are fulfilled, the eNodeB waits until the Time of MBMS Data Stop indicated in the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message before proceeding.
4. If the last session is stopped in the MbsfnArea, the MbsfnAreaConfiguration message on MCCH is updated, or the eNodeB stops sending the MbsfnAreaConfiguration.
5. The radio resources for the corresponding MbsfnArea are reallocated in the eNodeB.
6. To disable reception of MBMS session data, the eNodeB leaves the transport network IP multicast address and the IP multicast tunnel is released.
7. The MBMS session context is deleted in the eNodeB.

### 3.3.3 MBMS Session Stop by Session Duration Time-out

The eMBMS session can be stopped if a predefined time period ends.

If the session duration time indicated in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST

message ends before the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message is

received, the eNodeB

stops the

session.

1. If the last session is stopped in the MbsfnArea, the MbsfnAreaConfiguration message on MCCH is updated, or the eNodeB stops sending the MbsfnAreaConfiguration.
2. The radio resources for the corresponding MbsfnArea are deallocated in the eNodeB.
3. To disable reception of MBMS session data, the eNodeB leaves the transport network IP multicast address and the IP multicast tunnel is released.
4. The MBMS session context is deleted in the eNodeB.

If a session has a duration time message set to zero, as indicated in the

MBMS SESSION START

REQUEST,

it is not stopped by this mechanism.

eMBMS Session Stop by Audit Time-out

### 3.3.4 eMBMS Session Stop by Audit Time-out

The eMBMS continues if the M3 connection is broken. The session ends only if the

configured time period is over and no request for re-establishment of M3 received.

The

eMBMS sessions also continue running

if

there is

a

failure of the M3 connection on which they

are

started. If the M3 connection is not re-established, the sessions keep running until session

duration

time-out.

If the M3 connection is re-established, the MME sends new session start messages for the

ongoing

sessions.

A session is stopped if no such message has been received within the time period configured

in the parameter

Mbms.tMbmsAuditTimer

.

This is done to stop sessions for which MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST messages

cannot

be received when the M3 link

is

down.

1. If the last session is stopped in the MbsfnArea, the MbsfnAreaConfiguration message on MCCH is updated, or the eNodeB stops sending the MbsfnAreaConfiguration.
2. The radio resources for the corresponding MbsfnArea are deallocated in the eNodeB.
3. To disable reception of MBMS session data, the eNodeB leaves the transport network IP multicast address and the IP multicast tunnel is released.
4. The MBMS session context is deleted in the eNodeB.

## 3.4 eMBMS Control Plane Synchronization

The feature ensures that the MCCH content is updated within the same modification

period border in each cell.

Synchronized radio interface transmission from the cells controlled by different eNodeBs

has

some prerequisites.

These

ensure that the MCCH content is updated at the same modification period border in each cell

that belongs to the same MBSFN Area.

For the distributed MCE architecture, the synchronization

for a

session start is based on the Time of MBMS Data Transfer in the MBMS

SESSION START REQUEST message. The eNodeB applies the MCCH update from the last

modification period before the

Time of MBMS Data Transfer. The synchronization for session stop is based on

Time of MBMS Data Stop in the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST

message. The eNodeB applies the MCCH update from the first modification period after the

Time of MBMS Data Stop.

# 7 Activate Internal MCE

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011555 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Internal MCE

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011555 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Internal MCE

The Internal MCE feature is configured using the Mbms,

TermPointToMmeM3, and MceFunction MO

classes.

The operator identically configures in all eNodeBs that use the distributed MCE architecture

the following:

- the MCE functions distributed to the eNodeBs
- the radio resources using eMBMS

The MBMS Service Area Identities that the eNodeB belongs to are configured in the

MbsfnArea MO.

Figure 4   Managed Object Model for Internal MCE.

The LTE RAN must be configured to prepare for LTE Broadcast.

Other nodes, such as MME, MBMS GW, BM-SC are ready to run LTE Broadcast. These nodes are not

LTE RAN nodes, therefore they are not included in LTE RAN CPI.
