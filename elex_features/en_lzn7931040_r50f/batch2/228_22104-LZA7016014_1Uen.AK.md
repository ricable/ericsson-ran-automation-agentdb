| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |

Summary

The feature mutes PRS signals at times when there is a possibility of interfering with a

neighboring cell.

Without PRS management, neighboring cells can transmit their PRS at the same time and

cause interference. PRS management enables different cells to transmit at different

times by muting some of the cells at certain times.

PRS signals are sent from all cell antennas at the same time. The different arrival times are

used for positioning.

The feature offers the following benefits:

- Less interference between neighboring cells during PRS transmissions, which results in more accurate PRS measurements. Therefore, more accurate coordinates of the location of the UEs are obtained.
- A higher capacity when compared with OTDOA solutions without PRS muting.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

This feature depends on the correct operation of the E-SMLC node.

# 3 Feature Operation of OTDOA PRS Management

The feature allows PRS muting by using PCI assignment or muting pattern

configuration.

The feature provides a way to configure the transmission and to mute the PRS. In addition,

the power boost and the transmission scheme parameters associated with PRS can be

configured.

The PRS muting algorithm can be adjusted in the following ways:

- Assigning the PCIs
- Configuring the muting pattern bit length

Example of PRS Muting Pattern Set to 4-Bit Length

The following example describes a PRS muting pattern set to 4-bit

length.

In Figure 2, cells with different colors have

different frequency shifts and do not interfere with each other. There are six frequency

shifts available. The algorithm to allocate cells to different frequency shifts is as

follows:

1. The frequency shift group ID equals PCI mod 6, therefore it is a value in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
2. The cells are further grouped for PRS transmission and muting purposes.
3. Cells with PCI 0-5 take one of the PRS transmission opportunities, cells with PCI 6-11 take another, and so on.

# 4 Network Impact of OTDOA PRS Management

This feature can improve capacity.

Capacity and Performance

The OTDOA function affects capacity given the bandwidth required for PRS signals. The OTDOA

PRS Management feature has a positive effect on capacity. By muting some PRS transmissions

in a cell, the bandwidth at the muting points becomes available for other traffic.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

This feature depends on the correct operation of the E-SMLC.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of OTDOA PRS Management

This feature provides information about how to configure OTDOA-based calculations.

The feature offers less interference between neighboring cells during PRS transmissions,

which results in more accurate PRS measurements. Therefore, more accurate coordinates of

the location of the UEs are obtained.
