# 1 Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission Overview

The Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature introduces an efficient and flexible

algorithm for polling the downlink Radio Link Control (RLC) status in acknowledged mode,

both for SRBs and DRBs.

Summary

The Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature improves retainability for eNodeBs in

high-load conditions and for UEs in poor radio conditions.

This feature dynamically increases and optimizes the poll interval based on current

bearer conditions. This feature reduces unnecessary poll-retransmissions, and

extends the time to declare RLF in downlink without affecting the poll behavior for

other UEs.

Additional Information

For detailed information about the configuration of the feature, see Manage Bearers and Services.

# 3 Feature Operation of Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission

The Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature uses the

DataRadioBearer and SignalingRadioBearer MO classes for

configuration.

The time taken to declare RLF for a bearer is the product of values of the following

attributes:

- DataRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold
- SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold
- DataRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl
- SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl

Without the feature enabled, attempting to extend the time to declare RLF by increasing

DataRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold and

SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold results in degraded DRB

throughput in high eNodeB load. Increasing

DataRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl and

SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl results in wasted radio

resources.

With this feature enabled, a shorter default poll interval can be used, because the poll

interval dynamically increases according to the current bearer conditions, and always follows

the current ARQ Round Trip Time (RTT). This reduces unnecessary poll-retransmissions, and

extends the time to declare RLF on downlink without impacting poll behavior for other UEs.

The updated algorithm uses DataRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl and

SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl as a starting point for

calculating the poll-retransmission interval on DRBs and SRBs in downlink. It then checks the

current ARQ Round Trip Time, and gradually increases the interval. The poll interval can be

increased up to 500 milliseconds.

The DataRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold and

SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold attributes specify the number of

poll-retransmission attempts before declaring RLF on downlink.

Table 2   Difference of Poll Interval and Time to RLF with Feature Activated

| Feature State   | Number of poll retransmissions        |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |    6 |    7 | 8     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-------|
| DEACTIVATED     | Poll interval in milliseconds         |  80 |  80 |  80 |  80 |  80 |  80 |   80 |   80 | 80    |
| DEACTIVATED     | Time since initial Tx in milliseconds |   0 |  80 | 160 | 240 | 320 | 400 |  480 |  560 | 640*  |
| ACTIVATED       | Poll interval in milliseconds         |  80 |  80 |  80 | 160 | 320 | 500 |  500 |  500 | 500   |
| ACTIVATED       | Time since initial Tx milliseconds    |   0 |  80 | 160 | 240 | 400 | 720 | 1220 | 1720 | 2220* |

In Figure 1 default MOM values are used and

ARQ RTT is below threshold.

The time to RLF can be extended further, if it is configured for up to 16 or 32

retransmissions. For more information, see Radio Bearer and Quality of Service.

## 3.1 Optimization of RRC Connection Release on Cell Level

The RRC Connection Release procedure can be optimized on cell level by reducing the

RLC retransmissions.

The Optimized RRC Connection Release Control feature can be set on the cell level to

complete or replace the following attributes:

- SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold
- SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl

The feature allows the configuration of the maximum number of RLC retransmissions and

maximum time of poll retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure on cell

level. The parameters of the feature can function separately.

The following attributes take effect if the Optimized RRC Connection Release Control

feature is enabled:

- The feature uses the following parameters to indicate the maximum number of RLC retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure: EUtranCellFDD.dlMaxRetxRrcReleaseThr EUtranCellTDD.dlMaxRetxRrcReleaseThr Note: If the license is disabled, or the parameter values are set to -1, the SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold attribute takes effect.
- The feature uses the following parameters to indicate the maximum time of poll retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure: EUtranCellFDD.tPollRetxRrcReleaseDl EUtranCellTDD.tPollRetxRrcReleaseDl Note: If the license is disabled, or the parameter values are set to -1, the SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl attribute takes effect.

# 4 Network Impact of Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission

The Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature can improve retainability and integrity

during high load and poor radio conditions. Improved integrity means that less radio resources

are wasted.

Capacity and Performance

Retainability and integrity during high load and poor radio conditions are improved.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
