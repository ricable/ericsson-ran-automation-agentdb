# 1 Flexible Channel Bandwidth Overview

The feature makes the channel bandwidth flexible by blocking PRBs on the edges of the

channel bandwidth from being used.

Summary

The feature makes the channel bandwidth flexible by blocking PRBs on the edges of the

channel bandwidth from being used. By reducing the spectrum occupied by LTE, more

spectrum becomes available for other technologies, for example GSM.

In uplink, UEs are not scheduled on PUSCH in PRBs that are blocked and PUCCH is not

allocated in PRBs that are blocked, if the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature is used.

In downlink, UEs will not be scheduled on PDSCH in PRBs that are blocked. Control

channels and reference signals can be transmitted in blocked PRBs, but can also be muted.

# 2 Dependencies of Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature is related with several features.

Feature

Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Power boost function is not supported when NB-IoT is deployed in LTE network.

Sub-band SRS allocation is not supported in cells with channel bandwidth 5 MHz.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

System Functions

| Function   | Description                                                                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capacity   | Blocking PRBs reduce the capacity in both downlink and                                     uplink.   |
| Throughput | Blocking PRBs reduce the throughput in both downlink and                                     uplink. |

# 3 Feature Operation of Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature uses parameters to provide room for other technologies besides LTE by

blocking PRBs in the channel bandwidth.

The feature reduces the channel bandwidth by not using PRBs on the edges of an LTE

channel to make room for other technologies, like GSM. It is recommended that the same

PRBs on both uplink and downlink are blocked. The feature supports asymmetric blocking

of PRBs between uplink and downlink. PRBs can be blocked only on the low edge or the

high edge or on both edges of the channel.

The feature cannot guarantee to fulfill the requirements in 3GPP TS 36.104: Base Station

(BS) radio transmission and reception for the reduced bandwidth. The requirements are

fulfilled for the configured channel bandwidth which is one of the following:

- Channel Bandwidth 5 MHz
- Channel Bandwidth 10 MHz
- Channel Bandwidth 15 MHz
- Channel Bandwidth 20 MHz

Flexible Channel Bandwidth functionality and A-MPR can fulfill some of the additional

spectrum emission requirements according to 3GPP TS 36.101, User Equipment (UE) radio

transmission and reception. Refer to PUCCH Overdimensioning.

Figure 1 explains how the feature

changes the channel bandwidth by blocking the use of PRBs.

Figure 1   Example of PRB blocking

The parameters

EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion

and EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion

control the

total number of PDSCH scheduling PRBs. The parameters

EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart

and EUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart

control the

number of the PRBs not scheduling PDSCH on the low edge of the channel.

The parameters EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive and

EUtranCellTDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive control the muting of

blocked PRBs, that is, the following:

- PDCCH
- PCFICH
- PCHICH
- CRS
- CSI-RS
- PRS

In addition, the parameters EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost

and EUtranCellTDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost control the power boost for

non-blocked PRBs in the channel, when the following are muted:

- PDCCH
- PCFICH
- PCHICH
- CRS
- CSI-RS
- PRS

The parameters

EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion

and EUtranCellTDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion

control the

total number of PUSCH scheduling PRBs. The parameter

EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart

and EUtranCellTDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart

control the

number of the PRBs not scheduling PUSCH on the low edge of the channel.

The parameters EUtranCellFDD.pucchOverdimensioning and

EUtranCellTDD.pucchOverdimensioning ensure that PUCCH is

allocated on PRBs within the wanted channel bandwidth. Use PUCCH Overdimensioning,

In uplink, this means that no spectrum is used by LTE on the blocked PRBs if PUCCH

Overdimensioning is used and Sounding Reference Signal is disabled.

In downlink, the whole frequency spectrum is used by LTE for control channels and

reference signals, according to 3GPP specifications. Because of that, the UE expects

control channels and reference signals to be available on the whole channel bandwidth.

If control channels and reference signals are muted in the blocked PRBs, the behavior of

an individual UE is unspecified, and the performance (for example downlink throughput)

depends on the UE vendor. For more information on how to minimize the interference from

the downlink channels outside the wanted channel bandwidth, see Engineering Guidelines.

PCI planning can control PCFICH and PHICH mapping on PRBs inside the wanted channel

bandwidth.

The feature allows for LTE interference management. The operation of the feature is

aligned with frequency-selective scheduling algorithms to decrease interference.

Flexible Channel Bandwidth does not block control signals like SRS. Control signals can

still use the blocked PRBs.

Flexible Channel Bandwidth enables wideband SRS configuration with the following

features:

- Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

# 4 Network Impact of Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature impacts the network capacity and the reference signals.

Capacity and Performance

Throughput and capacity can be reduced since the feature reduces the spectrum used by

the channel. By enabling this feature and using 256-QAM, downlink throughput is

halved.

Positioning with Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDOA) can be negatively

affected since the Positioning Reference Signals are transmitted on the complete

bandwidth.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

| PDCCH  |    | On average, the fraction of REGs falling into blocked PRB range is                                 proportional with the fraction of blocked PRBs.    UE-specific and common search space together with a block interleaver                                 that distributes each PDCCH CCE in time and frequency makes it                                 difficult to avoid any REG from falling into the blocked PRB                                 range.     If PDCCH CCE falls into the blocked PRB range, it is more difficult                                 to decode. Therefore, PDCCH BLER and HARQ DTX are increased. |

EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion, and

EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion control the

number of blocked PRBs in downlink and uplink. It is recommended to block the same

number of PRBs in downlink and uplink. Table 1 and Table 2 show which values to choose

depending on the number of PRBs that are blocked and the configured channel

bandwidth of the carrier.

The parameters EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart and

EUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart, and

EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart and

EUtranCellTDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart control the number

of blocked PRBs that are on the low edge of the channel bandwidth. It is recommended

that the same number of PRBs are blocked on the low edge of the channel bandwidth in

both downlink and uplink. The number of blocked PRBs on the low edge of the channel

bandwidth must be equal or smaller than the total number of blocked PRBs controlled

by EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion, and

EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion.

The number of blocked PRBs that are not on the low edge of the channel bandwidth are

blocked PRBs on the high edge of the channel bandwidth. Table 3 and Table 4 show which values to choose

depending on the blocked PRBs that are on the low end of the channel bandwidth.

For downlink, the number of blocked PRBs can only be a multiple of the Resource Block

Group size. The Resource Block Group with the highest index has one fewer PRB for

the 5, 10, and 15 MHz channel bandwidths. The total number of blocked PRBs in Table 1 must match the available number of

blocked PRBs on the low edge (Table 3) and

on the high edge (Table 5). If these

numbers do not match, unexpected PRBs on the high edge can be blocked. For example,

four PRBs on the low edge and three PRBs on the high edge in downlink are blocked in

the 15 MHz carrier. In total 7 PRBs must be blocked and attributes

EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion must be set to

91.

For uplink, any number of blocking PRB configurations is available both on the low

and the high edge of the carrier.

The parameters EUtranCellFDD.pucchOverdimensioning and

EUtranCellTDD.pucchOverdimensioning move the PUCCH that are

on the edges of the channel bandwidth, away from the blocked PRBs. The parameter

specifies the number of PRBs on each edge of the channel bandwidth which is not used

for PUCCH. It is recommended that the value is equal or greater than both the number

of blocked PRBs on the low edge and the number of blocked PRBs on the high edge of

the channel bandwidth.

For example: Parameter settings in a cell with channel bandwidth 15 MHz where four

PRBs are blocked on the low edge and seven PRBs are blocked on the high edge. In

total, 11 PRBs are blocked that corresponds to value 86 for

EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion, and

EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion and

EUtranCellTDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion. Four PRBs are

blocked on the low edge that corresponds to value 6 for

EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart and

EUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart, and

EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart and

EUtranCellTDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart.

EUtranCellFDD.pucchOverdimensioning and

EUtranCellTDD.pucchOverdimensioning are set to seven or

higher, since seven PRBs are blocked on the high edge of the channel bandwidth.

# 6 Performance of Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature affects throughput-related KPIs.

KPIs

The feature affects downlink and uplink throughput on cell level. The feature can

also affect downlink and uplink UE throughput.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines

PDCCH and Reference Signals Outside the Wanted Channel Bandwidth

The PDCCH and Cell specific Reference Signals in blocked PRBs outside the wanted

channel bandwidth are transmitted and can interfere adjacent channels. The feature

Ericsson Lean Carrier can reduce the transmission of

Reference Signals. The feature Adjustable CRS power can reduce the power of the CRSs

and reduced the interference of adjacent channels. On muted PRBs, it is possible to

mute the following to reduce adjacent channel interferences:

- PDCCH
- PCFICH
- PCHICH
- CRS
- CSI-RS
- PRS

Avoid PCFICH and PHICH on PRBs Outside the Wanted Channel Bandwidth

Avoid

PCFICH and PHICH on PRBs that are blocked. By choosing PCI

value,

PCFICH and PHICH

mapping

can be disabled on blocked PRBs.

An

LTE resource grid tool

can

investigate which PCI values

can

be used in a specific configuration.

For a 5 MHz channel bandwidth with normal PHICH duration, two PHICH groups and PCI =

10, four PRBs low edge and one PRB on high edge can be blocked without blocking PRBs

with PCFICH and PHICH.

The more PRBs that are blocked the fewer of the 504 available PCI values can be used

without mapping a PCFICH or PHICH on blocked PRBs.

## 8.1 Enable Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature can be enabled by setting parameters to the necessary values.

Steps

1. Lock the EUtranCellFDD MO or EUtranCellTDD MO instance for the cell where the feature is activated.
2. Disable Interference Management by setting dlInterferenceManagementActive and ulInterferenceManagementActive to false.
3. Set dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and ulFrequencyAllocationProportion to a value corresponding to the total number of PRBs that are blocked on both edges of the channel.
4. Set dlConfigurableFrequencyStart and ulConfigurableFrequencyStart to values corresponding to the number of PRBs that are blocked on the low edges of the channel.
5. Set dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive to true to mute the following on blocked PRBs: PDCCH PCFICH PCHICH CRS CSI-RS PRS
6. Set dlCchAndRefSigBoost to true to use power boosting on remaining non-blocked PRBs. Note: If NB-IoT is deployed in LTE network, dlCchAndRefSigBoost can only be set to false.
7. Set pucchOverdimensioning to a value equal of higher than the number of blocked PRBs on both the high edge and low edge of the LTE carrier.
8. Unlock the MO instance chosen in Step 1.

Example 1

In this example, the following conditions are represented:

- Five PRBs are blocked in an FDD cell with channel bandwidth 10 MHz.
- Three PRBs are on the low edge, and two PRBs are on the high edge.
- Power Boost is active and the following are muted on blocked PRBs: PDCCH PCFICH PCHICH CRS CSI-RS PRS

Since the highest number of blocked PRBs on one side is three, the

pucchOverdimensioning parameter has to be set to three or

higher.

1. The EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState attribute is set to locked.
2. The EUtranCellFDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive attribute is set to false and the EUtranCellFDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive attribute is set to false.
3. The EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion attribute is set to 90 and the EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion attribute is set to 90.
4. The EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute is set to 7 and the EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute is set to 7.
5. The EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive attribute is set to true.
6. The EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost attribute is set to true.
7. The EUtranCellFDD.pucchOverdimensioningattribute is set to 3.
8. The EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState attribute is set to unlocked.

## 8.2 Disable Flexible Channel Bandwidth

Steps

1. Lock the EUtranCellFDD MO or EUtranCellTDD MO instance for the cell where the feature is disabled.
2. Set dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and ulFrequencyAllocationProportion to a 100.
3. Set dlConfigurableFrequencyStart and ulConfigurableFrequencyStart to 0.
4. Set dlCchAndRefSigBlockActiveto false in order to transmit the following (on blocked PRBs): PDCCH PCFICH PCHICH CRS CSI-RS PRS
5. Set dlCchAndRefSigBoost to false in order to switch off Power Boost for the remaining non-blocked PRBs, when the following are muted: PDCCH PCFICH PCHICH CRS CSI-RS PRS
6. Set pucchOverdimensioning to any supported value, the default is 0.
7. Unlock the MO instance that was locked in Step 1.

## 8.3 Configuration of Category M with Flexible Channel Bandwidth on 5 MHz

Category M can be configured to support the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature in

downlink on 5 MHz channel bandwidth.

To enable Category M support for the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature in downlink on 5

MHz channel bandwidth, the following attributes must be configured:

- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth attribute must be set to 5000.

- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth attribute must be set to 5000.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.catm1SupportEnabled attribute must be set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyEnabledBr attribute must be set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive attribute must be set to false.

In a Category M cell, the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart

and the EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion attributes must

be configured in a specific way to support the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature in

downlink on 5 MHz channel bandwidth.

Table 8   Supported Category M Configuration for Downlink Flexible Channel Bandwidth on

5 MHz

|   EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart |   EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|                                            0 |                                              88 |
|                                            0 |                                              96 |
|                                           10 |                                              92 |

If the attributes are not set correctly, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised,

with the following additional text:

dlConfigurableFrequencyStart=&lt;value&gt;

and dlFrequencyAllocationProportion=&lt;value&gt;

inconsistent with requirements of Category M Support for Downlink Flexible Channel

Bandwidth on 5 MHz.

Impacts on Capacity and Performance

Enabling Category M support for the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature in downlink on

5 MHz impacts the capacity and performance of the network.

Because of an introduced collision between the UE traffic and the system information

broadcasting, the cell throughput might decrease.

SIB1-BR acquisition delay might increase for Category M1 UE on the cell edge.

Reallocation of the narrowband with a specific configuration might affect

accessibility and cell throughput.

The following might slightly decrease:

- The coverage of SI-BR
- The coverage of Cat-M Paging

The following PM counter might increase:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPagReceived

The following PM counters might decrease:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlBr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlCatmMax
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlDtch
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlMpdcchPdschBr
- EutranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlMpdcchPuschBr

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

| Feature Name:           | Flexible Channel Bandwidth         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4756                       |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This feature enhancement reduces the interference in downlink on other overlapping RATs

by muting control channels and reference signals on blocked PRBs.

Capacity and Performance

Some noise is noticeable in the sub-bands where there are muted PRBs, as the feature

enhancement does not change the bandpass filter in the radio (for the original

bandwidth). Downlink throughput is reduced, and high-order modulation, especially

256-QAM is hard to achieve.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following parameters:

- EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive
- EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost
- EUtranCellTDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive
- EUtranCellTDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q2: Shared Carrier Interference Management with Frequency-Selective Scheduling

In FDD, interoperability between Flexible Channel Bandwidth and Frequency-Selective

Scheduling is enabled to support LTE interference management. Interoperability is supported

between the PDSCH and PUSCH PRB blocking functionality of Flexible Channel Bandwidth and

Frequency-Selective Scheduling in the downlink and the uplink.

| Feature Name:           | Flexible Channel Bandwidth   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4756                 |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                          |

Coping with Inter-RAT interference in LTE is included in the scope of this enhancement.

In addition, Flexible Channel Bandwidth does not block control signals like SRS. Control

signals can still use the blocked PRBs. However, interoperability is not supported

between the following deployments:

- The CRS Muting and Power Boosting functionality of Flexible Channel Bandwidth and Frequency Selective Scheduling
- Flexible Channel Bandwidth and Frequency Selective Scheduling in TDD

Benefits

In FDD, Flexible Channel Bandwidth is interoperable with the following features:

- Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The mutual interaction of the features allows for better interference

management within the LTE cell and on the cell edge.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement can improve uplink and downlink throughput.

Operation

Interoperability between Flexible Channel Bandwidth and frequency-selective

scheduling allows for the increased applicability of frequency-selective scheduling

algorithms. Wideband SRS is used in FDD cells when required.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

## Appendix A.c: 20.Q3: TDD Support for Shared Carrier Interference Management with Frequency-Selective Scheduling

In TDD, interoperability between Flexible Channel Bandwidth and Frequency-Selective

Scheduling is enabled to support LTE interference management.

- Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The mutual interaction of the features allows for better interference management

within the LTE cell and on the cell edge.

## Appendix A.d: 20.Q4: Sub-Band SRS for Uplink FSS-Based Interference Management

The

feature enhancement enables interference management through SRS allocation scheme

modification.

| Feature Name:           | Flexible Channel Bandwidth   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4756                 |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                          |

Benefits

The feature enhancement reduces interference from SRS transmissions in FSS configured

cells. It enables the scheduling of SRS transmissions on a smaller subset of

available PRBs based on FCB configuration. This can help in avoiding conflict with

adjacent RAN receivers or transmitters.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement can negate the impact of SRS on the measured UL interference

power on adjacent cells. This is only possible in a collocated deployment if one of

the cells uses a frequency spectrum provided by the Flexible Channel Bandwidth

feature.

Operation

Sub-band SRS allocations can be activated in the cell with the

EUtranCellFDD.subbandSrsActive and

EUtranCellTDD.subbandSrsActive parameters.

It is possible to configure the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature in a way that the

sub-band configuration aligns to wide-band configuration, then the algorithm selects

an SRS configuration that reflects the base operation of the feature without this

enhancement.

The configuration of this feature enhancement only supports a symmetric SRS channel

setup. However, the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature allows asymmetric

configurations. This can result in an SRS configuration that does not cover the full

PUSCH allocation region and overlaps the FCB-blocked area.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.4 is required for this feature enhancement.

## Appendix A.e: 22.Q4: CQI Compensation for Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature enhancement compensates for wideband and sub-band CQI and SINR

degradation when control channels and reference signals are muted.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement compensates for wideband and sub-band CQI and SINR

degradation when control channels and reference signals are muted, reducing the time

needed for link adaptation to adjust transmission parameters.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The average cell throughput is improved in the downlink.
- The UE throughput is improved in the downlink.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement is not covered by the 3GPP specification, so the performance

might depend on the UE.

The feature enhancement optimizes the link adaptation process. It increases the

downlink throughput but also increases the downlink HARQ BLER. The BLER is expected

to remain below 10%.

Operation

The feature enhancement is disabled by default. To enable it, control channel and

reference signal muting must be enabled first by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive or the

EUtranCellTDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive attribute to

true. The feature enhancement can then be enabled by setting

the EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary79 or the

EUranCellTDD.zzzTemporary79 attribute to

1.

The benefits to the cell and to the UE throughput can be increased by activating the

Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.

Summary and Benefits

This system enhancement adds Category M support for the downlink configuration of the

Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature to block PRBs on 5-Mhz channel bandwidth.

This system enhancement has the following benefits:

- The Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature can be used in downlink to block Category M PRBs.
- Category M can be deployed on a channel bandwidth that is less than 5 MHz.

Capacity and Performance

Because of an introduced collision between the UE traffic and the system information

broadcasting, the cell throughput might decrease.

SIB1-BR acquisition delay might increase for Category M1 UE on the cell edge.

Reallocation of the narrowband with a specific configuration might affect

accessibility and cell throughput.

The coverage of the following might slightly decrease:

- SI-BR
- Cat-M Paging

The following PM counter might increase:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPagReceived

The following PM counters might decrease:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlBr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlCatmMax
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlDtch
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlMpdcchPdschBr
- EutranCellFDD.pmPrbUsedDlMpdcchPuschBr

Operation

Two blocked PRBs are supported on the low edge of a channel. One or three blocked

PRBs are supported on the high edge of the channel.

The following attribute is introduced:

- EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyEnabledBr

To enable the system enhancement, the following attributes must be configured:

- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth attribute must be set to 5000.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth attribute must be set to 5000.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.catm1SupportEnabled attribute must be set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyEnabledBr attribute must be set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive attribute must be set to false.

The following new additional text for the Inconsistent

Configuration alarm is introduced:

- dlConfigurableFrequencyStart=&lt;value&gt; and dlFrequencyAllocationProportion=&lt;value&gt; inconsistent with requirements of Category M Support for Downlink Flexible Channel Bandwidth on 5 MHz.

When the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is

raised, the cell is disabled.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.05 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
