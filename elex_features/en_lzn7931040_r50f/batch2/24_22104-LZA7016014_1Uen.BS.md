# 1 Cascadable Radio Units Overview

The Cascadable Radio Units feature enables cascades of radio units for each CPRI

link.

Summary

The feature minimizes the need for fiber cables by reducing the total length and number of

fiber cables between the Baseband Unit and multiple external radios.

The feature increases the number of supported radios for each Baseband Unit as follows:

- Configurations enable six radios to connect to a single Baseband CPRI link (for Baseband units in LTE).
- The number of radio units connected to a single Baseband CPRI port can be further increased by adding one or two Baseband R503 units. This allows a single Baseband CPRI link to connect to up to 16 radio units by multiplexing each radio through a Baseband R503 unit. For details about Baseband R503 unit capacities, see Baseband Description.

Hardware

The following must be fulfilled for the feature to be operational:

- The radio units connected in the cascade chain must be configured. Radio Node Configurations provides information about supported radio units.
- The following additional limitations apply: Per standard Radio unit Baseband

Internal radios and external radios cannot be used in the same cascade chain. IRUs

can be cascaded with either external or internal radios. Each connection between the

units in a cascade chain must be of the same CPRI line rate or of lower rate than

the connection immediately previous in the cascade chain.

Limitations

The following limitation apply when cascading with Baseband R503:

- For LTE Baseband units, the maximum number of radio units per cascade chain is five.

Both symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations are supported.

For more details on cascading, and radio configurations with Baseband R503, see Radio Node Configurations.

Network Requirements

No Network Requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Cascadable Radio Units

Each radio unit has two CPRI ports, named DATA\_1 and DATA\_2. By using both of the

ports, it is possible to connect the radio units in a cascade. A total of 16 radio units can be

connected with a Baseband R503 splitter block in a cascade chain. In case of Baseband R,

Radio Gateway R608 units and the LC-05 9xCPRI line card,

there can be a maximum of five radios in a cascade chain.

RiPort Connections

An example of RiPort connection of a cascade configuration is shown in Figure 1. In this example, the cable (electrical for the

internal radio, and optical for the external radio) is connected to one of Baseband unit

RiPorts. The cable from the Baseband unit is connected to DATA\_1 of Internal Radio 1. The

DATA\_2 RiPort of Internal Radio 1 is connected to the DATA\_1 RiPort of Internal Radio 2.

Additional Baseband R503 units can also be connected to the Baseband Unit RiPorts, which

enables more radios to be connected to the Baseband Unit. While connecting radios to RiPort,

the direction of the ports must be 1 to 2 or 2 to 1 consistently within the whole cascade

chain. For additional limitations, see Radio Node Configurations. For the external radio, optical

connection can be used. If using the conversion function, for example conversion from eCPRI

to CPRI, the Radio Gateway R608 or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card can be used by connecting the

Baseband unit and Radio Gateway unit with an eCPRI link, and connecting the Radio unit and

Radio Gateway unit with a CPRI link. Between the Mixed Mode Baseband unit and the Radio

Gateway R608 unit, or the Baseband unit and the LC-05 9xCPRI line card, considering

capacity, a maximum of four eCPRI links are supported. The following units support both

electrical and optical cables:

- Baseband R503
- Radio Gateway R608
- LC-05 9xCPRI line card

R608

Figure 4   Example of RiPort Connections of a Cascade Configuration with LC-05 9xCPRI Line

Card

For Radio 6626 and Radio 4466, four CPRI ports can be used and are applicable to FDD only.

In the radio cascade configuration, DATA\_1 and DATA\_3 can only be used as cascade-in port,

while DATA\_2 and DATA\_4 can only be used as cascade-out port for connections to the next

cascaded radio. Both cascade chains on the same radio unit can be used only if they are

connected to different Baseband Radio Nodes.

Engineering Guidelines for Cascadable Radio Configurations

# 4 Network Impact of Cascadable Radio Units

This section describes how the Cascadable Radio Units feature impacts the network

functions and

capabilities.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases the number of supported radios for each Baseband Unit.

Due to the internal delay between the two RiPorts of a radio, the maximum fiber

distance of a cascaded configuration between the Baseband unit and the last radio in

the chain is less than what can be supported without cascading. The reduced fiber

distance is a function of the number of radios in the chain.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of Cascadable Radio Units

The implementation of this feature does not introduce any new parameters and affects no

parameters.

# 6 Performance of Cascadable Radio Units

This section describes performance indicators, counters, and events associated with

the Cascadable Radio Units feature.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Cascadable Radio Configurations

The following are examples of Cascadable Radio Unit configurations. Radio Node Configurations shows which radio types can be mixed in cascade chains.

- Six sectors, 2x2 MIMO for each sector, 2 radios for each chain, see Figure 6 Figure 6 Six Sectors, 2x2 MIMO, Two External Radios for Each Chain
- Six sectors, 2x2 MIMO for each sector, 2 radios for each chain, see Figure 7 Figure 7 Six Sectors, 2x2 MIMO, Two Internal Radios for Each Chain
- Three sectors, four-way Receive (RX) diversity, remote radios and RRUS A2 for each chain, see Figure 8 Figure 8 Three Sectors, Four-Way RX Diversity, External Radio and RRUS A2
- Three sectors, 2x2 MIMO for each sector, three external radios for each chain, see Figure 9 Figure 9 Three Sectors, 2x2 MIMO, Three External Radios for Each Chain

It is possible to

reverse

the order

of all radios in the

cascaded

chain.

This is useful

in a situation where there is a difference in CPRI line rate.

## 8.1 Configuration

Cascaded radio configurations are represented in the site equipment file.

Configuration Example of Three-Sector 2x2 MIMO with Three Cascaded External Radios on

Baseband units

Figure 10   Configuration Example of Three-Sector 2x2 MIMO with Three Cascaded External Radios on

Baseband units

This example configuration consists of the following:

- Three cascaded external radios
- Hardware connections and corresponding MO structure
- A basic three-sector 2x2 MIMO configuration that has three cascaded external radios with the Cascadable Radio Units feature

## 8.2 Cascaded Radio Units in Mixed Mode, FDD Only

One mixed mode radio at each end of the chain and multiple single-mode radios can be connected in a cascade chain. This configuration allows one standard to use different frequencies, and also to reduce equipment costs and simplify the antenna equipment setup.

For details and examples, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

Figure 11   Configuration Example of Cascading in Mixed Mode

Some AIR units can support different mixed mode configurations than standard internal or

external radios, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide

for details.

## 8.3 Supported Cascadable Radio Unit Configurations for Each Chain

Supported cascadable radio configurations are described in Radio Node Configurations.

Available bandwidth depends on CPRI used for other cascades. The total available bandwidth

depends on the CPRI bit rate, radio type, line rate, number and type of radio units, and other

RAN features. The bandwidth for each radio is further divided if the radio uses more than one

RF port (for example, 40 MHz means 2x20 MHz in case of two RF ports). See Radio Node Configurations for more information.

## 8.4 Effect of Link and Radio Failure

Multiple sectors can be affected by a link failure between two

radios. The example of a three-sector, six-chain radio configuration

with 2x2 MIMO for each sector is shown in Figure 12. The failure of the link between radio 1 and radio 2 affects all

three sectors. The first sector is in a degraded state, while sectors

2 and 3 are in a failed state.

Automatic radio restart and link recovery procedures are executed

to re-establish the connection between the radios. Depending on the

link or radio fault condition, the connection to all the affected

radios is re-established.

Radio

failures do not affect the other radios in the chain if the CPRI interface to the radios is

functional or until the radios are restarted. The effects of radio restarts are described in

Effect on Traffic at Radio Restart.

Figure 12   Effect of Link Failure

## 8.5 Effect on Traffic at Radio Restart

If multiple sectors are associated with radios in a cascade chain, restart of radios of a

particular sector can affect the traffic of other sectors.

Restart the sequence beginning with the radios that are closest

to the Baseband unit and continue in a chain to the outer radios.

The outer radios are dependent on the connections from the inner radios.
