# 1 LTE Offload to WCDMA Identity

| Value Package Identity   | FAJ 801 0421   |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Introduced in            | L16A           |

# 2 Benefits of LTE Offload to WCDMA

The LTE Offload to WCDMA value package allows the refarming of a WCDMA spectrum to an

LTE spectrum and the use of WCDMA capacity when refarming is not possible.

High-load situations in LTE cause users to be moved to WCDMA to secure a satisfactory

experience for the users that remain in LTE and for users that are moved to WCDMA.

The features included in the LTE Offload to WCDMA value package provide the following

benefits:

- Provides flexible network refarming by allowing operators to delay refarming until a network-wide refarming activity can be done
- Maintains an acceptable level of performance by moving users to WCDMA when the traffic load in the cell reaches a certain level.
- Provides functionality for automatic configuration and automatic cell capacity estimation.
- Improves spectrum efficiency.

Summary

The Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT

Offload

feature configures suitable cell relations for WCDMA IRAT offload

automatically and dynamically. Automatic configuration is simpler and more efficient

than manual configuration in network deployments with several frequency layers and

different cell grids. Dynamic configuration of load management relations improves

load management efficiency.

By considering suitable targets and removing unsuitable targets, the load-balancing relation

list is optimized and used to determine the amount of traffic load that is handed

over to each target cell. Additional unsuitable target cells in the list reduce the

chance of using suitable targets. In addition, they might increase the number of

unnecessary UE measurements.

Summary

This feature has the benefit of increasing UE performance through performing a

handover from overloaded LTE cells.

If an LTE cell is

overused,

the Inter-RAT Offload to

WCDMA

feature performs a handover of traffic load to a configured set

of WCDMA FDD cells with extra capacity. This feature allows for the cooperation of

LTE and WCDMA cells to optimize traffic load without the control of a central

node

The Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA feature is an add-on to the Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing feature, and uses this feature to assess traffic load. These features can

be used independently or simultaneously. Simultaneous use of these features has the

benefit of allowing for inter-frequency load balancing and inter-RAT offload

This feature has the following benefits:

- It reduces the risk that the UE performs poorly because of it being trapped in an overused LTE cell.
