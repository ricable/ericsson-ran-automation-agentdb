Summary

The Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature provides the

following benefits:

- It identifies the voice service by its QCI, or by its service type, and moves the UE to a frequency where the service is allowed.
- It improves the possibilities to fulfill the legal requirements on positioning precision for emergency calls. The feature optimizes the OTDOA positioning precision by either of the following: Moving emergency calls to the lowest possible frequency Moving emergency calls to the frequency with the tightest site grid

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature can affect other features which configure measurements in the UE and

trigger a handover to a reported cell. The following handovers are affected:

- Intra-frequency handovers
- Handovers to other LTE frequencies
- Handovers to other RATs

To avoid voice service delays caused by handovers, these handovers are disabled when

all the following conditions are true:

- Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover measurements are configured in the UE
- EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo or EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo attribute is set to QCI
- EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer or EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer attribute is set to false

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

Engineering Guidelines for Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

# 3 Feature Operation of Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

The feature can be configured by attributes to act on bearers with QCI=1 service level

or bearers with a specific priority.

The effect of the Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature is

controlled by the EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo, and the

EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo attributes.

The following values are possible:

- If the value is set to NOT\_ACTIVATED, the feature is not activated in this cell.
- If the value is set to ARP, the behavior is always to set up bearers before handover.
- If the value is set to QCI, the feature can be configured to use one of two behaviors depending on the value of the EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer, or EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer attribute: If the value is set to true, the behavior is to set up bearers before handover. If the value is set to false, the behavior is to handover before setting up bearers.

Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover with Handover before Bearer Setup

## 3.1 Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover with Bearer Setup before Handover

The feature is configurable to set up bearers before handover.

The feature can be triggered by the following procedures:

- E-RAB setup request from the MME
- Incoming handover
- RRC connection re-establishment
- Initial context setup

Operational Process

Figure 1   E-RAB Setup Request Handling, Bearer Setup before Handover

1. A set of bearers is set up for a UE. This occurs as part of the following procedures: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST A message from the MME which requests the eNodeB to set up a set of bearers for the UE. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.413, and Multiple Radio Bearers per User. Incoming Handover During incoming handover preparation, resources for a set of bearers are allocated in the eNodeB. During handover execution, the bearers are configured in the UE. RRC Connection Re-establishment When a UE initiates an RRC re-establishment, the bearers of the UE are set up in the UE again. Initial Context Setup At Initial Context Setup, a set of bearers is set up for the UE.
2. If this feature, or the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature is inoperable, the bearers are set up without being affected by this feature.
3. The bearer setup request is considered to fulfill the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) if the following conditions are met:
    - The EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo or the EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo MO attribute has the value ARP [1]
    - The set of bearers contains at least one bearer with an ARP level that corresponds to a TRUE value in the EUtranCellFDD.arpPriorityLevelForSPIFHo or the EUtranCellTDD.arpPriorityLevelForSPIFHo MOM attribute.
4. The eNodeB can be configured so that the UE is only repositioned if there is an improvement of OTDOA. For more information, see OTDOA User Plane Location Support, and Inter-Frequency OTDOA. If the following criteria are fulfilled, the UE can stay in the current cell and the bearers can be set up without being affected by the Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature: The EUtranCellFDD.otdoaCheckEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.otdoaCheckEnabled attribute is set to true, and at least one of the following criteria is true:
    - The UE does not support OTDOA. That is, the UE capability IE otdoa-UE-Assisted-r10 is not present.
    - The UE supports OTDOA, and there is a PRS signal in the source cell. That is, the otdoa-UE-Assisted-r10 UE capability IE is set to supported, and the OTDOA User Plane Location Support feature is operable. Also, the EUtranCellFDD.otdoaSuplActive or the EUtranCellTDD.otdoaSuplActive attribute is set to true for the cell.
    - The UE and the eNodeB support Inter-Frequency OTDOA measurements. That is, the interFreqRSTD-Measurement-r10 UE capability IE is set to supported, and the Inter-Frequency OTDOA feature is operable.
5. The eNodeB determines the set of frequency candidates where the UE looks for possible handover target cells when the ARP of the bearer triggers this feature. This is done by including each EUtranFreqRelation that fulfills all the following criteria: According to the capabilities of the UE, as reported to the eNodeB in the information element UE-EUTRA-Capability, the UE is able to operate on this frequency. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, more frequencies can be supported by the UE. The EUtranFreqRelation.arpPrio attribute of the frequency states can be measured. A priority value of -1 means that the frequency is not measured. The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute has the value HANDOVER. If the frequency has a different mode (for example TDD for FDD), then the feature Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover must be operable. If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used. If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used. From this set of frequency candidates, the eNodeB selects the frequency relations with the highest value for arpPrio.Note: If several frequency relations share the highest value for this attribute, then they are all selected.
6. The bearer setup request is considered to fulfill the QCI criteria if: If the request does not fulfill the QCI criteria, the bearers are set up without being affected by this feature.
    - The EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo or the EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo MO attribute has the value QCI [0].
    - The set of bearers contains at least one bearer with a QCI value equal to 1.
7. The eNodeB determines the set of frequency candidates where the UE looks for possible handover target cells when the QCI of the bearer triggers this feature. This is done by including each EUtranFreqRelation that fulfills the following criteria: According to the capabilities of the UE, as reported to the eNodeB in the information element UE-EUTRA-Capability, the UE is able to operate on this frequency. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, more frequencies can be supported by the UE. The EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute of the frequency states can be measured. A priority value of -1 means that the frequency is not measured. The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER. If the target frequency has a different mode (for example TDD for FDD), the feature Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover must be operable. If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used. If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used. From this set of frequency candidates, the eNodeB selects the frequency relations with the highest value for EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio. If several frequency relations share the highest value for this attribute, then they are all selected.
8. The feature is triggered by a bearer with QCI 1. Also, there are no frequency candidates where the UE can find a suitable target cell for handover. In this case, the behavior of the eNodeB differs depending on the value of the following MOM parameters: EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioTriggeredErabAction or EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioTriggeredErabAction If the value is SETUP all the bearers in the request are set up in the regular way. If the value is REJECT the behavior depends on what triggered the bearer setup: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause Not allowed QCI value. Any other bearer in the request is set up and included in the E-RAB Setup List. The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message is sent to the MME.Note: The E-RAB Failed to Setup List and the E-RAB Setup List IEs are included in the S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message. Initial Context Setup All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause Not allowed QCI value. Any other bearer in the request is set up and included in the E-RAB Setup List. The S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message is sent to the MME.Note: The E-RAB Failed to Setup List and the E-RAB Setup List IEs are included in the S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message. Incoming Handover Preparation All bearers in the request are rejected by the feature. As a result, the X2:HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE or the S1AP:HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE response message is sent to the MME or Source eNodeB. RRC Connection Re-establishment All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected. This causes the re-establishment to fail and a RRCConnectionReestablishmentReject message is sent to the UE.
9. There are frequency candidates which the UE can search for handover target cells, but it is not possible to configure any new measurements in the UE. In this case, the behavior depends on the value of the following MOM attributes: EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled If the attribute is set to FALSE, all the bearers in the request are set up in the regular way. If the attribute is set to TRUE, the behavior depends on what triggered the bearer setup: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE response message is sent to the MME, with all bearers from the request included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List. In E-RAB Failed to Setup List where the bearers with QCI=1 (see step 5) have the cause value Not allowed QCI value, and all other bearers in the request have an unspecified cause. This includes all bearers with a specific ARP level, see step 3. Then, the UE is released with a redirect to one of the frequencies selected in step 5 or step 7, using the release cause value Release due to E-UTRAN Generated Reason. Initial Context Setup The S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP FAILURE response message is sent to the MME. The UE is released with a redirect to one of the frequencies selected in step 5 or step 7, using the release cause value Release due to E-UTRAN Generated Reason. Incoming Handover Preparation Setup of the bearers fails. This causes the handover preparation to fail. RRC Connection Re-establishment Setup of the bearers fails, and as a consequence, the eNodeB rejects the re-establishment.
10. The bearers included in the request are configured, both in the eNodeB and in the UE. A5 measurements are configured to find a suitable handover target cell. The behavior at Incoming Handover is slightly different. The UeMeasControl.servOrPrioIFHoTimer timer is started. Depending on what started the bearer setup procedure, the following happens: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE response message is sent. Initial Context Setup No action is taken. Incoming Handover Preparation The bearers included in the request are prepared in the eNodeB. The UE is configured with the bearers when it connects to the eNodeB during handover execution. This also applies when the A5 measurements are configured in the UE. RRC Connection Re-establishment No action is taken.

## 3.2 Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover with Handover before Bearer Setup

The feature is configurable for handover before bearer setup.

The feature can be triggered by the following procedures:

- E-RAB setup request from the MME
- Incoming handover
- RRC connection re-establishment
- Initial context setup

Operational Process

Figure 2   E-RAB Setup Request Handling, Handover before Bearer Setup

1. A set of bearers is set up for a UE. This occurs as part of the following procedures: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST A message from the MME which requests the eNodeB to set up a set of bearers for the UE, see 3GPP TS 36.413, and Multiple Radio Bearers per User. Incoming Handover During incoming handover preparation, resources for a set of bearers are allocated in the eNodeB. During handover execution, the bearers are configured in the UE. RRC Connection Re-establishment When a UE initiates an RRC re-establishment, the bearers of the UE are set up in the UE again. Initial Context Setup At Initial Context Setup, a set of bearers is set up for the UE.
2. The bearer setup request is considered to fulfill the QCI criteria if the set of bearers contains at least one bearer with QCI=1. Note: If the request does not fulfill the QCI criteria, the bearers are set up without being affected by this feature.
3. All bearers in setup request can be rejected depending on what triggered the bearer setup: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST No bearers are rejected. Incoming Handover Preparation All bearers in the request are rejected by the feature. As a result, the X2:HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE or the S1AP:HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE response message is sent to the MME or the Source eNodeB. RRC Connection Re-establishment All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected. As a result, the re-establishment fails and the RRCConnectionReestablishmentReject message is sent to the UE. Initial Context Setup No bearers are rejected.
4. The eNodeB determines the set of frequency candidates where the UE looks for possible handover target cells. This is done by including each EUtranFreqRelation that fulfills the following criteria: From this set of frequency candidates, the eNodeB selects the frequency relations with the highest value for EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio. Note: If several frequency relations share the highest value for this attribute, they are all selected.
    - According to the capabilities of the UE, as reported to the eNodeB in the information element UE-EUTRA-Capability, the UE is able to operate on this frequency. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, more frequencies can be supported by the UE.
    - The EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute of the frequency states if it can be measured. A priority value of -1 means that the frequency is not measured.
    - The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER.
    - If the target frequency has a different mode (TDD or FDD), the feature Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover must be operable.
    - If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
    - If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
    1. If there are no frequency candidates where the UE can find a suitable target cell for handover. In this case, the behavior depends on what triggered the bearer setup: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause Not allowed QCI value. Any other bearer in the request is set up and included in the E-RAB Setup List. The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message is sent to the MME.Note: The E-RAB Failed to Setup List and the E-RAB Setup List IEs are included in the S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message. Incoming Handover Preparation Handover already rejected, see step 3. RRC Connection Re-establishment Re-establishment already rejected, see step 3. Initial Context Setup All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause Not allowed QCI value. Any other bearer in the request is set up and included in the E-RAB Setup List. The S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message is sent to the MME.Note: The E-RAB Failed to Setup List and the E-RAB Setup List IEs are included in the S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.
5. If there are frequency candidates which the UE can use to search for handover target cells, but it is not possible to configure any new measurements in the UE, the behavior depends on the value of the MOM attributes: EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled
    1. If EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled or EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled is false, the behavior depends on what triggered the bearer setup: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST All bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause Not allowed QCI value. Any other bearer in the request is set up and included in the E-RAB Setup List. The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message is sent to the MME.Note: The E-RAB Failed to Setup List and the E-RAB Setup List IEs are included in the S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message. Incoming Handover Preparation Handover already rejected, see step 3. RRC Connection Re-establishment Re-establishment already rejected, see step 3. Initial Context Setup E-RAB Failed to Setup ListAll bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the with the cause Not allowed QCI value. Any other bearer in the request is set up and included in the E-RAB Setup List. The S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message is sent to the MME.Note: The E-RAB Failed to Setup List and the E-RAB Setup List IEs are included in the S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.
    2. If EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled or EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled is true, the behavior depends on what triggered the bearer setup: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST In the eNodeB, all bearers from the request included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with QCI=1 (see step 2) have the cause value Not allowed QCI value, and all other bearers in the request have an unspecified cause. The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE response message is sent to the MME. The UE is released with a redirect to one of the frequencies selected in step 5 or step 4, using the release cause value Release due to E-UTRAN Generated Reason. Incoming Handover Preparation Handover already rejected, See step 3. RRC Connection Re-establishment Re-establishment already rejected, See step 3. Initial Context Setup The S1AP:INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP FAILURE response message is sent to the MME. The UE is released with a redirect to one of the frequencies selected in step 5 or step 4, using the release cause value Release due to E-UTRAN Generated Reason.
6. The bearers included in the request which have QCI=1 can be rejected depending on what started the bearer setup procedure: E-RAB SETUP REQUEST In the eNodeB, all bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause S1 intra system handover triggered. Any other bearer in the request is set up. The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE response message is sent to the MME. Incoming Handover Preparation Handover is already rejected. See Step 3. RRC Connection Re-establishment Re-establishment already rejected. See Step 3. Initial Context Setup If EUtranCellTDD.spifhoSetupBearerAtInitialCtxtSetup or EUtranCellFDD.spifhoSetupBearerAtInitialCtxtSetup is true, then all bearers in the request are set up. If EUtranCellTDD.spifhoSetupBearerAtInitialCtxtSetup or EUtranCellFDD.spifhoSetupBearerAtInitialCtxtSetup is false, then all bearers with QCI=1 from the request are rejected in the eNodeB and included in the E-RAB Failed to Setup List with the cause Not allowed QCI value. All other bearers in the request are set up. The S1AP:E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE response message is sent to the MME. The remaining bearers included in the request are configured, both in the eNodeB and in the UE. Also, A5 measurements are configured to find a suitable handover target cell, see A5 Measurements. Also, the timer UeMeasControl.servOrPrioIFHoTimer is started.

A5 Measurements

## 3.3 A5 Measurements

To find a target cell for handover, the eNodeB sets up A5 measurements in the

UE.

The configuration of the A5 measurements is based on the attributes in the

ReportConfigA5 or the ReportConfigA5SpifhoMO.

TheReportConfigA5 MO is also used when the eNodeB configures the A5

measurements for the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity and the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage features.

The EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig or the

EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig MO can be used to enable A5

measurement configuration for the Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

feature.

If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig or the

EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig attribute is set to

false, the following MO attributes are used for this feature:

- ReportConfigA5.a5Threshold2Rsrp
- ReportConfigA5.hysteresisA5
- ReportConfigA5.timeToTriggerA5

In this case, the trigger quantity is always the RSRP. Threshold1 is

hard-coded to -44 dBm to ensure that Entering condition 1 is always

fulfilled for A5 measurement. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331.

If the Service Triggered Mobility feature is operable, the value of the

a5Threshold2RsrpOffset member of the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.measReportConfigParams and the

QciProfilePredefined.measReportConfigParams attributes can be used. If

the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility feature is operable, the value of the

EUtranFreqRelation.a5Thr2RsrpFreqOffset attribute can be used.

If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig or the

EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig attribute is set to

true, the feature-specific A5 measurements can be configured with the

ReportConfigA5Spifho MO.  In this case, the following additional options

are available:

- RSRQ can be set as a trigger quantity.
- Threshold1 is configurable with the ReportConfigA5Spifho.a5Threshold1Rsrp and the ReportConfigA5Spifho.a5Threshold1Rsrq attributes.

Both RSRP and RSRQ can be checked for the Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency

Handover feature-specific A5 measurements regardless of the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig or the

EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig attribute. If the

UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheckSpifho attribute is set to true,

handover occurs only if conditions are met both for the RSRP\_target and the RSRQ\_target.

### 3.3.1 Handling of A5 Measurement Reports

A5 Measurement reports are used to determine if handover is possible for the

UE.

The handling of A5 measurement reports is illustrated in Figure 3.

Operational Process

Figure 3   Operational Sequence Diagram

An E-RAB has been set up in the UE, which requires the UE to be handed over to

another cell. A5 measurements have been configured in the UE to search for

such a cell. The timer, UeMeasControl.servOrPrioIFHoTimer, has

been started to handle the case when a cell is reported by the UE.

1. The eNodeB waits for a measurement report from the A5 measurements configured in 6.
2. An A5 measurement report arrives from the UE.
3. If the measurement report includes a valid handover target cell, a handover is initiated. A cell is valid for handover when all the following criteria are fulfilled: The reported cell is known in the source cell. That is, a EUtranCellRelation exists to the reported cell from the cell where the UE is connected. Handover is allowed to the cell according to the MOM attribute EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed. The UE FGI bit 13, Inter-Frequency Handover within FDD or TDD, is set to 1. If the frequency band of the target cell has a different mode (for example TDD for FDD), the UE FGI bit 30, Handover between FDD and TDD, is set to 1.
4. When the eNodeB determines that no handover can be initiated based on the reported cells, the behavior depends on the value of the MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled: If the value is true, the eNodeB releases the UE with a redirection to the frequency of the reported cell using the cause value User Inactivity. If the value is false, the eNodeB does nothing and waits for another measurement report.
5. The timer UeMeasControl.servOrPrioIFHoTimer expires. The behavior depends on the value of the MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioRedirectEnabled. If the value is true, the eNodeB releases the UE with a redirection to the frequency with the highest priority. The release cause value Release due to E\_UTRAN Generated Reason is used, based on the same priority attribute used when selecting the measured frequencies. If the value is false, the eNodeB removes the configured A5 measurements from the UE and keeps it in the current cell. Note: If UeMeasControl.servOrPrioIFHoTimer has the value 0, the timer never expires.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

The Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature can cause delays

in the setup of voice service during UE handovers.

The following procedures can cause delays in the voice service:

- Intra-frequency handover
- Handover to other LTE frequencies
- Handover to other RATs

To avoid service delays, the handovers during these cases are disabled when the all the

following conditions are met:

- Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover measurements are configured in the UE.
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo or the EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo attribute is set to QCI
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer or the EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer attribute is set to false

Feature-Specific A5 Measurement Configuration

An A5 measurement configuration that is specific to the Service or

Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature can be activated with the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig
- EUtranCellTDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig

When a handover action that is triggered by the Service or Priority-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Handover feature is evaluated, an A5 measurement report is sent.

The value of the UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheckSpifho attribute

controls whether both RSRP and RSRQ are checked during handover evaluation.

# 10 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 10.1 21.Q3: Differentiated VoLTE Mobility

This feature enhancement introduces specific event A5 configurations for the Service

or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature.

| Feature Name:           | Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3087                                             |
| Value Package Name:     | Service-Based Mobility                                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0433                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |

With the feature enhancement, an event A5 measurement configuration that is specific to

the Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature can be activated. To

activate this configuration, the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig or the

EUtranCellTDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig attribute must be set

to true.

The feature enhancement introduces a configurable solution for checking both RSRP and

RSRQ in the event A5 measurement report for the Service or Priority-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Handover feature. If the

UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheckSpifho attribute is set to

true, handover occurs if the target conditions are met both for

RSRP and RSRQ.

Benefits

With the introduction of dedicated attributes, the Service or Priority-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Handover feature can be configured independently from other mobility

features that use event A5 measurements.

The dedicated event A5 configuration brings the following benefits:

- The feature can be configured independently from other mobility features that use event A5 measurements.
- VoLTE mobility is enabled when the feature is configured to handover before bearer setup when no voice bearer is set up. Note: The feature is configured to handover before bearer setup when the EUtranCellFDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer or the EUtranCellTDD.servOrPrioIFHoSetupBearer attribute is set to false.
- The timetotrigger attribute can be configured independently. When the attribute is set to 0, a VoLTE attempt can be redirected to FDD immediately. This can improve VoLTE setup time.
- Threshold1 and the triggering quantity are configurable.

Capacity and Performance

With the feature-specific event A5 measurement configuration, the frequency with

which the UE performs the mobility actions that are triggered by the Service or

Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature can increase or decrease.

This feature enhancement can affect the following KPIs:

- Mobility KPIs
- Accessibility KPIs
- Retainability KPIs

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the ReportConfigA5Spifho MO

class.

The following attributes are introduced:

- ReportConfigA5Spifho.a5Threshold1Rsrp
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.a5Threshold1Rsrq
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.a5Threshold2Rsrp
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.a5Threshold2Rsrq
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.hysteresisA5
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.reportConfigA5SpifhoId
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.timeToTriggerA5
- ReportConfigA5Spifho.triggerQuantityA5
- EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig
- EUtranCellTDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig
- UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheckSpifho

The QCI offsets do not apply for the dedicated configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
