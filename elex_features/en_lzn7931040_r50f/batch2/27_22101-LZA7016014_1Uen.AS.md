# 2 Benefits of Location Support

The ability to locate users offers operators several potential benefits:

- Boosts the location awareness of subscribers and devices.
- Opens up new revenue streams.
- Improves brand perception.
- Leads to the optimal customer experience.
- Enables the profiling of different target groups.

Device and

Subscriber

Location

Awareness

Location awareness is in the DNA of mobile networks. If the mobile network cannot

retrieve information about the location of two different devices, a connection

cannot be established.

By using the passive signaling in the networks and the information that subscribers

transmit when they use their devices, operators can determine the location of people

and devices alike.

Mobile operators already possess this

knowledge,

but seldom

benefit

from its full potential or use it

for

the

benefit

of

both themselves and

the

customers.

Ericsson LBS provides

a

powerful vehicle to make the best use of the

information

presented

in the network.

New

Revenue

Streams

Operators all around the world are facing the same challenges with the decline in

average revenue per user. Many are also in a position where they risk becoming

solely providers of IP connectivity.

For that reason, operators need to find ways of using mobile networks to offer new,

attractive services. By developing their offerings, they can enhance the perception

of their networks as "smart pipes." Using location as a basis for new services is a

promising way forward.

One such service is location-based advertising. Mobile networks can detect the

location of a user that enables the advertisers to send commercial messages to a

specific audience. For example, geofencing can be used. This means that a predefined

area is created around a shopping mall, and when a customer enters the area, they

receive offers from local stores.

Mobility analytics builds on the fact that all connected devices generate large

amounts of data. By using mobility analytics, operators can gather information that

can be used by advertisers. Advertisers then can direct messages to specific

segments and thereby become more relevant to their customers.

Improved

Brand

Perception

Operators can considerably improve their brand perception. Some current regulations

require that operators must be able to position emergency calls - and Ericsson LBS

follows strict governmental directives in this area.

Community information warning systems are another example of location-based

applications that enable operators to contribute to the good of society. These

services use location information to send out warnings, for instance, about fires,

tornadoes, or tsunamis.

Governments and other authorities are also becoming increasingly interested in

services that can help optimize road traffic and track vulnerable

people.

Public Safety and Regulatory Compliance

Location-based information can be used to locate emergency calls.

Regulatory

requirements

are in place

today

that make it mandatory for operators to be able to position these types of

calls.

EU Directive E112 (2003) requires mobile phone networks to provide emergency services

with whatever information they have about the location from where a mobile call is

initiated. This directive is based on the Enhanced 911 ruling of US FCC, made in

2001.

Apart from locating people calling emergency numbers, location-based services can

also be used to inform or warn people if something significant is about to happen.

This includes natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, or tsunamis. In

Australia, for instance, this type of application is widely used to warn the users

about bush fires.

# 3 Location Support Business Values

Revenue Growth: New

Services

An operator can offer location information for any device in the coverage area of the

network. This means that advertisers doing business with an operator can interact

with any user, not only those who have downloaded a particular app or have a

specific kind of

device, which

results in a bigger potential

audience.

# 4 Included Functions

the control protocol or the user-plane protocol as underlying transport.

LPPa is introduced in 3GPP Release 9 as a supplement to the main LPP.

The feature enables direct data collection from eNodeBs for support of downlink OTDOA

positioning.

## 4.8 OTDOA Control Plane Location Support Overview

The OTDOA Control Plane Location Support feature allows for the configuration of the

Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). The feature also enables the eNodeB to provide precise

cell frame timing to the OSS.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                      |

| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license per radio. |

Summary

The OTDOA Control Plane Location Support feature enables the operator to configure the PRS.

The PRS serves as the basis for the OTDOA method defined in 3GPP.

A sequence of subframes (one, two, four, or six) transmitting the PRS is referred to

as a PRS occasion. No other data is scheduled in the positioning reference signal

subframe apart from the PRS. In this way, the interference in the sequence of

subframes can be minimized. The subframes are referred to as LISs.

The operator determines the following parameters of the feature:

- The periodicity of the radio frames containing the PRS
- The number of subframes transmitting the PRS at every transmit occasion

The UE measures PRSs from multiple eNodeBs along with the following data:

- Geographical information of the eNodeBs
- The relative downlink timing of eNodeBs

The estimate of the UE position can be established on such basis.

The positioning node is in the control plane architecture called E-SMLC. The OTDOA method

requires the positioning node to know the exact cell frame timing. The positioning

node can retrieve cell frame timing information from the OSS. The feature enables

the eNodeB to provide the OSS precise cell frame timing.

The OTDOA method allows for the following functions:

- Sufficient positioning accuracy (50-200 m) to serve as fallback to the A-GPS method
- Compliance with the FCC phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning of emergency calls

These functions also provide information on the location of the customer. Standalone, the

OTDOA method can serve to position a wide variety of commercial services based on UE

location.

## 4.9 OTDOA PRS Management Overview

This feature improves the accuracy of the positioning-related measurements of a

UE.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |

| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature mutes PRS signals at times when there is a possibility of interfering with a

neighboring cell.

Without PRS management, neighboring cells can transmit their PRS at the same time and

cause interference. PRS management enables different cells to transmit at different

times by muting some of the cells at certain times.

PRS signals are sent from all cell antennas at the same time. The different arrival times are

used for positioning.

Figure 2   PRS Signals Sent to UE from Different Antennas

The feature offers the following benefits:

- Less interference between neighboring cells during PRS transmissions, which results in more accurate PRS measurements. Therefore, more accurate coordinates of the location of the UEs are obtained.
- A higher capacity when compared with OTDOA solutions without PRS muting.

## 4.10 OTDOA User Plane Location Support Overview

The feature enables the operator to configure the OTDOA positioning method, that

provides an estimate of the UE

position.

Summary

The OTDOA User Plane Location Support feature enables the operator to configure the

Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) that forms the basis for the OTDOA method defined

in 3GPP (introduced in 3GPP release 9). The operator determines the periodicity of

the radio frames containing PRS and the number of subframes transmitting PRS for

each transmit occasion. A sequence of subframes (1, 2, 4, or 6) transmitting PRS is

referred to as a "PRS occasion". To minimize the interference in the PRS subframe,

no other data is scheduled in those subframes. These subframes are therefore

referred to as LISs.

The UE measures PRSs from multiple eNodeBs along with geographical information of the

eNodeB positions and their relative downlink timing, an estimate of the UE position

can be established.

The feature also enables the eNodeB to provide precise cell frame timing to the

OSS, from where the positioning node can retrieve

this information. The positioning node is in the user plane architecture called SLP.

Knowledge of cell timing by the positioning node is a prerequisite for the OTDOA

method.

FDD only: In the LISs, where the PRSs are transmitted, no user data is scheduled. This means

that some of the downlink cell capacity is lost. Capacity loss depends on the

periodicity of the PRS frames and the number of subframes in each PRS occasion. In

the worst case, with a periodicity of 160 ms and six consecutive subframes, the

downlink capacity loss is 3.75%. A more typical scenario with a periodicity of 1,280

ms and four consecutive subframes gives a loss of only 0.31%.

TDD only: In the LISs, where the PRSs are transmitted, no user data is scheduled. This means

that some of the downlink cell capacity is lost. Capacity loss depends on the

periodicity of the PRS frames, the number of subframes in each PRS occasion and the

number of downlink subframes per radio frame. In the worst case, with a periodicity

of 160 ms and all downlink subframes used for PRS, the downlink capacity loss is

6.25%. A more typical scenario with a periodicity of 1280 ms and four out of six

downlink subframes used for PRS gives a loss of only 0.52%.

The OTDOA method provides sufficient positioning accuracy (50-200 m) to serve as a

fallback method for the A-GPS method and enables the operator to comply with the FCC

phase 2 accuracy requirements on positioning of emergency calls.

Standalone, it can serve as the positioning method for a wide variety of commercial

services based on UE location.
