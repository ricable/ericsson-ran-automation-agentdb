# 1 Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover Overview

The

Coverage-Triggered-Inter-Frequency Handover feature enhances active mode mobility between

frequencies and cells in an LTE network. The feature enables handover between cells on

different frequencies in the LTE network while maintaining the data

session.

Summary

The feature extends the function of the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session

Continuity feature by introducing the option of initiating a handover to a cell on a

different LTE frequency instead of initiating a release with redirect in case of poor

coverage in the serving cell.

Correct configuration of the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature is

required to ensure the

following

feature behavior:

- The UE is transferred to a cell on a different frequency for which the UE has coverage.
- If several candidate target cells are available that do not cover the source cell completely, an A5 measurement is configured in the UE.
- If at least one target cell is available that covers the source cell completely, the UE hands over directly without an A5 measurement measurement.

The

feature offers the following benefits over the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency

Session Continuity feature:

- Reduced interruptions of data flows during the session transition process.
- Enhanced control over the transfer of UEs between frequencies and cells.
- Using handover to transfer a UE between cells enables the eNodeB to use different admission criteria than for RRC connection setup. This improves the probability that a service, for example VoIP, is not interrupted in a network with high load.

If the Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover feature is activated, the

source and target cells in the inter-frequency handover can be of different types,

that is, source of type TDD or FDD and target of type FDD or TDD, respectively.

specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No

known

limitations.

Network Requirements

There must be a UE in the network that is able to perform inter-frequency handover.

This is indicated in bit 13 of the featureGroupIndicators

parameter which is part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability IE described in 3GPP TS

36.331.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

If a UE is in poor coverage in the current frequency, blind or measurement-based

inter-frequency handover is performed to a frequency that the UE has capabilities

for.

The feature extends the function of the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session

Continuity feature by introducing the option of initiating a handover to a cell on a

different LTE frequency instead of initiating a release with redirect in case of poor

coverage in the serving cell.

Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature, optionally combined with

the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature, uses the A2 measurement process to detect

poor coverage in the serving cell. The eNodeB determines the set of frequencies, LTE or

other RAT, that are target candidates for transferring the UE, and if the frequency with the

highest priority that the UE has capabilities for is an LTE frequency.

The eNodeB can perform one of the following transfer procedures:

| Blind Release with Redirect             |    | If the eNodeB determines that the UE is in poor coverage, it can release the UE                 with a redirection indication to the target frequency.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Measurement-based Release with Redirect |    | The UE initiates an A5 measurement or A3 measurement to determine whether a cell                 that covers the UE exists on the target frequency. In this case, the eNodeB waits                 until the UE sends the measurement report. Then, a release with redirection                 indication for the target frequency is initiated. |

Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

feature provides the

option for inter-frequency handover instead of release with

redirect.

The following procedures are introduced:

| Blind Inter-Frequency Handover             |    | The target cell of the handover is chosen based on                             preconfigured information, and not based on measurements performed by                             the UE.  If the eNodeB determines that the UE is in poor coverage, it can initiate a handover for the UE to                 a predefined cell on the target frequency that covers the source cell                 completely.                                                            |

| Measurement-based Inter-Frequency Handover |    | The target cell of the handover is chosen                             based on a target measurement report received from the UE.  In this case, the UE initiates an A5 measurement or A3 measurement to determine                 whether a cell that covers the UE exists on the target frequency. The eNodeB waits                 until the UE sends the measurement report. Then, a handover is initiated to one of                 the cells received in the report. |

Process Steps

1. Inter-frequency handover is triggered. For more information, see Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity and Mobility Control at Poor Coverage.
2. The eNodeB selects a target cell for transferring the UE.
3. The eNodeB initiates the handover. For more information on the handover procedure, see Intra-LTE Handover. During handover, the source and the target eNodeB can communicate through an X2 link. If an X2 link is not available, the eNodeBs communicate over the MME through S1 links. The events sent from the eNodeB during handover contain the following information: Whether the handover is an inter-frequency handover. Whether the handover is a blind or measurement-based handover.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

The eNodeB needs to be configured to allow blind or measurement-based inter-frequency

handovers to a target LTE frequency.

## 9.1 Blind Inter-Frequency Handover Configuration

The eNodeB needs to be configured to allow blind inter-frequency handovers to the

target LTE frequency.

To indicate that blind inter-frequency handover can be used for the target frequency, the

eNodeB needs to be configured in the following way:

- The EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute must be set to TRUE in the serving cell.
- The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute must be set to HANDOVER in the EUtranFreqRelation MO that represents the target frequency under the source cell MO.
- An EUtranCellRelation MO must exist under the target EUtranFreqRelation MO.
- The cell indicated by the EUtranCellRelation MO must cover the serving cell completely. This way, a handover without measurements can be performed. This is achieved by setting the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator to COVERS.
- The EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute must be set to true.

## 9.2 Measurement-Based Inter-Frequency Handover Configuration

The eNodeB needs to be configured to allow measurement-based inter-frequency handovers

to a target LTE frequency.

To indicate that measurement-based inter-frequency handover can be used for a target

frequency, the eNodeB needs to be configured in the following way:

- If the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is active, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF attribute must be set to true. Otherwise, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute must be set to true.
- The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute must be set to HANDOVER in the EUtranFreqRelation MO that represents the target frequency under the source cell MO.
- An EUtranCellRelation MO must exist under the target EUtranFreqRelation MO for each possible target cell.
- Each EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute under the target EUtranFreqRelation MO must be set to true.
