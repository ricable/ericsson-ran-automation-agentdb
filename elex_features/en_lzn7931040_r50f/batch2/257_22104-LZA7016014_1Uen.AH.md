Summary

The Service Specific Load Management feature is an add-on to the following features:

- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA
- Inter-Frequency Offload

The Service Specific Load Management feature has the following benefits:

- A UE is allowed to be offloaded to a neighbor cell on another frequency if the UE reports better RSRP to the neighbor cell than to an absolute threshold.
- A UE is allowed to be offloaded to a UTRAN cell if the UE reports better RSCP to the UTRAN cell than to an absolute threshold.
- It can be controlled how the users are selected for load management action based on the used services, for example by the following actions: Requiring better target coverage for users with a certain service (VoIP) to qualify for load-triggered handovers to a higher E-UTRAN frequency Inhibiting users with a certain service (VoIP) from load-triggered handovers to a higher E-UTRAN frequency Inhibiting users with a certain service (VoIP) from load-triggered handovers to a UTRAN frequency Requiring that a user has a certain service (VoIP) to qualify for load-triggered handovers to a UTRAN frequency

# 3 Feature Operation of Service Specific Load Management

This feature enhances the control of the UE selection process for the Inter-frequency

Load Balancing, Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA, and Inter-frequency Offload features.

When a UE is selected for load balancing, it is evaluated which of the target E-UTRAN or

UTRAN frequencies the UE supports. A UE is assigned one target frequency for each load

balancing cycle. The length of the load balancing cycle is determined by the

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCycle attribute.

The QCI-dependent UE selection criteria for target E-UTRAN frequencies is controlled by the

EutranFreqToQciProfileRelation struct, which

encapsulates parameters for specific QCI profiles. Two of these parameters are associated with

the QoS class and the E-UTRAN frequency involved,

lbA5Threshold2RsrpOffset and

lbQciProfileHandling.

QCI Profile Handling

The lbQciProfileHandling parameter

specifies conditions for the presence of the associated QCI in the E-RAB configuration of a

UE selected for LBA to target cells on the E-UTRAN frequency.

RSRP

The lbA5Threshold2RsrpOffset parameter is an offset for the A5 measurement

threshold2. It is applied in the A5 measurement reporting criteria for a UE that has a

bearer with the associated QCI. A5 measurement is used to enable load balancing actions for UEs

that are configured for Carrier Aggregation.

The largest offset is applied if the UE uses more than one QCI.

The lbA5Threshold2RsrpOffset is not applicable when configured for a

QCI set to FORBIDDEN. In this case, the UE is excluded from load balancing

and no measurement is initiated.

RSRQ

The lbA5Threshold2RsrqOffset parameter is an offset to the RSRQ

threshold2 value for A5 measurement. The offset is applied in the handover evaluation criteria for

a UE with the associated QCI. When a measurement report is received, it is checked if the

target RSRQ value exceeds the threshold plus the value of the

lbA5Threshold2RsrqOffset parameter. If it does not, the load

balancing action is ended.

The largest offset is applied if the UE uses more than one QCI.

The lbA5Threshold2RsrqOffset offset is not applicable when configured

for a QCI set to FORBIDDEN. In this case, the UE is excluded from load

balancing and no measurement is initiated.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Service Specific Load Management

This feature can be used to exclude mission-critical PTT UEs from load-triggered

handovers because handovers have a negative effect on voice quality.

Subscriber Triggered Mobility and Preferential Traffic

Management can be used to configure load-based handover of UEs based on SPID for

each frequency. Subscriber Triggered Mobility, Preferential Traffic Management and

Service Specific Load Management can be used together to configure optimal operation

for mission-critical PTT UEs.

It is possible to individually configure the load-based handover to another E-UTRAN

frequency for each QCI with the Service Specific Load Management feature. This

allows that load-based handover is allowed for mission-critical PTT users without

active PTT calls, forbidden when a PTT call is active.

The load-based handovers based on QCI can be configured with following

attributes:

| E-UTRAN frequency   |    | The lbQciProfileHandling attribute of                                 EUtranFreqRelation.eutranFreqToQciProfileRelation.   |
|---------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                            |
| UTRAN frequency     |    | The lbQciProfileHandling attribute of                                 UtranFreqRelation.utranFreqToQciProfileRelation.     |

Mobility based on SPID can be used for adjusting the handover of UEs together with

QCI-based mobility. The following attributes are used for configuring mobility based

on SPID:

| E-UTRAN frequency   |    | The loadBalancingAllowed and                                 offloadAllowed  attributes of                                 RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA.   |
|---------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| UTRAN frequency     |    | The loadBalancingAllowed attribute of                                 RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListUTRA.                                                         |
