Summary

The Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs feature identifies scheduling

resources allocated to out-of-coverage UEs and releases them for reallocation in the

following ways:

- Prolonged periodic granting decreases the uplink DTX counter, therefore freeing up resources for other scheduling.
- Clearing data for bearers removes the need to schedule the queue of out-of-coverage UEs, which saves the time required to empty a long queue estimation. In this case the uplink DTX counter is decreased, which also releases scheduling resources.

The uplink throughput of the cell increases during high-load conditions when there

are many out-of-coverage UEs.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs

This section describes the UE states and the main process steps of the Uplink

Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs feature.

The Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs maintains two UE states (implicit

state):

- out-of-coverage
- in-coverage

A DTX count is maintained to determine if the coverage state should change.

Table 2   UE States

| State           | Condition                                                                                                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| out-of-coverage | outOfCoverageThreshold ≤ DTXcount ≤                   outOfCoverageMax, where outOfCoverageMax =                   outOfCoverageThreshold +                 outOfCoverageDepth. | In this state, non-VoLTE UE handling is changed as follows:  Uplink Granting is sparse when the uplink granting periodicity for the UE is                       set to the value specified in                         EUtranCellFDD.outOfCoverageSrTimerPeriodicity or                         EUtranCellTDD.outOfCoverageSrTimerPeriodicity.     BSR Buffer Size is decreased by the system.     Buffer Handling: bearer data buffers for the UE are cleared. |

The state transitions are the following:

- If CRC=ok, then the UE is considered as in-coverage. The uplink DTX counter history is reset to zero.
- If DTX=true, then the uplink DTX counter is incremented. When DTXcount ≥ outOfCoverageThreshold, the UE is considered as out-of-coverage.
- If DTX=false, then the uplink DTX counter is decremented. When DTXcount &lt; outOfCoverageThreshold, then the UE is considered as in-coverage.

# 6 Performance of Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs

This section describes the PDCCH Error Rate and  Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput KPIs,

and counters associated with the Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs

feature.

KPIs

The following KPIs and PIs are associated with this feature:

- PDCCH Error Rate Due to the reduced number of OOC UEs, the PDCCH Error Rate is expected to decrease. It is caused by the lower number of PDCCH packets sent to such UEs.
- UL Throughput Since the feature reduces the inefficient use of UL resources by the OOC UEs, uplink throughput can increase.

For more information about KPIs, see Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

The following counters are associated with the Uplink Scheduling Control for

Out-of-Coverage UEs feature:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmOocNewDataUlGrants
- EUtranCellFDD.pmOocStateEntries
- EUtranCellFDD.pmOocStateExits
- EUtranCellFDD.pmOocStateExitsUeRel
- EUtranCellFDD.pmOocUesLevSum
- EUtranCellTDD.pmOocNewDataUlGrants
