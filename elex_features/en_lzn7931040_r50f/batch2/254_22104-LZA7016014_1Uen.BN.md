# 1 Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation Overview

The feature makes it possible to add and unlock an LTE cell with a downlink-only

carrier.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

A cell typically consists of an uplink and a downlink component carrier. Supplemental

downlink-only cells are an exception where there is only a downlink component carrier.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Spectrum utilization on bands defined as downlink-only, for example, Band 29, using carrier aggregation
- Increased downlink UE peak throughput
- Increased aggregated downlink throughput and capacity

Hardware

This feature is not supported on AIR 3283 and on AIR 3284.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The UE must support carrier aggregation and the aggregated bands.

# 3 Feature Operation of Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

The feature allows a carrier aggregation-capable UE to use the supplemental downlink

only cell as a secondary component carrier.

Operational Process

The feature makes it possible to add and unlock an E-UTRAN cell with only downlink

carrier, for example, Band 29. This means that no uplink carrier is needed. The

downlink only cell is used as a downlink SCell in carrier aggregation.

Additionally, an FDD or TDD downlink only cell which is configured as barred through

setting the EUtranCellFDD.cellBarred or

EUtranCellTDD.cellBarred parameter to BARRED

can also be used as an SCell when the feature is active and the cell is configured

as an SCell candidate.

# 4 Network Impact of Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

The Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation feature has an impact on

mobility.

Capacity and Performance

Cells that are configured as downlink only cannot be used as Primary Cells (PCells)

and must never be the target of any handover. The eNodeB does not do any handovers

using a cell relation if the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed

attribute is set to false.

The eNodeB will not use frequency relations if the

EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio,

EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio, and

EUtranFreqRelation.arpPrio attributes are set to âˆ’1. These

settings on the frequency relations where downlink only configured cells exist

ensure that no mobility triggered release with redirect or handover happens to these

frequencies.

When a cell is configured as downlink only, all incoming X2 and S1 handover

preparations are rejected, even if the relation exists.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

is also affected by an existing parameter and affects several parameters.

This attribute depends on

EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl or

EUtranCellTDD.earfcnul and they are

set together. The EUtranCellFDD.earfcnul

or EUtranCellTDD.earfcnul and

EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl or

EUtranCellTDD.earfcndl values are

dependent and relate according to the default E-UTRA TX

channel to RX channel separation as specified in 3GPP

TS 36.101, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access

(E-UTRA); User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and

reception for the E-UTRA operating band and

channel bandwidth of the cell.

# 6 Performance of Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

The Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation feature is associated with several

KPIs, counters, and events.

KPIs

The feature can be observed with the same KPIs as the Carrier Aggregation feature.

Counters

Handover is not supported for downlink only cells. The

EUtranCellFDD.pmHoPrepRejInDlOnlyCell Performance Management

(PM) counter pegs if the incoming handover preparation rejection cause is due to the

downlink only target cell.

Events

Table 3   Events

| Event                       | Event Parameter             | Description                                               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| INTERNAL_PROC_HO_PREP_X2_IN | EVENT_PARAM_HO_REJECT_CAUSE | Updated with new failure cause REJECT_DUE_TO_DL_ONLY_CELL |
| INTERNAL_PROC_HO_PREP_S1_IN | EVENT_PARAM_HO_REJECT_CAUSE | Updated with new failure cause REJECT_DUE_TO_DL_ONLY_CELL |

# 7 Activate Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011567 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011567 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q1: TDD Support for Supplemental Downlink Carrier Aggregation

The

feature enhancement adds support for TDD for the Supplemental Downlink Carrier Aggregation

feature.

| Feature Name:           | Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3068                                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation                             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405                                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                             |

Summary of Benefits

The feature enhancement enables TDD configuration in the Supplemental Downlink

Carrier Aggregation feature. It also introduces the following benefits:

- Decreases frequency interferences in the uplink channel.
- Enables spectrum utilization on cells defined as TDD downlink-only, using carrier aggregation.
- Allows carrier aggregation in downlink using an ordinary TDD carrier operated without uplink, and serving as a secondary cell candidate for several primary cells.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the EUtranCellTDD.isDlOnly

attribute.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements
