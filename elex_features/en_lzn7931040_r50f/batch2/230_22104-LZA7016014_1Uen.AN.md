# 1 OTDOA Control Plane Location Support Overview

The OTDOA Control Plane Location Support feature allows for the configuration of the

Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). The feature also enables the eNodeB to provide precise

cell frame timing to the OSS.

Summary

The OTDOA Control Plane Location Support feature enables the operator to configure the PRS.

The PRS serves as the basis for the OTDOA method defined in 3GPP.

A sequence of subframes (one, two, four, or six) transmitting the PRS is referred to

as a PRS occasion. No other data is scheduled in the positioning reference signal

subframe apart from the PRS. In this way, the interference in the sequence of

subframes can be minimized. The subframes are referred to as LISs.

The operator determines the following parameters of the feature:

- The periodicity of the radio frames containing the PRS
- The number of subframes transmitting the PRS at every transmit occasion

The UE measures PRSs from multiple eNodeBs along with the following data:

- Geographical information of the eNodeBs
- The relative downlink timing of eNodeBs

The estimate of the UE position can be established on such basis.

The positioning node is in the control plane architecture called E-SMLC. The OTDOA method

requires the positioning node to know the exact cell frame timing. The positioning

node can retrieve cell frame timing information from the OSS. The feature enables

the eNodeB to provide the OSS precise cell frame timing.

The OTDOA method allows for the following functions:

- Sufficient positioning accuracy (50-200 m) to serve as fallback to the A-GPS method
- Compliance with the FCC phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning of emergency calls

These functions also provide information on the location of the customer. Standalone, the

OTDOA method can serve to position a wide variety of commercial services based on UE

location.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The eNodeBs must be synchronized using the Clock Source Over GPS feature, or the IEEE

1588 Time and Phase Synchronization feature. If the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase

Synchronization feature is used, the PTP input accuracy must be 150 ns or better.

The accuracy is calculated according to the ITU-T G.8275.1, and the

ITU-T G.8271.1 guidelines. The required PTP input accuracy must be

accounted for during network planning. The eNodeBs cannot detect an absolute time

error.

# 3 Feature Operation of OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

PRS broadcasting occurs in a cell where the OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

Feature is active. PRSs are broadcast in accordance with the configuration defined by the

operator. The section describes the specifics of PRS configuration.

Low Interfered Subframes

The data region in a PRS subframe can contain PDSCH data. In such cases, the accuracy of

the estimated UE position decreases due to increased interference. Therefore, PDSCH

transmissions in PRS subframes are not performed if they reduce the impact of OTDOA on the

scheduler.

Power Scaling

The configuration of the eNodeB determines the power scaling of the PRS. The eNodeB is

configured for one or two cell-specific TX antenna ports. In case of two cell-specific TX

antenna ports, the PRS is transmitted from only one antenna each transmit occasion. The

following scaling of the amplitude applies to the PRS.

APRS = √Na*Areference

The only values for Na are 1 and 2. Therefore, scaling with two antennas doubles

the PRS resource power elements on the antenna transmitting the PRS.

Mapping of Resource Elements

Figure 1 shows the mapping of resource elements

to one or two antennas.

# 4 Network Impact of OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

Capacity and Performance

User data is not scheduled in subframes where the PRS signals are transmitted, that is, in

the LIS. This means that some of the downlink cell capacity is lost.Capacity loss is

specified differently on FDD and TDD.

FDD Capacity Loss for the OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

Capacity loss depends on the following characteristics:

- The periodicity of the PRS frames
- The number of subframes in each PRS occasion

Downlink capacity loss is 3.75% if the following conditions apply:

- A periodicity of 160 ms
- Six consecutive subframes are used for PRS signaling

In a more typical configuration with the following conditions, downlink capacity loss is

0.31%:

- A periodicity of 1280 ms
- Four consecutive subframes are used for PRS signaling

TDD Capacity Loss for the OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

Capacity loss depends on the following characteristics:

- The periodicity of the PRS frames
- The number of subframes in each PRS occasion
- The number of downlink subframes in each radio frame

Downlink capacity loss is 6.25% if the following conditions apply:

- A periodicity of 160 ms
- All four (subframe assignment 1), or all six (subframe assignment 2) downlink subframes are used for PRS signaling

In a more typical configuration with the following conditions, downlink capacity loss

is 0.39%:

- A periodicity of 1280 ms
- Two out of four (subframe assignment 1) downlink subframes are used for PRS

Downlink capacity loss is 0.52% if the same periodicity applies, and four out of six

(subframe assignment 2) downlink subframes are used for PRS. For the sake of simplicity, the

downlink capacity of the special subframes are not considered in the calculations.

Interfaces

The feature does not impact interfaces.

Other Network Elements

The feature does not impact other network elements.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

The operator must enter cell parameters, lock and unlock cells to configure the

feature. The unlocking of cells fails if erroneous cell parameters are set.

## 9.1 Entering Cell Parameters

The operator enters the cell parameters needed for location support as the first step of the

feature activation process. The EUtranCellFDD or

EUtranCellTDD MOs define the cell parameters.

Certain generic cell parameters also have to be entered if location support is defined for a

new cell. For information on the generic parameters, see Radio Network Configuration.

The parameters can be grouped into the following types:

- Cell identification parameters (if the cell is new)
- Cell frequency and cell power parameters (if the cell is new)
- PRS configuration parameters
- Cell geographical parameters
- Cell timing parameters
- Feature activation parameters on cell level

## 9.2 Locking and Unlocking Cells

For the entered parameters to take effect, the cell must be manually locked and unlocked. The

cell parameters can also be entered when the cell is in a locked state. In such cases, the

parameters take effect when the cell is unlocked. This means that the PRSs are transmitted

according to the set parameter values. The scheduling of user data stops in the subframes

where the PRS is transmitted.

At cell unlock, the following events occur:

- The GNSS time stamp for the latest occurrence of SFN0 is retrieved.
- The corresponding read-only MOM parameters are set by the eNodeB.

The MOM parameters are updated whenever a change of synchronization state takes place in

the cell.

## 9.3 Unlocking Cells Fails due to Erroneous Parameter Settings

The operator sets the parameter prsConfigIndex in MO classes

EUtranCellTDD and EUtranCellFDD. The parameter

determines the PRS period and the PRS subframe offset. When configuring

prsConfigIndex, the eNodeB ensures that this setting does not cause a

collision in the air between the PRS signals and the SIB1 message. If there is a collision,

the cell does not become active. The operator must try another setting before trying to unlock

the cell. The following alarm is issued in the Additional text section:

Parameter setting not supported: prs. This means that the

current PRS setting causes collision with SIB1. As this is not acceptable, the operator must

try another PRS setting.

In addition, eNodeB checks that PRS collides with CSI Reference Signal as well. If there is a

collision between PRS and CSI Reference Signal, the cell does not become active and the

operator must try another setting for prsConfigIndex before trying to

unlock the cell. An alarm is issued that in the additional text state parameter setting is not

supported, which means unsupported CSI Reference Signal configuration. This means that the

current PRS setting causes collision with CSI Reference Signal or Current CSI Reference Signal

configurations are not supported. As this is not acceptable, the operator must try another PRS

or CSI Reference Signal setting.

# 10 Privacy Functionality for OTDOA Control Plane Location Support

The OTDOA method defined in 3GPP is based on PRS configuration. This feature enables the

operator to configure the PRS.

The UE measures PRSs from multiple eNodeBs and also receives the following

information:

- Geographical information of the eNodeB-positions
- The relative downlink timing of the eNodeBs

On such basis, an estimate of the UE-position can be established.

The OTDOA method provides sufficient positioning accuracy (50-200 m) to serve as a

fallback method for the A-GPS method. It also enables the operator to comply with the

FCC phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning of emergency calls. This also means

that the location information of the customer is known.
