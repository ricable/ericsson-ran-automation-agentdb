# 1 Radio Resource Partitioning Overview

This feature enables the configuration of predefined shares of radio resources in a

network, when the resources are shared between user categories.

Summary

The Radio Resource Partitioning feature ensures fair radio resource use in a network where

resources are shared between user categories. This includes different PLMNs in a shared LTE

RAN or networks that are geographically split. In these networks, different user categories

can be prioritized. The prioritization depends on the QoS settings or the presence of large

differences in user numbers for each category.

The feature enables the configuration in which the radio resources are shared among the

partitions based on the predefined shares. The partitions are based on PLMN for operators

sharing the radio network. For specific groups of UEs, the partitions are based on SPID

values.

SRBs are not partitioned, while non-GBR data bearers are always partitioned. GBR bearers,

including VoLTE, PTT, IMS or Mission Critical (MC) signaling bearers are partitioned only

when the ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning attribute is set to

TRUE.

Radio resources, that is, PRBs and SEs, can be shared by configuring two shares in each

partition. The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare

attribute represents the share that is taken into consideration in the contention scenario.

The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute

represents the maximum share that a partition can use.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Available resources are shared among the partitions based on the configured maximum share, while ensuring that each partition can use the radio resources that correspond to the configured share when required.
- UE throughput increases for partitions which have a lower share of the traffic relative to the configured resource share.
- Used resources are limited to the maximum share defined by ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare, regardless of the available unused capacity in the cell. This way, the use of unlimited resources can be restricted in shared LTE RAN deployments.
- Bearers in one partition are scheduled by QoS only in relation to bearers in the same partition. This prevents higher QoS users in one partition from taking resources that are assigned to lower QoS users in another partition.

This is because the             feature is not partition-aware and dynamic UE admission control is not available on a             partition level. This means that an overloaded partition can effectively disable the low             energy scheduler solution, because the criteria for the delay of traffic data             transmission are not met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

When the PCell establishes cell relation             for carrier aggregation with the SCell,             if the SCell is shared             between operators and RRP is used,             then             the PCell must be configured to use RRP depending on the type of carrier aggregation             involved. The RRP configuration on the PCell must define the same partitions as defined             on the SCell to have compatible RRP configuration. The partitions that are not valid for             PCell cannot be             configured             with no share.

# 3 Feature Operation of Radio Resource Partitioning

This feature allows the configuration of predefined shares for radio

resources.

The feature can be configured to partition bearers based on the serving PLMN of the UE or

the SPID value of the UE. The partitions and the corresponding radio resource shares are

configured on a cell level. Up to six partitions can be configured in each cell. The

partitions are used for non-GBR data or for both GBR and non-GBR data, depending on the

configuration. The partitions are prioritized depending on the current partition use and

the configuration of the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute.

The partitions are limited based on the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare

attribute.

The configuration changes take effect at cell unlock. The use of uplink and downlink PRBs

for each partition can be observed by OSS PM counters.

It is recommended that the following bearers have the same value of the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.paPartitionOverride or the

QciProfilePredefined.paPartitionOverride attribute:

- VOIP and IMS signaling bearers
- PTT and Mission Critical (MC) signaling bearers

Prioritized bearers can be excluded from being partitioned by setting the value of the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.paPartitionOverride or the

QciProfilePredefined.paPartitionOverride attribute to

true for specific QCIs.

Operational Process

1. The system tracks resource use for each configured partition, defined as uplink or downlink PRBs and SEs, divided by the maximum available resources. These resources are adjusted by subtracting the number of non-partitioned PRBs and SEs.
2. Partitions that use more than the amount of resources configured in the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute are down-prioritized. The down prioritized bearers are scheduled until the limit defined in the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute is reached and resources in the cell are available. High SRB, paging, or any other non-partitioned traffic load reduces the amount of resources that are available for partitioning. If any non-partitioned resource, such as CCEs becomes limiting, this can affect the functionality so that configured shares do not match. When the coverage is poor, CCE use can decrease.
    1. It is possible that not all available resources are configured for use in a cell by the partitions. The partitions that have the highest load compared to their configured share are more likely to receive the remaining resources up to the value of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute.
    2. More resources can be configured for the partitions in a cell than the number of available partitions. The partitions that have the highest load compared to their configured share are more likely to receive their full contention share.
3. Competition for the same resources can happen in the following ways:
    1. Between partitions, prioritization is done according to used resources and the configuration of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute.
    2. Within the partition, prioritization is done according to the QoS priority.
4. Resource use is measured and adjusted in every TTI.

## 3.1 Bearer Setup and Modification

Bearers are assigned to a partition during bearer setup or modification.

Figure 1   Bearer Setup and Modification

1. Bearer setup is initiated by initial context setup, dedicated bearer establishment or a mobility action. Bearer modification is initiated by the modification of a QoS profile.
2. SRB traffic is not partitioned and its priority does not change. Priority access bearers are not added to a partition if the value of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.paPartitionOverride or the QciProfilePredefined.paPartitionOverride attribute is set to true for the corresponding QCI.
3. If the value of the ResourcePartitons.gbrPartitioning attribute is set to true, GBR bearers are assigned to the appropriate partition based on the serving PLMN or SPID value of the UE and partitioning is applied for GBR traffic.
4. If the value of the ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning attribute is set to false, then GBR, IMS, and Mission Critical (MC) signaling bearers are not partitioned.
5. The remaining bearers are assigned to the appropriate partition based on the serving PLMN or SPID value of the UE. Partitioning is also applied for GBR traffic.
6. Partition information is used during scheduling to ensure the fair use of radio resources according to the configured shares.

Non-GBR bearers for which PLMN or SPID is not assigned to any partition are always down

prioritized. For more information on GBR bearers, see Dynamic GBR Admission Control.

Resource Partition Configuration

## 3.2 Scheduling

Bearers are down prioritized if they belong to an overused partition.

Partition use cannot exceed the value set in the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute.

Figure 2   Scheduling

1. All bearers with data to send are checked if they are SRBs or bearers that are not partitioned.
2. All remaining bearers are checked to determine if the maximum partition limit is exceeded. If the maximum partition limit is exceeded, the bearer is not scheduled.
3. All remaining bearers are checked to determine if they belong to a partition that overuses its configured share in the previous TTI.
4. Bearers from overused partitions are down prioritized. If no partition overuses its share in the previous TTI, no bearers are down prioritized.
5. The resulting list is sent to the scheduler. In case of resource contention, bearers belonging to down prioritized partitions are the last to be scheduled. Note: Non-GBR bearers for which PLMN or SPID is not assigned to any partition are always down prioritized. For more information on GBR bearers, see Dynamic GBR Admission Control.

## 3.3 Admission Control

The GBR bearer functions of the Dynamic GBR Admission Control and the Differentiated

Admission Control features are enhanced to work on a partition level.

### 3.3.1 Dynamic GBR Admission Control

The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature ensures that QoS is maintained for

established GBR bearers.

The feature allows the setup of GBR bearers if the configured threshold is not exceeded.

The value of the ResourcePartitions.gbrAdmCtrlPerPartition attribute

can be set to true to activate the feature on a partition level. The

following prerequisites must be fulfilled:

- The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature must be activated.
- The value of the ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning attribute must be set to true.

The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature enables the acceptance or rejection of incoming

GBR requests based on MSR use. If the feature is activated on a partition level,

partition MSRs are considered in addition to cell and BBM MSRs. The following partition

MSRs are considered:

- Uplink GBR PRB
- Downlink GBR PRB
- Uplink GBR SE
- Downlink GBR SE
- GBR CCE

Figure 3   Admission Algorithm

Configured Threshold

The AdmissionControl.dlAdmDifferentiationThr and

AdmissionControl.ulAdmDifferentiationThr attributes are

applied on a partition level by using the value of the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare

attribute.

Dynamic GBR Admission Control on partition level rejects all GBR bearers that fulfill

any of the following conditions:

- The GBR bearer belongs to a partition in which the value of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute is set to 0.
- The GBR bearer with PLMN or the SPID is not assigned to any partition.

These GBR bearers can be admitted but are down prioritized on the following

conditions:

- The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is not enabled on a partition level.
- The GBR traffic is partitioned.

### 3.3.2 Differentiated Admission Control

The GBR bearer function of the Differentiated Admission Control feature can be

enabled on a partition level.

The GBR bearer function of the Differentiated Admission Control feature can be enabled on

a partition level by applying the overload threshold, that is, the

AdmissionControl.dlAdmOverloadThr or the

AdmissionControl.ulAdmOverloadThr attribute on a partition level.

After the overload threshold is exceeded on a partition, cell, or BBM level, GBR bearers

that are not mobility or privileged access GBR bearers are rejected.

All GBR bearers are blocked if the value of the

ResourcePartitions.rrpAdmCtrlRejPaReqOvlGbr attribute is set to

true. This includes GBR bearers with privileged access. The setup

requests for privileged access GBR bearers can trigger bearer preemption if preemption

is enabled and dynamic GBR load is above the overload threshold on partition level or

cell level.

Only a privileged access GBR bearer can be a candidate bearer for preemption if the

following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is enabled on a partition level.
- The Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated.
- The value of the AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState attribute is set to activated.
- The value of the ResourcePartitions.rrpAdmCtrlRejPaReqOvlGbr attribute is set to true.

Non-privileged access GBR bearers that are blocked because of cell or partition MSR are

not candidates for preemption.

Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) blocking level is not supported on a partition

level. ARP blocking level that is calculated on a cell level is not considered when the

Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is enabled on a partition level.

Interaction

## 3.4 Resource Partition Configuration

The configuration is done by creating ResourcePartition and

ResourcePartitionGroup MOs, which define the share of radio

resources.

Figure 5   MO Structure for Radio Resource Partitioning

1. A set of ResourcePartition MOs is created. The ResourcePartition.plmnList attribute is used if partitioning is done based on PLMN, and ResourcePartition.spidList attribute is used if partitioning is done based on SPID. Note: The SPID value of 0 can exist in the ResourcePartition.spidList to include UEs with no SPID value set by the core network. A partition can be configured by using an empty ResourcePartition.spidList which includes all UEs with any SPID value.
2. A ResourcePartitionGroup MO is created. The group contains up to six ResourcePartitionGroupMember MOs. Each MO references an existing ResourcePartition MO and defines two shares (in percentage) for each partition. The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute is considered in the contention scenario. The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute represents the maximum share that a partition can use.
3. The ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning attribute can be set to TRUE to enable the partitioning of GBR traffic.
4. The value of the ResourcePartitions.gbrAdmCtrlPerPartition attribute can be set to true to enable the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature on a partition level. For the feature to be operational on a partition level, the feature must be activated and the value of the ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning attribute must be set to true.
5. The ResourcePartitions.rrpAdmCtrlRejPaReqOvlGbr attribute, which is set to true by default, is used to reject GBR bearers with priority access after the overload threshold is reached. It is considered when the Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated and the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is enabled on a partition level.

It is possible to use the same partitioning criteria, that is, the value of the

ResourcePartition.plmnList or the

ResourcePartition.spidList attribute, in different cells with different

shares by creating additional ResourcePartititonGroup MOs. These MOs must

refer to the same ResourcePartition MOs but configure different shares.

Each cell that uses the Radio Resource Partitioning feature refers to a

ResourcePartitionGroup MO using the

EUtranCellFDD.resourcePartitionGroupRef or the

EUtranCellTDD.resourcePartitionGroupRef

attribute.

### 3.4.1 Resource Partition Configurations for Cells in Carrier Aggregation Relations

To have compatible resource partition configuration for cells in carrier aggregation

relation, the suggested configurations have to be followed.

All PCells need to have partition configurations. For compatible resource partition

configuration for cells in carrier aggregation relations, the respective PCells or

SCells must configure the same subset of resource partitions for use in the node. In

case the cells do not have the same subset of resource partitions, negative KPI impact

is possible, such as throughput

degradation.

In this case, each partition must be defined with a combination of the following

attribute values on all nodes:

- ResourcePartition.partitionID
- ResourcePartition.plmnList
- ResourcePartition.spidList

The configuration of a ResourcePartitionGroup MO with a list of

attributes in the ResourcePartitionGroupMember

MO,

each referencing a specific resource partition, defines the resource partition

configuration on a cell level. All cells must

involve

the same ResourcePartitionGroup or different

ResourcePartitionGroup MOs that are configured to be consistent

and compatible.

The

configurations of different ResourcePartitionGroup MOs are consistent

and compatible if they involve the same number of attributes in the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember MO, that reference the same

ResourcePartition MOs.

If certain

ResourcePartitionGroupMember MOs are configured with no share, it can

still be considered compatible.

# 4 Network Impact of Radio Resource Partitioning

This feature affects UE measurement reports.

Capacity and Performance

In case of incorrect configuration of the feature, throughput KPI might degrade. For

suggested configuration options, see Resource Partition Configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Measurement reports from the UEs can be delayed because of resource partitioning.

# 6 Performance of Radio Resource Partitioning

This feature has KPI impact. The feature has related events with which the resource

partitions can be observed.

KPIs

This feature does not introduce or update any KPIs. The feature can have a negative

KPI impact in the following cases:

- If the resource demands on a partition level exceed the share.
- If the resource demands on a partition level are counter-proportional to the share.
- If the resource partition is not configured, partly configured, or incorrectly configured according to the requirements in Resource Partition Configuration.

The

pmPrbUlUtilDistrPartitionN and the

pmPrbDlUtilDistrPartitionN flexible EBS-L PM counters are

added for each partition, for downlink and uplink PRBs. These counters show the

percentage use of the total available resources and are calculated in ENM using the

EBS-L function. The calculation happens by post-processing the cell traces that are

sent by the radio, which generates additional performance files.

For these EBS-L PM counters to be generated and processed the following tools are

required:

- EBS-L function in ENM
- ENIQ\_statistics server or any other Northbound PM tool

For more information on EBS-L PM counters, see Manage Performance.

The number of created counters depends on the number of partitions that are

configured in the eNodeB. The N in the counter name corresponds to the value of the

ResourcePartition.partitionId attribute that is configured in

the MO.

The gains and benefits of the feature can be observed by examining the counters and

comparing them to the configured share. This method is only possible in a controlled

scenario with full buffer traffic in each partition. In such a scenario, the

partitions must be fully utilized.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: Static Resource Sharing

This enhancement introduces static resource sharing in shared network

deployments.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Name:           | Radio Resource Partitioning        |
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4571                       |
| Value Package Name:     | RAN Slicing                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0570                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |

This enhancement allows the operator to control if a cell uses static or dynamic

(default) resource sharing in Radio Resource Partitioning. In case of static resource

sharing, the non-GBR traffic is strictly limited even if free resources are available in

another partition of the cell. As a result, preconfigured shares for PLMN-based or

SPID-based partitions can be applied both in resource contention and other configuration

types.

Benefits

Static resource partitioning does not allow non-GBR traffic to exceed the configured

share, even if unused capacity is available in the cell. In this way, the use of

unlimited resources can be restricted in shared LTE RAN deployments.

Capacity and Performance

The resource limitation for each partition can lower capacity utilization in each

cell. Lower capacity can lead to throughput degradation.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the

ResourcePartitioningGroup.resourceSharingType attribute to

control if the functionality is enabled for a specific cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 19.4 or later is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q2: GBR Partitioning

This feature enhancement enables the partitioning of GBR bearer, as well as IMS and

mission-critical (MC) signaling bearers. It also enables to override partition settings for

priority access bearers to prevent partitioning them.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Name:           | Radio Resource Partitioning        |
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4571                       |
| Value Package Name:     | RAN Slicing                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0570                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |

This enhancement can be used only with Dynamic Resource Sharing. To secure the priority

access traffic in case of emergency, the partition override configuration for priority

access bearers is introduced as well.

Benefits

With this enhancement, the operator can decide if GBR, IMS and MC signaling bearers

are partitioned in the same way as the non-GBR data bearer.

Capacity and Performance

If the cell is overloaded and there is uneven share of GBR bearer in each partition,

GBR QoS degradation can be expected. For example, when in one partition the GBR load

is high, and in the other partition, the GBR load is low.

Operation

This enhancement introduces the following MOM attributes:

- ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning
- QciProfilePredefined.paPartitionOverride
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.paPartitionOverride

Benefits of this enhancement can be observed in GBR or non-GBR bearer scenarios with

the following existing PM counters:

- pmPrbDlUtilDistrPartition
- pmPrbUlUtilDistrPartition

The enhancement introduces the following PM counters to check the GBR use for each

partition:

- pmPrbDlUtilGbrDistrPartition
- pmPrbUlUtilGbrDistrPartition

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.1 or later is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.c: 21.Q1: Flexible Resource Sharing and Dynamic GBR Admission Control on a Partition Level

This enhancement extends the function of the Radio Resource Partitioning feature by

adding support for dynamic GBR admission control on a partition level. The enhancement also

enables the definition of resource sharing type on a partition level.

| Feature Name:           | Radio Resource Partitioning   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4571                  |
| Value Package Name:     | RAN Slicing                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0570                  |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node           |
| Access Type:            | LTE                           |

With this enhancement, the operator can define resource sharing type for each partition

by configuring the following attributes:

- The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute is introduced to represent the percentage of the maximum resources the partition can use.
- The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute is taken into consideration in the contention scenario.

The ResourcePartitionGroup.resourceSharingType

attribute is deprecated. The upgrade procedure automatically configures the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute

based on the following configurations:

- If the ResourcePartitionGroup.resourceSharingType attribute is set to STATIC, the value of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute equals the value of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute.
- If the ResourcePartitionGroup.resourceSharingType attribute is set to DYNAMIC, the value of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute is set to 100.

Benefits

This enhancement has the following benefits:

- By using two shares for each partition, the resource sharing type can be defined on a partition level.
- GBR traffic can be partitioned in all resource sharing scenarios.
- The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature can be enabled on a partition level. The differentiation threshold is also applied on a partition level.

Capacity and Performance

When the value of the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare attribute

equals the value of the

ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare

attribute after the upgrade procedure, the limitation that prevents the partition of

GBR traffic is removed by this enhancement. In this case, the following values are

improved:

- Partition utilization
- Cell utilization
- Cell throughput

This enhancement has the following KPI impact:

- If the GBR load is proportional to the partition share, there is no KPI impact.
- If the GBR load exceeds the capacity of the partition, the Accessibility KPI is negatively impacted because of the increased number of GBR bearer setup rejections by the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature.
- If the GBR load is high and not proportional to the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionShare partition, there is a positive impact on QoS and Retainability KPIs.

Operation

- The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute controls the upper limit that a partition can use. The default value of the attribute is 100%. By using two shares for each partition, resource sharing type can be configured for each partition within a cell.
- The ResourcePartitionGroup.resourceSharingType attribute, which operates on cell level, is deprecated. The ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare attribute is used to configure the required resource sharing mode.Note: During the upgrade procedure, the value of the ResourcePartitionGroupMember.resourcePartitionMaxShare is set automatically based on the value of the ResourcePartitionGroup.resourceSharingType attribute.
- If the Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated and the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature activated on a partition level, then the overload threshold is introduced on a partition level.
- Support is added for the preemption of blocked GBR privileged access bearers inside the partition to which they belong.Note: The ARP blocking level is not calculated on a partition level. ARP blocking level that is calculated on a cell level is not taken into consideration when the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is activated on a partition level.
- The ResourcePartitions.gbrAdmCtrlPerPartition attribute controls whether the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is activated on a partition level when the value of the ResourcePartitions.gbrPartitioning attribute is set to TRUE. This is applicable to cells in which the Radio Resource Partitioning feature is active.Note: The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature must be activated for this function to be operational.
- The ResourcePartitions.rrpAdmCtrlRejPaReqOvlGbr attribute controls whether the GBR privileged access bearers are rejected when the overload threshold is exceeded on a cell or a partition level. This is applicable to cells in which the Radio Resource Partitioning feature is active.Note: The Dynamic GBR Admission Control and Differentiated Admission Control features must be activated for this function to be operational.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 20.3 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

## Appendix A.d: 22.Q1: Improved Handling of External Traffic on ESCell Side in Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation Scenario without Traffic Being Partitioned

This feature enhancement enables the correct external traffic handling on the ESCell

if the Radio Resource Partitioning feature is configured and activated on that cell.

Only local traffic is

partitioned based on the resource partition configuration of the

ESCell.

| Feature Name           | Radio Resource Partitioning   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4571                  |
| Value Package Name     | RAN Slicing                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0570                  |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node           |
| Access Type            | LTE                           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement removes the conflicting relationship between the Radio

Resource Partitioning and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

features.

The resources used for external traffic on the ESCell side are not partitioned, and

local traffic follows the legacy resource partition

rules.

This feature enhancement also removes the limitation on the configuration of the

Radio Resource Partitioning feature. This allows the cells in carrier aggregation

relation on the same eNodeB to reference different

ResourcePartitionGroup MOs.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement is enabled automatically if the Radio Resource Partitioning

and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are configured and activated

together on the ESCell.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.e: 22.Q4: Improved Handling of Elastic RAN with Remote Traffic Being Partitioned

The

Radio Resource Partitioning feature can be used with the Elastic RAN

feature, in which case the resources used for local traffic and remote carrier aggregation

traffic are

partitioned

together.

| Feature Name           | Radio Resource Partitioning   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4571                  |
| Value Package Name     | RAN Slicing                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0570                  |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node           |
| Access Type            | LTE                           |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                     |

Summary and Benefits

This

enhancement

enables

the operators to use the Radio Resource

Partitioning and the Elastic RAN features together

by

enabling the partitioning of remote and local traffic

together

on the eNodeB SCell. This

enables more eNodeB SCell candidates for

carrier aggregation in shared RAN configurations.

Capacity and Performance

The following PM counters can be used to observe

carrier aggregation feature

activity:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellEran
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran

The pmPrbDlUtilDistrPartitionN

counter can be used by the Ericsson

Network IQ Events

(ENIQ)

system to observe

RRP feature

activity.

Operation

This

enhancement

requires compatible

Radio

Resource Partitioning configuration

on the cells that are in carrier aggregation relation. This

means

identical partition assignment is required, but the sharing of assignments can be

arbitrary.

For each cell,

the observability of the resource use by

local and remote traffic for each partition is supported. To

enable

RRP

handling in Elastic RAN, the node

hosting

the ESCell

is partitioning the traffic from the

PCell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The neighboring eNodeBs in the Elastic RAN configuration must

be

on the same software version.

## Appendix A.f: 24.Q2.3: Radio Resource Partitioning Enhancement for Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation

This feature enhancement ensures that the Radio Resource Partitioning feature

correctly operates in ESCells that are in Elastic RAN carrier aggregation configuration and

that only have low load.

| Feature Name           | Radio Resource Partitioning   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4571                  |
| Value Package Name     | RAN Slicing                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0570                  |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node           |
| Access Type            | LTE                           |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                     |

Summary and Benefits

In a low-load situation, this feature enhancement ensures that the ESCell sends

scheduling information to the PCell according to its partition utilization and RRP

configuration. The PCell stores this information for each ESCell and for each

partition, and prioritizes ESCell scheduling based on the stored information.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on channel conditions and the RRP configuration of the UE, the change in

the scheduling sequence might affect the Average DL MAC Cell Throughput KPI in the

ESCell.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.
