# 1 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension Overview

The 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature supports the capability to transmit

downlink data to a UE on four carriers simultaneously.

Summary

The feature has the following benefits:

- The downlink speed is increased across the coverage area.
- A more efficient use of scattered spectrum makes it possible to combine up to four components of the LTE spectrum.
- The end-user experience is improved by achieving peak throughput based on the system configurations, and the number of component carriers and TX layers.

The 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature supports the band combination signaling

according to 3GPP TS 36.331 and 3GPP TS 36.101. The introduced

band combination signaling enables UEs supporting more than 128 band combinations to provide

all relevant band combinations to the eNodeB. The UE only reports carrier aggregation band

combinations for specific bands requested by the eNodeB. This replaces the reporting of all

the supported carrier aggregation band combinations.

By supporting a higher number of MIMO layers, a higher spectrum efficiency with higher peak

downlink throughput can be achieved.

The maximum number of MIMO layers that can be configured for the UE depends on the

following characteristics:

- Corresponding capacity and peak rate limitations of the eNodeB Baseband platform
- Corresponding capacity and peak rate limitations of the UE capabilities

The maximum number of supported MIMO layers is 16.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The UE must support 3GPP Release 13 or later.

To reach downlink peak throughput, the UE must also support the following:

To reach 16 MIMO layers, UE category 19 is required.

# 3 Feature Operation of 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

With carrier aggregation, a UE uses resources from multiple cells. With the 4CC DL

Carrier Aggregation Extension feature, the UE uses up to four

downlink

component carriers at the same time.

- The maximum TX layers that both the eNodeB and UE can support are reconfigured on each component carrier. If the maximum allowed TX layers are changed on a component carrier because another SCell is added or removed, they are reconfigured at the same time along with SCell reconfiguration.
- All three SCells are implicitly deconfigured upon release of the UE.
- All three SCells are deconfigured at incoming handover. However, the UE is configured with one or more SCells in the target cell, following the same procedure as at initial access.
- An SCell is deconfigured when the UE has poor coverage (indicated by A2 report) or there is a better SCell candidate in the same frequency (indicated by A6 report). Also, it is triggered separately for the first, second, and third SCell.
- An SCell is deconfigured at SCell change (A6) and an SCell candidate cell with stronger signal is configured as the new SCell. Also, it is triggered separately for the first, second, and third SCell.

Dynamic Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation

The SCell activation and deactivation triggers are the following:

- Need based: Activate and deactivate based on buffer occupancy.
- Coverage based: Deactivate based on poor SCell coverage.
- Aperiodic CQI report based: Deactivate the feature based on the lack of aperiodic CQI reporting from the SCell.
- Data-triggered deactivation condition is never satisfied if the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.dcSCellActDeactDataThres attribute or the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellActDeactDataThres attribute is -1. In this case, deactivation based on no SCell aperiodic reporting is possible to be increased.
- Prohibit timer to avoid ping-pong effect.
- SCell is deactivated as a result of cell lock or eMBMS start or stop.
- Up to two SCells are deactivated based on poor PCell uplink channel condition. To avoid deactivation of the third SCell, it is recommended to set the following values:
- Activation based on buffer occupancy triggers activation of one, two, or three SCells.
- Deactivation based on buffer occupancy triggers deactivation of one SCell at a time in one of the following instances: The SCell that provides the lowest potential throughput is deactivated. The SCell that is located at a different DU from PCell is deactivated.
- Potential throughput: Calculated based on bandwidth, number of code words and channel condition. These are only used for deactivation decision as CQI is only reported for activated SCells.

# 4 Network Impact of 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

The 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature allows up to three configured SCells

per UE, so the loading limit is reached by fewer UEs than previously, with 2CC, or

3CC.

Capacity and Performance

A UE configured with an SCell consumes more resources than a UE connected only to a PCell.

For each additional SCell configured, a new resource is allocated at the PCell. However, it

is counted as one from a connected UE license perspective. The more configured SCells mean

that fewer UEs reach the loading limit.

Existing mechanisms, with the right configuration, ensure that SCell configuration is

stopped before the loading limit is reached. By doing this, CA UEs are prevented from

blocking attachment of new UEs into the system. For more information, see Carrier Aggregation.

At additional SCell configuration during initial connection, connection reestablishment,

or incoming handover, the following impacts apply to UEs configured with carrier

aggregation:

- The number of RRC connection reconfiguration procedures increases when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.
- The size of the RrcConnectionReconfiguration and HandoverPreparationInformation messages and the time to complete the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure might increase when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION or ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION.

Additional resources are required on PUCCH for transmission of SCell DL HARQ ACKs. For more

information, see Control Channel Dimensioning.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature is applicable only for 3GPP Release 13 or later UEs. UEs of earlier releases

The feature improvement enables the 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension and 5CC DL Carrier

Aggregation Extension to reach a higher spectrum efficiency with a peak downlink

throughput of near 1.2 Gbps by using 12 MIMO layers.

The following limitations apply to 3/4/5 CC with 12 layers MIMO:

- System verification of performance has not been completed due to late availability of UE that supports 12 layers MIMO.
- IODT verification of 5CC with 12 layers MIMO has not been performed since commercial support for UE capable of 5CC with 12 layers MIMO is not available.

Capacity and Performance

The UE downlink throughput is expected to increase for UEs that are in very good channel

condition.
