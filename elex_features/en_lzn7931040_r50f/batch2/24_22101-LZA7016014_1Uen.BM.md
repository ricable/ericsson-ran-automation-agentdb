# 3 Included Functions

## 3.1 Automatic SCell Management Overview

The feature enables the automatic configuration of cells as SCells for carrier

aggregation on existing cell relations.

| Feature Name           | Automatic SCell Management                                                 |

| Value Package Name     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation                                               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0564                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature detects potential SCells based on hit rate. The detected cells are

configured as SCell candidates, so carrier aggregation features can include them in

SCell candidate lists. The feature can also configure SCells with low hit rate as

not suitable for carrier aggregation.

Hit rate is defined as the likelihood of a certain target cell to be qualified as

SCell for the UE in the PCell. To estimate the hit rate value for each cell

relation, periodic Report Strongest Cells measurements are performed by inactive UEs

connected to the PCell.

When the qualified periodic measurement report from the UE is received, the eNodeB

performs the following steps:

- It decreases the hit rate value of all cell relations on the measured frequency.
- It increases the hit rate value of the qualified cell relation reported as the strongest cell.

If the periodic measurement report is not qualified, the hit rate value decreases for

all cell relations on the measured frequency.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.3 Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering Overview

This feature enables downlink traffic steering to selected SCells for UEs configured

with carrier aggregation.

| Feature Name           | Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5237                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation                                               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0564                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature extends the carrier aggregation function of downlink transmission on

several carriers. With this feature, selected downlink traffic can be transmitted to

the UEs using only dedicated secondary cells (offloading SCells) as long as the

capacity of these carriers is below the configured steering threshold.

Without the feature, the carrier aggregation algorithm splits downlink data among all

active carriers. Therefore, the PCell is always considered for downlink transmission

to the UE. This feature reduces the use of the PCell, and increases the use of the

offloading SCells.

This feature supports downlink traffic steering from the PCell to SCells of any type.

Feature configuration is performed at node level and is applied for any PCell with

existing cell relations to offloading SCells that are configured for traffic

steering. Downlink traffic to be steered is configurable on QCI level.

The feature has the following benefits:

- The use of offloading SCells is increased to offload the PCell and other regular SCells.
- The use of downlink resources is reduced on the PCell. The released resources can be reused for other services.
- The peak throughput of the UE is not affected. If the capacity of the offloading SCells is not enough, other carriers are used in downlink transmission.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.4 Configurable SCell Priority Overview

selection in carrier aggregation. The feature introduces the following functions:

- Prioritization of carrier frequencies eligible for SCell selection
- Prioritization of SCells to be selected for carrier aggregation within a carrier frequency
- Distribution of the SCell utilization among the carrier frequencies

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

This feature allows for the limitation of the number of initially configured SCells.

configuration of additional SCells triggered by UE traffic conditions.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Optimized maintenance of the number of UEs served at the same time
- More balanced use of resources that are allocated for SCells
- Decreased number of measurement reports and decreased amount of signaling when limiting the number of initially configured SCells

This feature provides the most benefits to the following use cases:

- Mixed mode configurations for LTE and NR
- Networks with a high number of carrier aggregation-capable UEs
- Networks with a high number of component carriers

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.6 Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration Overview

| Value Package Name     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation                                               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0564                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature detects uplink-heavy UEs, and attempts to configure uplink carrier

aggregation for them by configuring up to one uplink SCell. As a result, increased

uplink throughput for such UEs can be expected.

The uplink component carriers or uplink SCells that might provide the best

performance can be prioritized.

The main benefit of the feature is improved uplink data rate for UEs. An extra

benefit is dynamic SCell selection for uplink carrier aggregation.

In addition, the feature provides a node-level  configuration option for quickly

transferring from uplink-preferred carrier aggregation to downlink-preferred carrier

aggregation configuration after the UE exits the uplink-heavy state.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Global SCell Evaluation feature evaluates all PCell and UE-relevant SCell

combinations. This results in an enhanced effective bandwidth evaluation function.

The evaluation function considers the following factors when determining SCell

combinations:

- Downlink and uplink bandwidth
- High-order modulation capability
- Whether the SCell is FDD, TDD, or LAA
- Uplink weight in the combination
- MIMO layers
- Configured SCell and frequency priorities when the Configurable SCell Priority feature is activated
- Cell load based on SCell credits

The feature has the following benefits:

- Suboptimal initial selection of SCell combinations is avoided through the introduction of global search over all supported band combinations.
- The UE throughput gain provided by carrier aggregation is improved. This is because of the better use of available resources for SCell data scheduling.
- The best potential throughput is provided for the UE by enhancing the Effective Bandwidth Evaluation function to consider more factors.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The purpose of the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is to enable downlink

carrier aggregation between cells not on the same eNodeB.
