# 3 Feature Operation of PSHO-Based Fallback to UTRAN

This feature initiates a blind handover or RwR to transfer UEs from LTE to UTRAN when a

CS fallback is triggered.

The blind handover is done to transfer UEs to the target cell on the highest prioritized

frequency. The highest prioritized frequency is configured in a CSFB priority list named as

List 1 in the Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection feature. If the blind handover is Not

Applicable, the eNodeB triggers a measurement and transfers the UE to the first cell of List

1. This allows handover in the measurement report received from UE.

The PSHO-Based Fallback to UTRAN feature can be improved by cooperating with the

Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection feature when a handover preparation fails. In these

cases, an alternative CSFB target list is configured as List 2 in the Measurement-Based CSFB

Target Selection feature, and this is used for the transfer.

Operation Process

When a CS fallback is triggered, the PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN feature transfers the

UE to a WCDMA frequency by handover. To avoid measurements, the blind handover is activated,

and measurements occur only if blind handover is not possible.

The UE is transferred by the CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature from LTE to the target

frequency if the following conditions are not met:

- The target frequency is a WCDMA frequency.
- The UE supports handover to the target frequency.
- The UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to HANDOVER.
- The frequency relation has at least one cell relation that can be used for handover. This is ensured with the value of the UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed and MobilityStatusIrat.available attributes set to TRUE.

Figure 1   PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN Flowchart

Process Steps for Blind Handover

1. If the following conditions are met, a blind handover is initiated to transfer the UE to a target frequency. For the blind handover, the target frequency with the highest priority in List 1 is selected.
    - The attribute EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed is set to TRUE.
    - There must be a cell with the attribute UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator set to COVERS.
2. After a target cell is selected, a handover preparation starts and the handover is executed. If the preparation fails, the RwR is applied to transfer the UE to the frequency which is selected in one of the following ways: If the preparation for blind handover fails, one of the highest prioritized frequencies in List 1 is selected. If the preparation for handover fails, the frequency in the measurement report from the UE is selected as the target frequency. At UE release, NACC information is included in the RRC connection release message, which can shorten call setup time in target RAT. This requires that NACC information is available for the target frequency, and one of the following conditions is met: UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT\_NACC. UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to HANDOVER.

Process Steps if Blind Handover Is Not Applicable

1. If the blind handover is not applicable, the UE starts a B1 or B2 measurement on the highest prioritized frequency selected in List 1. To do this, one of the following conditions must be met: Attribute UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive is set to TRUE. The feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is activated, and attribute UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN or UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN is set to TRUE. If the measurement cannot be started, the RwR is applied to transfer the UE to one of the highest prioritized frequencies in List 1.
2. A report from the UE is sent to the eNodeB, and a target cell is selected for the following situations: If UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to HANDOVER, the first cell in the report with UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute set to TRUE is selected as target for handover. If no cell in the report allows handover, the target frequency becomes the target for RwR. If UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT, the target frequency becomes the target for RwR. At UE release, NACC information is included in the RRC connection release message, which can shorten call setup time in target RAT. This requires that NACC information is available for the target frequency, and one of the following conditions is met: UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT\_NACC. UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to HANDOVER.
    1. If the A2 measurement report is received before the B1 measurement report, one of the highest prioritized frequencies in List 1 is selected as a target frequency to perform RwR.
    2. After a measurement report is received, the LAI reported by the UE is checked with registered LAI before proceeding with RwR. If the reported LAI is different than the registered LAI, the eNodeB ignores the report.
    3. If the measurement times out, one of the highest prioritized frequencies in List 1 is selected as a target frequency to perform RwR.

Operation Process When Both Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection and

PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN Features are Activated

Figure 2   Feature Operation with Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection and PSHO-Based

CS Fallback to UTRAN

When both Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection and PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN

features are activated, the features operate the same as if only PSHO-Based CS

Fallback to UTRAN is activated, except during the following cases:

- If the List 1 UeMeasControl.csfbHoTargetSearchTimer times out
- If the handover preparation fails, whether it is a blind handover or not

In both cases, the eNodeB redirects the UE to an alternative frequency selected from

the List 2.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN

## 9.1 Configuration of Shared RAN Mobility to WCDMA MOCN

The shared RAN mobility to WCDMA function must be enabled for UEs using additional

PLMNs in MOCN configurations.

Enabling Shared RAN mobility to WCDMA MOCN makes IRAT handover possible, where the UE

does not handle the primary PLMN of the WCDMA cell, only an additional PLMN.

This function can be enabled by setting the

ENodeBFunction.hoSrvccToWcdmaMocnEnabled attribute to

true. The function is disabled by default.

When the function is enabled, PSHO and SRVCC handover are allowed, if the target UTRAN

cell and the HRL of the UE both contain a PLMN which is included in the

UtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute.

If the UtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute is empty, PSHO and

SRVCC handover are allowed for UEs belonging to any PLMN.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q3: Improved CS Fallback Call Setup

Shortening CS fallback setup time and call setup time in target RAT.

| Feature Name:           | CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN  Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection  PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0856 R3  FAJ 121 3073 R3  FAJ 121 3072 R3                                                          |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                                                                                           |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R8                                                                                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node                                                                         |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                                                                                        |

The improvement gives the possibility to skip RRC messages before UE release when CS fallback

is started from RRC Idle mode, if no CS fallback measurements are

needed. It also enables that NACC information is included in the RRC connection release

message when the CS fallback measurement times out or when a CSFB-triggered handover

preparation fails. This can shorten call setup time in target RAT.

Capacity and Performance

With the improvement, CS fallback setup time can be shortened.
