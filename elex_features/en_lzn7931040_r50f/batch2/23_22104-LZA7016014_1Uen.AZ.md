Summary

The feature makes measurements on the reflected power to detect breaks in the RF feeder. It

can also detect other RF-related defects in the antenna system path connected to the

radio unit. The VSWR Over Threshold alarm is raised if return loss is

below the configured VSWR sensitivity value, or if cable disconnection at radio side

is detected.

The VSWR Antenna Supervision feature also can be configured to measure dual-band

radios.

# 3 Feature Operation of VSWR Antenna Supervision

The feature can be activated on downlink RF ports that transmit power. The feature only

applies to TX branches.

The feature uses RfPort MO attributes for

single band radio units, and FreqBandData MO attributes for multiband

radio units.

Without traffic, the feature can only measure return loss under the following conditions:

- The Air Interface Load Generator feature or the NR Air Interface Load Generator feature is activated.
- The output power is sufficient. Note: If the output power is insufficient, the VSWR Antenna Supervision feature might miss measurements.

Operational Process

1. Radio units report the average return loss with a natural variation called Coupler Directivity Error.
2. If return loss is below the configured sensitivity, the node pauses return loss measurements, and generates artificial load to increase the accuracy.
3. The node resumes return loss measurements to validate the previously measured values. Note: The validation process is only supported on cell level.
4. If return loss is below the configured sensitivity, the VSWR Over Threshold alarm is raised.

Supervision Sensitivity

VSWR Antenna Supervision sensitivity is calculated in the following ways, without

considering any other factors:

- Using the following equation: VSWR = (1+10^(-RL/20))/(1-10^(-RL/20)) RL Return Loss
- Using Table 2

Table 2   VSWR Calculation

|   VSWR Sensitivity(%) |   Return Loss Threshold (dB) |   VSWR |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|--------|
|                     0 |                          6   |   3    |
|                    10 |                          6.8 |   2.68 |
|                    20 |                          7.6 |   2.42 |
|                    30 |                          8.4 |   2.22 |
|                    40 |                          9.2 |   2.06 |
|                    50 |                         10   |   1.92 |
|                    60 |                         10.8 |   1.81 |
|                    70 |                         11.6 |   1.71 |
|                    80 |                         12.4 |   1.63 |
|                    90 |                         13.2 |   1.56 |
|                   100 |                         14   |   1.49 |

Users can rely on the VSWR Alarm Threshold Calculator for Non-GSM Nodes to

determine the desired supervision sensitivity. For more information, see Configure the Supervision Sensitivity.

Example 1

If the antenna system has a measured or calculated Return Loss of 14 dB (VSWR 1.5), the

calculator recommends setting a 50% limit. This ensures safe operation with a good balance

of correct detection of antenna system degradation and robustness to false alarms.

On-Demand Readout of Return Loss

When the radio unit supports VSWR, the node measures return loss continuously. Using

the get command on the vswrValue attribute

returns the following details:

- The latest return loss value
- The time stamp of the latest measurement

If the number of measurements is insufficient to guarantee the accuracy, the

attribute returns the Insufficient RL readings above Screening

Threshold warning.

The repeatability of measurements is a more accurate indicator than the absolute

values. On-demand readout is suitable for detecting the deterioration of the antenna

system over time.

## 3.1 Supervision Sensitivity for VSWR Antenna Supervision

Supervision sensitivity is specified as the value of the

vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute. Supervision sensitivity implies

different absolute dB values depending on the radio unit.

Table 3   Supervision Sensitivity for Macro Radio Units

| Sensitivity Range (dB)   | 6–14   |
|--------------------------|--------|
| Sensitivity Range (%)    | 1–100  |
| Default Sensitivity (dB) | 6      |
| Default Sensitivity (%)  | 1      |

Configuring the Supervision Sensitivity

For more information on calculating the desired supervision sensitivity, see Configure the Supervision Sensitivity.

# 4 Network Impact of VSWR Antenna Supervision

The feature indicates the traffic handling ability of the

cell.

Capacity and Performance

Faults in the antenna system can impact the cell, and the VSWR Antenna Supervision

feature can be used to indicate the ability of the cell to handle traffic.

When a VSWR fault is detected, and the return loss is below the configured threshold,

the cell status is reported as degraded, but the cell continues to process traffic

as usual.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for VSWR Antenna Supervision

units, and FreqBandData MO attributes for multiband radio

units.

FreqBandData PM counters for multiband radio

units.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for VSWR Antenna Supervision

The

feature

can

be enabled and disabled

using

the vswrSupervisionActive

attribute.

Enabling and Disabling Feature

The feature can be enabled and disabled using the

vswrSupervisionActive attribute in the MO corresponding to

the radio unit.

Table 5   Enabling the Feature

| Radio Unit Type        | Corresponding Attribute            | Value   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| Single band radio unit | RfPort.vswrSupervisionActive       | true    |
| Multiband radio unit   | FreqBandData.vswrSupervisionActive | true    |

To ensure that the VSWR Over Threshold Alarm is raised, the value of

the RfPort.administrativeState attribute must be set to

UNLOCKED.

Table 6   Disabling the Feature

| Radio Unit Type        | Corresponding Attribute            | Value   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| Single band radio unit | RfPort.vswrSupervisionActive       | false   |
| Multiband radio unit   | FreqBandData.vswrSupervisionActive | false   |

Alarm for Unsupported Radio Units and Ports

If the feature is not supported on the radio unit, the Feature Resource

Missing alarm is raised.

If the value of the vswrSupervisionActive attribute is set to

true on

the

RfPort=R

MO

instance,

the Feature Resource Missing alarm is raised with the RfPort

has no VSWR capability additional text.

Configuring the Supervision Sensitivity

Supervision sensitivity is configured using the

vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute in the MO corresponding

to the radio unit.

Users must consider the following factors when configuring the supervision

sensitivity:

- If the sensitivity is too high, false alarms might be raised.
- If the sensitivity is too low, the reflected power might become too low because of the attenuation.
