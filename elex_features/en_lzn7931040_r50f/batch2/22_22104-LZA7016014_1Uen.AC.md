Summary

The feature enhances the antenna system management capabilities. Instead of having to

visit the site, the operator can remotely upgrade the firmware on 3GPP and AISG v2

compliant antenna near units with Iuant interface.

# 2 Dependencies of Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices

The feature depends on other features and system configuration related to antenna near

unit support.

| TMA Support (FAJ 121 0498) | Prerequisite   | Depending on the configuration, the RET Support feature, the TMA Support feature, or both 								must be active before introducing the Firmware Download of Antenna 								Line Devices feature. |

Hardware

The antenna near unit with Iuant interface must be functional and correctly installed

in the antenna system in accordance with the requirements of the 3GPP Iuant

specifications.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The XML file containing the firmware must be available on a remote SFTP/FTP server or

on a local server (PC on site). When storing the XML file on a remote SFTP/FTP

server, the Configurations folder in the SMRS server in the

OSS is recommended.

# 3 Feature Operation of Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices

The feature allows the operator to remotely upgrade the firmware of antenna near

units with Iuant interface. To perform the upgrade, an XML file containing the firmware

needs to be downloaded.

The XML File Containing the Firmware

The ALD supplier is responsible for the creation of a compressed XML file that

contains the firmware to be downloaded to the antenna near unit. The XML

encapsulation is selected by the AISG standardization forum for vendor-specific

content distribution. It enables validation without format conversion. The end user

benefits from the simplification of the interaction between different vendors of

controllers and ALDs.

To ensure the robustness of the solution, template and examples for the XML

encapsulation file are provided in the XML Encapsulation for ALD Firmware

Download, 1/221 04-FGC 101 2152 document in the Ericsson Product

Catalog.

The XML file used for the distribution of vendor-specific content includes

compatibility information. The compatibility information allows the node to validate

the file and decide if the firmware can be downloaded to the installed unit.

The XML file is compressed and stored by the operator on a remote SFTP/FTP server or

on a local server (PC on site). When storing the XML file on a remote SFTP/FTP

server, the Configurations folder in the SMRS server in the

OSS is recommended. The Configurations folder is where other

site configuration files, for example SiteEquipment.xml, are

stored.

Operational Process

1. The operator initiates the firmware download on the antenna near unit by using the AntennaNearUnit.downloadSoftware action. The operator needs to provide the following information to download the XML file: Server Path Username Password
2. The node fetches the XML file from the remote server using SFTP/FTP.
3. The node extracts the XML file.
4. The node validates the XML file by checking the compatibility between the XML file and the antenna near unit.
5. The node extracts and stores the firmware in the local disk directory defined for this purpose.
6. The node upgrades the antenna near unit with the new firmware.
7. The antenna near unit restarts to ensure the unit runs on the latest firmware.

# 6 Performance of Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

The feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices

To initiate the firmware download on the antenna near unit, the operator needs to use

the AntennaNearUnit.downloadSoftware action.

## 8.1 Download Software and Firmware on Antenna Near Unit

The AntennaNearUnit.downloadSoftware action retrieves the Antenna

Near Unit software package from an FTP server and downloads the firmware file to the Antenna

Near Unit.

Steps

1. Execute the AntennaNearUnit.downloadSoftware(string server, string path, string userName, string password) action. The following parameters must be set: &lt;server&gt; The IP address or hostname of the FTP server. &lt;path&gt; The file path to the software on the FTP server. &lt;userName&gt; The username used to sign in to the FTP server. &lt;password&gt; The password used to sign in to the FTP server.

Results

The Antenna Near Unit restarts automatically when the installation of the download is

complete and it runs on the new firmware when the action is completed.
