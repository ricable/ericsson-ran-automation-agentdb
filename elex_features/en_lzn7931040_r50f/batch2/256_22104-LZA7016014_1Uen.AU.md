Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature can only be used in TDD systems.

Network Requirements

The UE must support 8-port Channel-State Information Reference Signal (CSI-RS)

transmission at feature activation.

# 3 Feature Operation of TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature operates by the UE

estimating CSI-RS symbols from eight antennas. Then, the eNodeB calculates the beamforming

weights on the antenna port or ports.

The TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature supports the following

characteristics:

- Configuration of a cell with eight TX antenna ports
- CSI-RS transmission
- TM9 with single and dual layer beamforming in PDSCH
- Two CRS ports with common channel beamforming

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram of TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance

Package

1. The UE estimates CSI based on CSI-RS symbols from eight antennas.
2. Based on the feedback from the UE, the eNodeB calculates the beamforming weights on antenna port 7, 8, or both.

Figure 2   CSI-RS Mapping on Antenna Ports

For the TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature, each of the eight

physical antennas transmits a unique CSI-RS, using antenna ports 15-22. The

recommended physical antenna is the dual polarization antenna configuration.

CSI-RS ports 15-18 map on antennas 0-3 that have the same polarization direction.

Ports 19-22 map on antennas 4-7 that have another polarization direction.

- Configuration for 8TX/8RX Radios in Combination with 8-Port Antenna Units in Manage Hardware Equipment
- Sectors with Eight Antenna Branches for the Same Band(s) subsection of Guidelines for Configuring Sectors with More than Two Antenna Branches in Building Blocks

# 4 Network Impact of TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The feature provides higher beamforming gain on the PCell and on the SCell. The coverage

also increases because of the beamforming gain, but peak throughput is reduced.

Capacity and Performance

The TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature provides higher

beamforming gain not only on the PCell, but also on the SCell. The throughput is

improved, compared to TM7 and TM8.

The TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature increases coverage due

to beamforming gain.

The CSI-RS and UE-specific RS overhead, defined in this feature, reduces the peak

throughput compared with the legacy MIMO modes, such as TM3. The legacy release-8

and release-9 UE throughput also decreases because of the CSI-RS and UE-specific RS

overhead.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature introduces the

EUtranCellTDD.csiRsConfigType8TxTDD parameter. The

EUtranCellTDD.transmissionMode parameter is affected by the

feature.
