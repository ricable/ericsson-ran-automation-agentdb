# 1 Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE Overview

The Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

feature provides opportunities for the UE to stop monitoring the PDCCH to reduce the battery

consumption.

Summary

The Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE feature allows the UE to stop monitoring the

PDCCH during certain reoccurring time periods. The saving in terms of battery time

depends on the individual device implementation, how the feature is configured and

on the type of traffic. Web-browsing type of traffic typically has more significant

saving potential than continuous download or voice type of traffic.

DRX/DTX can be applied both in RRC\_IDLE and in

RRC\_CONNECTED. The Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

feature is provided as a licensed feature and allows DRX for UE in

RRC\_CONNECTED mode.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The UE must use Feature Group Indicators (FGIs) to indicate proven support for DRX.

# 3 Feature Operation of Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

The Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

feature activates DRX in the optimal phase of the DRX cycle, after the UE successfully

reconfigures the RRC connection with the radio node.

The DRX cycle consist of the following phases:

- On Duration phase, when the UE is active.
- Opportunity for DRX phase, when the UE is inactive.

The active phase for the UE is defined as the sum of time when the UE monitors the PDCCH.

This consists partly of the sum of On Duration phases, as shown in Figure 1, but also all time when either of the

parameter timers of DrxProfile.drxInactivityTimer or

DrxProfile.drxRetransmissionTimer are running. It also includes

the time when the UE expects a contention resolution or an uplink grant, for either new

transmission or adaptive retransmission. For further information, see 3GPP TS 36.321.

Figure 1   DRX Cycle Principle

The capability of the UE is established as part of the initial context setup between the

MME and the eNodeB. The levels of UE capability for DRX are the following:

- No DRX support (FGI 5=0)
- Partial DRX support (FGI 5=1 and FGI 4=0, the UE supports only long cycles)
- Full DRX support (FGI 5=1 and FGI 4=1)

For more information about DRX capability levels, see 3GPP TS

36.331, FGI in Annex B.

Operational Process

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. During SRB 1 phase,the UE sends an RRC connection request to the RBS.
2. The RBS initiates the RRC connection setup.
3. The UE completes the RRC connection.
4. During DRB 1 phase, the RBS enquires DRX parameters and capability information from the UE.
5. The UE sends the information to the RBS.
6. The RBS initiates an RRC connection reconfiguration.
7. The UE completes the RRC connection reconfiguration.
8. The feature activates DRX during the Initial Context Setup procedure, see Radio Bearer Service. Note: The S1AP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message received from MME includes the required UE capabilities.

The operation sequence takes place during the first DRB setup. The eNodeB only

schedules the UE during periods of active time.

Handover Behavior

DRX is a cell based feature. During handover (HO), the Handover Request

Acknowledge message from the target eNodeB provides DRX setting

information to the source eNodeB, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Handover with DRX

DRX Aware RLC ARQ

When doing handover or TTI bundling activation, DRX Aware RLC ARQ shortens the value

of tPollretransmitTimer, to find transmission opportunities given

by DRX. DRX Aware RLC ARQ updates tPollretransmitTimer, if all of

the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The enableDrxAwareRlcArq is true.
- The longDrxCycle value is less than the tPollretransmitTimer value.
- The value of DrxProfile.drxInactivityTimer is less than 10 ms, that is from PSF1 to PSF8.
- The value of DrxProfile.onDurationTimer is less than 10 ms, that is from PSF1 to PSF8.

In this case tPollretransmitTimer is updated to

maxHARQTx(Qci) * HARQ-INTERVAL + harqOffset.

# 4 Network Impact of Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

The Efficient DRX/DTX

for Connected UE feature has possible impact on capacity and mobility.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on DRX configuration, the Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE feature has a

possible impact on network capacity, such as UE throughput. The feature also has a

possible impact on mobility, such as Handover Success Rate. An increase in UE

battery saving by increasing the length of the DRX cycles results in an increase in

Downlink Latency and performance degradation. This performance degradation must be

balanced in the best way by the configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

The Efficient DRX/DTX for

Connected UE feature introduces new MOM attributes for configuring the DRX

cycle.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter(1)                      | Type       | Description          |
|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.drxActive           | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| EUtranCellTDD.drxActive           | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.onDurationTimer        | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.drxInactivityTimer     | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.drxRetransmissionTimer | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.longDrxCycle           | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.longDrxCycleOnly       | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.shortDrxCycle          | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| DrxProfile.shortDrxCycleTimer     | Introduced | See MOM description. |

(1)

The DRX parameter default values in the MOM provide a DRX

configuration that is a good compromise between maximal UE

battery saving and minimal impact on system performance. To

achieve the best possible compromise between UE battery

saving and feature impact, a balanced DRX parameter

configuration must be made by the operator, in accordance

with the current system and traffic situation. Faulty

settings of DRX parameters (also hidden parameters) can

result in a DRX-unsynchronized state with an increased risk

of negative impact on retainability.

# 6 Performance of Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

Performance of the Efficient DRX/DTX

for Connected UE can be observed using counters related to DRX cycle length and latency

length.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators, but has a possible impact

on some KPIs, such as Downlink Latency, Mobility Success Rate and UE Throughput. The

KPI impact depends on current conditions, such as configuration, individual device

implementation, system and traffic types.
