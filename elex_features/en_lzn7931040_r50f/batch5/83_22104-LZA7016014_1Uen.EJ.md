Summary

Inter-frequency load balancing enables the efficient use of network resources on

multiple carrier frequencies, and achieves similar user experience independent of

the carrier in use. Load balancing is achieved by relocating the UE in connected

mode to carriers that are underused compared to the carrier in use.

This feature introduces a method to assess traffic load. The method is based on the

presence of E-RABs in the cell and the QoS class to which they belong.

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is realized as a network feature.

Neighboring nodes cooperate and perform the traffic load adjustments without a

central node controlling those efforts.

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature can be inter-mode (FDD and TDD) if the

Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover feature is activated.

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature supports the following functionalities:

- An arbitrary grade of coverage overlap between cells
- An arbitrary number of target cells on the same inter-frequency
- An arbitrary number of frequencies and frequency bands
- Load balancing between cells that are co-located and not co-located
- Load balancing between cells in the same and in separate nodes

Figure 1   Traffic Moving between Inter-Frequency Cells Covering a Common Geographical

Area Due to Load Balancing

To support load balancing between cells in separate nodes, the feature requires an

Ericsson node in both ends.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Radio traffic load is distributed between inter-frequency cells with overlapping coverage. For example, lower carrier frequencies can have better coverage and propagation characteristics and attract more traffic than higher frequencies. This can result in the underuse of high frequency carriers. The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature distributes radio use evenly over all carriers, which maximizes the availability of radio resources.

- The non-GBR end user experience is enhanced.
- The risk of blocking is reduced, allowing more UEs in an area where multiple carrier frequencies are used.
- The average user throughput increases linearly when adding new carrier frequencies or increasing the RF spectrum by other means.
- The observability of the traffic load in the network increases on a per-cell basis using a subscription ratio.

When uplink-heavy UE detection and                                     exclusion are active in a cell, the UE might be moved to a                                     neighbor cell before it is identified as uplink-heavy. If it is                                     detected as uplink-heavy in the serving cell it was moved to, it                                     might be immediately moved back to the source cell. After the                                     last handover, the UE is identified as uplink-heavy and is not                                     chosen for further load-balancing actions as long as it is                                     marked as uplink-heavy.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The Idle Mode Support feature                                     enables the UE in idle mode to access the network and be reached                                     from the network within acceptable delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Inter-Frequency Offload (FAJ 121                                     3061)                                   | Related        | The purpose of this feature is to off-load traffic load above an                                     off-load threshold from an E-UTRAN cell to an Ericsson or                                     non-Ericsson E-UTRAN FDD or TDD cell.  This feature uses the method introduced by Inter-frequency Load                                     Balancing for the assessment of traffic load, based on the                                     presence of E-RAB, in the cell and the QoS class to which they                                     belong.  This is an alternative feature to IFLB. The main difference to                                     IFLB is that there is no load information exchange between the                                     cells in Inter-Frequency Offload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Throughput-aware UE selection estimates and compares possible UE                                     throughput in the cell before using a UE for load balancing. A                                     decision on whether to move the UE or not is based on the                                     throughput difference.   When uplink-heavy UE detection and exclusion are active in a                                     cell, the UE might be moved to a neighbor cell before it is                                     identified as uplink-heavy.

EPC Feature Dependencies

Packet Core Network-controlled RAN Load Balancing based on Mobility-Based Policy and

RAN feature Inter-Frequency Load Balancing may have interoperability issues. This

can cause unwanted behavior in the RAN or Packet Core Network, or both. See

Mobility-Based Policy in the SGSN-MME CPI documentation for more

information.

## 2.1 Compatibility of Load Balancing and Automatic Access Barring

During ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, inter-frequency

load balancing for incoming handover is disabled in the cell.

When automatic access class barring is used together with Inter-Frequency Load Balancing,

the incoming handover to an overloaded cell is disabled.

Inter-frequency load balancing is enabled in the cell when the barring probability

reaches 0.

If load balancing during access class barring is enabled, that is

EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true, the

following events occur:

- The subscription ratio measurements are still ongoing in the cell when the automatic access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered.
- The function enables the cell for outgoing load balancing handover, and a faster recovery from overload.
- Triggering of the access class barring calculation mechanism does not disable subscription ratio evaluation and Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, by setting

the PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute to

true, and the cell is configured as

priority cell, triggering of the access class barring calculation

mechanism does not disable the following events:

- Subscription ratio evaluation
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload

A cell is configured as priority cell if the following is true:

- PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY.
- The EUtranCellFDD.ptmCellProfileRef or the EUtranCellTDD.ptmCellProfileRef reference to a cell profile is set as priority.

Example 1   Automatic Access Class Barring Disables

Load Balancing

Figure 2   Inter-Frequency Load Management Disabled by Automatic Access Barring

The following events occur during the access class barring calculation

mechanism:

1. Before t1, inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled.
2. At t1, these load balancing functions are disabled, and automatic access class barring calculation is enabled.
3. Between t1 and t4, until the automatic access class barring calculation is enabled, the load balancing functions remain disabled.
4. At t4, the barring probability reaches its minimum value, that is 0. Inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled again.
5. Between t5 and t6, inter-frequency load balancing is disabled again.
6. Between t6 and t7, outgoing inter-frequency load balancing is enabled only if EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true.
7. At t7, the barring probability reaches its minimum value again. Inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload are enabled again.

## 2.2 Compatibility of Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and Virtual Sectors

In the following cases there are compatibility issues between features Inter-Frequency

Load Balancing and Virtual Sectors:

- When Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is activated after Virtual Sectors, the SCell candidate relations must be set to the overlapping virtual sectors.
- When Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is activated before Virtual Sectors, Inter-Frequency Load Balancing cannot work. However the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing configuration between these virtual sectors can be kept. Turn off the license for Virtual Sectors to use Inter-Frequency Load Balancing again.
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing cannot work between virtual sectors. However Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is still possible between a virtual sector and a normal sector.

There are three carriers per radio. One carrier (f3) covers the full physical

sector and the other two carriers (f1 and f2) cover the virtual sectors.

Figure 3   Compatible Configuration for Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is a continuous process that tries to balance

the traffic load between carrier frequencies. Load balancing relations are configured

between overlapping inter-frequency cells. The cells communicate information about

traffic load and use it to regulate the load balancing algorithm. This allows the

feature to operate autonomously in each cell without a central node. This is beneficial

to the scalability of the feature.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 4   Load Balancing Operation

Process Steps

1. The traffic load in a cell is assessed repeatedly in certain intervals of a load balancing cycle. The current subscription ratio of the cell is calculated. The QCI subscription quanta values (QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta and QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta) of all E-RABs (both GBR and non-GBR services) present in the cell are added. The sum is divided by the cell subscription capacity that is the value of EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attributes. The subscription ratio is input to the load information exchange and used to determine further load balancing actions in the cell.
2. Cell load information is exchanged between cells. Each cell can receive load reports from one or more other cells in the same node or in a remote node. The exchange of load information only takes place if load balancing is configured between the related cells. Load information exchange between cells in remote nodes is performed over X2 private messages, in an asynchronous process. Information exchange is only possible between Ericsson nodes. Figure 5 Load Information Exchange between Nodes The selection of target cells is controlled with parameter EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing.
3. Based on the load information received from other cells, each source cell determines the traffic load that is to be handed over to each target cell to balance the load differences. This is done based on the following: If multiple target cells exist, the total offload is split between these cells. Normally, load balancing targets equal subscription ratios in the source and target cells. However, when traffic is low, load balancing can allow rate offset. The rate offset is pronounced at very low subscription ratios and gradually decreases as traffic grows. The rate offset is removed at a subscription ratio of LoadBalancingFunction.lbRateOffsetLoadThreshold or higher, where load balancing targets equal subscription ratio.
    - Load difference to each target cell
    - Minimum load difference to trigger load balancing action, set by LoadBalancingFunction.lbThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG
    - Total offload from the source cell
    - Maximum load difference, LoadBalancingFunction.lbCeiling, taken into account in one round of load-balancing action
4. UEs that are suitable for offload are selected. When uplink-heavy UE detection for the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is configured and a UE is marked as uplink-heavy, it is excluded from load-balancing mobility actions. For more information, see Uplink-Heavy UE Detection. In the UE selection process, the UEs perform inter-frequency A5 measurements on the target frequency. This ensures that the UE has acceptable coverage in a target cell. Only those UEs are selected which support the target frequency band and trigger an A5 measurement report on the target cell. Note: The A5 measurement also enables load balancing actions for UEs that are configured for Carrier Aggregation. The maximum number of measurements started for load balancing purposes during a 15-second load balancing cycle is limited. Note: A UE in connected mode is selected to perform a measurement on a target frequency for load balancing purposes at most once for each load balancing cycle.
5. The execution of load balancing actions is performed by handover of the selected UEs to the target cells. The handover of UEs is performed using the following normal inter-frequency handover procedures: X2 Handover Preparation S1 Handover Preparation RRC Connection Reconfiguration Handover to a target cell is inhibited in the following cases: The EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute for the target cell is set to FALSE. The cell is listed as forbidden in a HRL provided for the UE. For more information on the support of HRL, see Shared LTE RAN. The RFPM function of the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is used. The FreqPrioEUTRA.loadBalancingAllowed attribute related to the RATFreqPrio MO for the target carrier frequency is set to FALSE for matching UE SPID.Note: If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is used, to inhibit inter-frequency offload for load balancing relations is inhibited. It can be achieved by setting the EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute to IFO\_AND\_IFLB, and the FreqPrioEUTRA.offloadAllowed attribute must also be set to FALSE. Otherwise, if the FreqPrioEUTRA.loadBalancingAllowed attribute is set to TRUE or there is no matching UE SPID, load balancing to the target cell for the UE is allowed. For more information on the support of SPID use, see Subscriber Triggered Mobility. If the solution Preferential Traffic Management is enabled and appropriate configuration is set, the following applies:A UE in connected mode is selected to perform a measurement on a target frequency for load balancing purposes at most once for each load balancing cycle. Inter-frequency load balancing can be stopped for some cells-to priority cells with high traffic load from non-priority cells. This allows the priority band to be used primarily to serve priority users, and ensures access for priority UEs in high traffic load situations. For more information, see Preferential Traffic Management Guidelines.

## 3.1 Load Balancing Cycle

The load balancing cycle is the time interval between two successive evaluations of

traffic load balancing status. It is  the time frame for the actions attempting to restore

the traffic load balance.

Load balancing between cells is done repeatedly in successive load balancing cycles of 15

seconds.

Some suitable UEs are moved to detected target cells by inter-frequency                         handover. |

## 3.2 Load Balancing Relation

The load balancing relation is the logical relation between a load balancing source

and a target cell. Load balancing relations are controlled with the

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute.

For load balancing features to steer traffic from one source cell to a target cell, a

relation must be defined in the source cell. This relation is defined to the target cell

using the EUtranCellRelation MO. The

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute controls whether load

balancing, or offload, or both are allowed.

## 3.3 User Experience Dependency on Traffic Load

The influence of traffic load on the user experience is different for GBR services with

guaranteed performance and non-GBR services of best effort type.

Figure 7   Influence of Number of Users on User Experience for GBR and Non-GBR Services

The user experience of a GBR service is essentially unaffected by an increase of traffic

load. This is up to the point where LTE RAN is unable to grant additional users into the

network. Above that point, LTE RAN may deny access and the user experience drops rapidly for

users with difficulties to gain access.

The user experience of non-GBR services gradually decreases by an increase of traffic load.

The grade of service is characterized by qualities like achievable bit rate and packet delay.

The achievable bit rate for the individual user decreases and packet delay tends to increase.

This is because shared transmission resources are used in LTE RAN with an increasing traffic

load.

The LTE RAN provides both GBR and non-GBR services. Of the total transmission resource in the

network a certain amount is employed to satisfy the GBR services. This reduces the resources

available for non-GBR services. Therefore, the number of both GBR and non-GBR users affects

the non-GBR user experience. The GBR user experience, on the other hand, is to a high degree

unaffected by the number of non-GBR users.

## 3.4 GBR Traffic Load

GBR traffic is characterized by a relatively persistent E-RAB that generates a steady data

stream. For example, an E-RAB for a voice call typically lasts for one or a few minutes.

During the voice call, a stream of voice packets is transferred at a nearly constant rate.

Therefore, the number of E-RABs for GBR traffic present in a cell is a good basis for the

assessment of the GBR traffic load.

## 3.5 Non-GBR Traffic Load

Non-GBR traffic is typically characterized by short but frequent data transactions. The

individual data transactions can range from a few data packets to the transfer of large files.

Many data transactions are completed within a short time, often less than a few seconds.

Non-GBR traffic has the following pattern:

1. The UE enters connected mode.
2. The E-RABs are established.
3. The data transaction, or a sequence of data transactions proceeds.
4. The UE is released after a period of inactivity.

This pattern is repeated, but each RRC connection and each E-RAB for the node is unique. The

node is unable to correlate the different RRC connections generated by a UE.

Non-GBR traffic patterns are difficult to predict because they change often and quickly. The

activity of an individual UE or E-RAB does not necessarily give much information about the

activity a few seconds ahead. The number of E-RABs presented by the UEs to the LTE RAN can be

used to assess the non-GBR traffic load generated by the UE groups. This applies for a UE

group camped in a cell.

## 3.6 Subscription Ratio

Subscription ratio is a relative traffic load measure. It is the ratio between the

total QCI subscription quanta of all E-RAB instances currently configured in a cell and the

cell subscription capacity of the cell.

It takes a value between zero and one for an under-subscribed cell. Values greater than

one indicate an over-subscribed cell.

Figure 8   Subscription Ratio

The configuration of the following values has to obtain the required load balancing

behavior:

- qciSubscriptionQuanta (in MOs QciProfilePredefined or QciProfileOperatorDefined)
- cellSubscriptionCapacity (in MOs EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD)

This enables load balancing between cells with different UE groups, and cells with

different traffic capacities.

Configuration of the assessment model offers control of the load balancing objectives in

LTE RAN and opportunity for further changes.

The subscription ratio can be used to monitor the traffic load in a cell.

## 3.7 Cell Subscription Capacity

Cell subscription capacity is the nominal traffic handling capacity of a cell. Its value

is an estimate of the total amount of QCI subscription quanta values the cell is

expected to accommodate at full system load. Cell subscription capacity defines the

target for load balancing to divide the traffic load between overlaid cells within the

network. It can be configured with one of the following MOM attribute:

- EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity

## 3.8 QCI Subscription Quanta

QCI subscription quanta is the representation of the anticipated or typical traffic

handling capacity required for an E-RAB with certain QCI.

QCI subscription quanta is configured for a QoS class by setting the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute.

## 3.9 Rate Offset

Rate offset is traffic load balancing offset, shifting the traffic load with a bias

towards cells with high traffic handling capacity. This offers anticipated better

performance during periods of low traffic.

Normally, load balancing targets equal subscription ratios in the source and target

cells. However, when traffic is low, load balancing can allow higher subscription ratios

in high capacity cells, as those provide better user performance in sparsely loaded LTE

RAN. The effect is called rate offset. The rate offset is pronounced at very low

subscription ratios and gradually decreases as traffic grows. The rate offset is

completely removed at a subscription ratio of

LoadBalancingFunction.lbRateOffsetLoadThreshold and higher, where

load balancing targets equal subscription ratio.

## 3.10 Load Management and MP Load Control

The objective for the load management functions in the eNodeB is to balance or offload load

when possible. However, the focus is on the air interface load. During the execution of load

management functions the MP processor load may increase. To not affect general traffic

handling, the load management functions are temporarily paused if the MP load control state is

higher than NOT HIGH. For more information, see Basic Load Management.

## 3.11 Sticky Carrier

The Sticky Carrier configuration is used to confine UEs in idle mode to the carrier frequency

of the current serving cell. This is suitable in a network deployment where good coverage can

be expected across large areas on two or more carrier frequencies.

The technique is shown in Table 3. It takes

advantage of the CRPs of the carrier frequencies. The CRP settings are included in the System

Information Broadcast in each cell. In the Sticky Carrier configuration, the CRP of the

serving carrier frequency is set higher than the CRP of the other carrier frequencies used in

the network.

In this way, a UE in idle mode is confined to the carrier frequency of the current serving

cell. This is beneficial because the UE tends to remain on the carrier frequency where it is

released to idle mode. The effect of load balancing actions in connected mode may then sustain

periods in idle mode. The effect remains the next time the UE connects to the network. It

reduces the need for load balancing action to compensate for idle mode mobility between the

carrier frequencies.

## 3.12 Priority Carrier

The Priority Carrier configuration is used to direct UEs in idle mode to a particular carrier

frequency. It is suitable for deployment in networks where the cells on one or more carrier

frequencies are small and do not provide continuous coverage. In those cells, UE camping

frequently runs into poor coverage. As a result, UEs are required to reselect cells on other

carrier frequencies. This configuration supports the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature to

find a sufficient number of UEs in connected mode suitable for relocation back to the priority

carrier cells. Using the idle mode mobility to bias the UE population towards the priority

carrier can then be a useful complement.

The technique of Priority Carrier is shown in Table 4. The carrier frequency C is configured as the

priority carrier, whereas a sticky carrier configuration is applied between carrier

frequencies A and B. Strictly higher CRP is configured for C, the priority carrier frequency,

compared with A and B, the other carrier frequencies.

UEs in idle mode are directed to the priority carrier cells when entering their coverage. The

Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature then has an easier task to find suitable UEs in

connected mode for load balancing action towards those cells. This can be beneficial, in

particular if the priority carrier cells only cover a small number of the UEs on the other

carrier frequencies.

## 3.13 Uplink-Heavy UE Detection

When uplink-heavy UE detection for the feature is configured, the UE selection process

improves for load-balancing mobility actions. The feature excludes UEs from

load-balancing mobility actions if they are marked as uplink-heavy. The uplink-heavy UE

detection mechanism is applied to all UEs that connect to the LTE cell.

The information about the uplink-heavy state of the UE is stored in the UE context.

# 4 Network Impact of Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

Capacity and Performance

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature adjusts uneven distribution of traffic

load between carrier frequencies. The ability to fully use the traffic capacity on

all the available carrier frequencies is improved. The feature is beneficial for the

system throughput and the number of UEs and E-RABs the LTE RAN is able to handle. It

allows the system capacity to increase proportionally when new carrier frequencies

are added and the available RF spectrum thereby increases.

The feature relies on UE inter-frequency measurements to identify UEs suitable for

load balancing action. The RRC signaling associated with inter-frequency

measurements and the handover-related signaling may increase. At steady state, when

traffic load is nearly in balance, the increase is small compared with other

signaling of similar kind.

Mobility

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature redistributes users in connected mode

between inter-frequency cells by means of traffic load triggered inter-frequency

handover. The number of inter-frequency handover increases with this feature. The

handover is typically performed in good radio conditions.

The outgoing handover cause code value for the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature

is set depending on the value of the attributes LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1SourceTriggersOffload and

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeX2SourceTriggersOffload for

S1 and X2 handovers respectively. It is important that Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing and Inter-Frequency Offload use different cause codes. Therefore the

selected cause code for Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is set by the node depending

on the value of the parameters.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

For information on configuration, click on the attribute.

## 9.1 Configuration of Load Balancing Relation

Load balancing relations are configured in the source cell towards each target cell, by

setting the EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute.

Table 10   Configuration of Load Balancing Relation

The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute can be configured in one

direction, from the source cell to the target cell.

To apply the same configuration in both directions between two cells,

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing must be set to the same value in both

directions. This allows both cells to act as source cells to each other.

The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute also controls the exchange

of load information. When set to ALLOWED or

IFO\_AND\_IFLB, the source cell requests the target cell to provide

traffic load reports.

Other mobility functionality is not affected by the

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute.

The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute can be determined and

configured automatically by the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature.

## 9.2 Configuration of Subscription Parameters

The operation of the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature requires that QCI subscription

quanta and cell subscription capacity are configured. QCI subscription quanta can be the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute. The cell

subscription capacity can be the EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute.

Configuration of QCI Subscription Quanta

The QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attributes are

configured in proportion to the typical traffic load an E-RAB of the specific QoS

class         represents in LTE RAN at high load. The general recommendation is to choose values for these

attributes in proportion to the expected downlink bit rates (in kbps) under those

conditions.

For a GBR type of E-RAB, the qciSubscriptionQuanta parameter is chosen

in proportion to the typical guaranteed downlink bit rate (in kbps) for the particular

QCI.

Table 11   Recommendations to Configure qciSubscriptionQuanta for GBR E-RABs

| QCI                      | Recommendation                                       |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 (conversational voice) | The value depends on the typical voice codec in use. |
| Other (2..4, …)          | The value depends on the type of streaming media.    |

For a non-GBR type of E-RAB, the qciSubscriptionQuanta parameter is

chosen in proportion to what is considered an acceptable downlink bit rate (in kbps) for a

UE in connected mode in LTE RAN at high load.

Table 12   Recommendations to Configure qciSubscriptionQuanta for Non-GBR E-RABs

The default E-RAB can be distinguished on different QCIs for users of separate categories,

for example, for users with different types of UE devices. It offers a way to differentiate

the qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute values among users of different

categories. This can be useful if there are user categories with widely different QoS

demand.

Configuration of Cell Subscription Capacity

At high load in LTE RAN, the cellSubscriptionCapacity (in MOs

EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD) is configured in

proportion to the achievable traffic capacity in the cell.

The achievable traffic capacity is typically proportional to the RF bandwidth of the cell,

but can also depend on other factors, including the following:

- Inter-site distances and the presence of radio interference from neighbor cells.
- How the cell antenna is configured. For example, whether MIMO is applied.
- How the UE group in the cell is distributed between the cell center and the cell edge.

It is recommended to choose a value of the attribute

cellSubscriptionCapacity in proportion to the achievable downlink bit

rate (in kbps) in the cell, considering the factors affecting the capacity. In a typical LTE

RAN deployment, without advanced antenna configurations, the achievable spectrum efficiency

at high load is usually in the proximity of 2 Mbit/MHz (bit rate for each RF bandwidth).

The amount of E-RABs the cell can accommodate is ultimately a trade-off with respect to the

achievable QoS level. Increasing the amount of E-RABs has the following effects:

- Reduced throughput and increased packet delay for individual (non-GBR) E-RABs
- Increased subscription ratio, with a given configuration of the qciSubscriptionQuanta and cellSubscriptionCapacity attributes
- Declined user experience, yet a still operable cell

Therefore, the subscription ratio can be used as an indicator of the user experience in the

cell.

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature can handle load balancing also at subscription

ratio levels greater than 1.0 (normally conceived as a mark of high load). The upper limit

of the subscription ratio is 16. If the upper limit is reached, the load balancing can

stall, because traffic load differences between cells above the limit are not perceptible.

The value of the cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute should be chosen

large enough to keep a margin with respect to this limitation.

## 9.3 Tuning of Subscription Parameters

In addition to the basic recommendations to configure load balancing, further tuning of the

QCI subscription quanta and cell subscription capacity is possible to improve the load

balancing behavior.

The QCI subscription quanta can be the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta MO attribute. The cell

subscription capacity can be the EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity MO attribute.

For example, if a high E-RAB density of certain QoS class tends to cause the QoS level to

decline. Then an increase of the corresponding qciSubscriptionQuanta

attribute can help to reduce the number of UEs in the cells where that type of E-RAB is

frequent.

The load balancing process does not consider the absolute level of

qciSubscriptionQuanta and cellSubscriptionCapacity.

The relations are important between these parameters.

The relations between qciSubscriptionQuanta values for different QCIs

determine how UEs with different E-RAB configuration can be exchanged in the load balancing

process.

Increasing the qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute value for one QoS

class         tends to relocate UEs from cells with high density of this type of E-RAB to cells with lower

density. The opposite is also true.

![Image](../images/83_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.EJ/additional_3_CP.png)

The relations between the cellSubscriptionCapacity values of different

cells determine how the UE group is divided between cells where load balancing is

allowed.

Increasing the value of the cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute for one

cell attracts UEs to that cell. The opposite is also true.

qciSubscriptionQuanta attributes determines the absolute level of the

subscription ratio in the cell.

Increasing the overall ratio between the values of attributes

cellSubscriptionCapacity and qciSubscriptionQuanta

requires a higher number of UEs in the cell to reach the same subscription ratio.

## 9.4 Configuration of Load Balancing Action on Node Level

The load balancing sensitivity and the maximum rate of load balancing actions are

configured with parameters LoadBalancingFunction.lbThreshold and LoadBalancingFunction.lbCeiling. These attributes are

defined at node level and apply to all load balancing relations within the node and

towards target cells in other nodes. In many deployments, the default values of these

attributes can be used.

Increasing the value of lbThreshold can reduce the rate of load

balancing actions back and forth between cells as a result of random variations of the

traffic load up and down. However, a certain degree of UE shuffling between the cells

can be useful, as it reduces the risk of UE segregation due to differences in traffic

behavior.

An increase of the value of lbThreshold can also increase the

burstiness of load balancing actions. This means that load balancing occurs all at once

rather than as a sequence of small steps.

Reducing the value of lbCeiling can help to distribute a sudden large

amount of load balancing actions over a period of time. However, care is required to

ensure that lbCeiling is configured large enough to outbalance any

systematic drift in the load balance. For example, due to poor coverage-triggered

mobility or due to mobility between neighbor cells on particular carrier

frequencies.

Attribute lbThreshold can be configured greater than attribute

lbCeiling. The effect can be that the load gap between the cells

is not entirely closed.

## 9.5 Configuration of Measurements for UE Selection for Load Balancing Action

Inter-frequency A5 measurement reporting in the UE selection for load balancing

action is configured for each source cell using the following attributes:

- ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold1Rsrp
- ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold2Rsrp
- ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.hysteresisA5

For inter-frequency A5 measurement reporting,

ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.lbA5Thr1RsrpFreqOffset can be

applied to a5Threshold1Rsrp to support a flexible

a5Threshold1Rsrp between frequency relations.

To ensure that the UE can stay in the target cell after a load balancing action,

configure a5Threshold2Rsrp attribute with a value higher than the A2

measurement threshold in the target cell. If QCI-dependent thresholds are applied in the

target cell, parameter a5Threshold2Rsrp must be configured with a

value higher than the maximum of these thresholds. The documents Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity and

Service Triggered Mobility describe the configuration of

poor coverage thresholds.

Attribute ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold1Rsrp can be used to

exclude UEs in a good radio environment from load balancing.

Attribute ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold1Rsrp can also be

used in a priority carrier configuration.

Attribute ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold2Rsrq is configured

for the source cell. It is used to set the RSRQ threshold for the target cell. The

reporting quantity for Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is set to RSRP, so the RSRQ check

is made at reception of an A5 measurement report. The load balancing action is

ended if the reported RSRQ falls lower than the threshold.

QCI-dependent UE selection criteria can be configured for the individual E-UTRAN

frequencies if the Service Specific Load Management feature is activated. For more

information, see Service Specific Load Management.

## 9.6 Configuration of Rate Offset for Load Balancing

Attributes LoadBalancingFunction.lbRateOffsetCoefficient and

LoadBalancingFunction.lbRateOffsetLoadThreshold are used to

configure the rate offset mechanism for load balancing.

Attribute lbRateOffsetCoefficient controls the impact of the rate

offset mechanism. The higher the value, the more biased load balancing is towards high

capacity cells at low load. To switch off the rate offset mechanism, attribute

lbRateOffsetCoefficient must be set to value 0. Otherwise, it is

recommended to use the default value.

Attribute lbRateOffsetLoadThreshold controls up to which subscription

ratio the rate offset is to have effect. The effect gradually decreases as the average

subscription ratio increases and disappears at an average subscription ratio of

lbRateOffsetLoadThreshold. The default value corresponds to an

average subscription ratio of 0.5 and it is not recommended to go below this value.

## 9.7 Idle Mode Mobility Aspects for Inter-Frequency Load Balancing Configuration

When the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is used, consideration of the UE mobility in

idle mode is recommended. The load balancing can be improved by appropriate configuration of

the UE idle mode mobility. The appropriate configuration depends on the type of network

deployment and cell topology.

Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency

Session Continuity and Idle Mode Support provide additional information regarding the configuration of idle

mode mobility.

### 9.7.1 Configuration of threshServingLow and threshXLow in Sticky Carrier or Priority Carrier Configuration

The recommendations to configure thresholds threshServingLow and

threshXLow are the same for a cell deployment where the sticky

carrier configuration is used and where priority carrier configuration is applied.

threshServingLow

Attribute threshServingLow

(EUtranCellFDD.threshServingLow or

EUtranCellTDD.threshServingLow) is used to set a threshold

for the inter-frequency cell reselection at poor coverage. The recommendation is to

configure threshServingLow attribute at the same level as the A2

measurement threshold in the cell. A2 measurement threshold configuration is

described in document Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session

ContinuityIdle Mode Support describes the configuration and

function of idle mode mobility..

The sNonIntraSearch attribute in struct SIB3

for the E-UTRAN cell needs to be set to a value greater than or equal to

threshServingLow attribute. In this case, the idle mode

inter-frequency mobility operates sufficiently towards carrier frequencies with low

CRP.

threshXLow

For a UE to reselect a cell on a carrier frequency with lower CRP, the RSRP of the

target cell must exceed a threshold the

EUtranFreqRelation.threshXLow attribute defines for that

frequency. The recommendation is to configure threshXLow

threshold with a small margin above threshServingLow threshold

used in the cells on the target frequency.

Related concepts

Sticky Carrier

Priority Carrier

### 9.7.2 Configuration of threshXHigh in Priority Carrier Configuration

For UEs to reselect a cell on a carrier frequency with higher CRP, the RSRP of the target

cell must exceed a threshold that attribute

EUtranFreqRelation.threshXHigh defines for that frequency. The

recommendation is to configure threshold threshXHigh with at least a

small margin higher than parameter threshServingLow used in the cells

on the target frequency.

The value of threshold threshXHigh can be further increased to reduce

the probability for UEs to select lower CRP carrier frequencies. This can be useful if

the priority carrier cells are large enough to be selected by significant number of UEs.

In this way, the bias achieved in the idle mode UE distribution can be moderated to a

suitable level. The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature can then be applied to tune

the UE distribution on top of that.

The possibility to exclude UEs in a good radio environment from load balancing can also

be beneficial in a priority carrier configuration like the one shown in Figure 9.

The F2 frequency has higher CRP than the F1 frequency. This means that all UEs within the

dotted lower circle perform idle mode cell reselection to the higher cell on frequency

F2. There is a high risk that such UEs are load balanced back to the lower cell if the

higher cell is more loaded than the lower cell. Avoid this by setting

ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold1Rsrp parameter so that

only UEs outside the coverage area are subject to load balancing. Coverage are is

defined by threshXHigh attribute.

Priority Carrier

### 9.7.3 Combination of Idle Mode Mobility

The sticky carrier and priority carrier configurations can be combined in a multi-carrier

network (one with more than two carrier frequencies).

Figure 10   Combination of Sticky Carrier and Priority Carrier Configurations

The sticky carrier configuration is typically applied between carrier frequencies with

similar coverage properties. The priority carrier configuration is suitable for carrier

frequencies with substantial loss of UEs. The loss can occur because areas have poor coverage

or have large coverage gap, and in areas where cells that are small compared to the cells on

other carrier frequencies.

The way to configure the idle mode mobility can alternate between different locations within

the network, depending on the local conditions.

Other principles for the configuration of the idle mode mobility are also possible. The

Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is not restricted to particular configurations of UE

idle mode cell reselection.

## 9.8 Uplink-Heavy UE Detection Configuration

Uplink-heavy UE detection can be enabled independently for the feature to improve the

UE selection process for load-balancing mobility actions.

The following attributes must be set to

true

to enable uplink-heavy UE detection for load-balancing mobility actions:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled

The following can be used to configure uplink-heavy UE detection:

- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTime
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst

The attributes that configure uplink-heavy UE detection are the same attributes used by

the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility and the Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation features.

Therefore, changing these attributes also affects their uplink-heavy detection

function.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q1: Preferential Traffic Management

The Preferential Traffic Management solution enables the operator to control user access

to priority and non-priority bands. With Preferential Traffic Management, it is possible to

define up to 12 subscriber groups denoted by a list of SPIDs and PLMN with different

selection priority for Inter-Frequency Offload and Admission-Triggered Offload.

| Feature Name:           | System Improvements in LTE RAN L19.Q1   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | 20/FAJ 121 1447                         |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node      |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

The Preferential Traffic Management solution offers the operator the possibility to efficiently

use an LTE network, deployed on several frequency bands, with one frequency band used

primarily for priority users. The solution enables the following:

- To use the priority band for both priority and non-priority users as long as co-existence rules allow it.
- To use the priority band exclusively for priority users in the intended traffic situations.
- To use the non-priority bands for both non-priority and priority users, both as coverage bands and bands to offload priority traffic when the priority band is overloaded.
- To define how Preferential Traffic Management functions treat specific UEs by using subscriber groups.

The load management policies used depend on the current traffic load level. Traffic load

states in the solution are defined by configurable load threshold parameters.

The solution is developed for existing commercial RAN infrastructure with a designated

band used as priority band, using an MOCN architecture. The solution is achieved by a

collection of extensions in existing licensed features, configured to work together.

For more detailed information on Preferential Traffic Management, see Preferential Traffic Management

Guidelines.

Capacity and Performance

The capacity on priority bands is limited for non-priority users and changes with network

congestion level. This is because of the need to provide uninterrupted connectivity

for priority users. During network congestion, an increased drop in mobility success

rate towards priority cells is expected.

Operation

The Preferential Traffic Management solution is activated on node level using the

PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute.

On the eNodeB, a maximum of four cell profiles can be configured, but a cell refers

to only one predefined profile. This controls which Preferential Traffic Management

actions are triggered on the cell. Each cell profile can be configured using the

PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute with the following

settings:

- PRIORITY
- NON\_PRIORITY

UE selection for Admission-Triggered Offload and Inter-Frequency Offload works only

if the PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute is set to

PRIORITY.

The function introduces the following new MO classes:

- PtmAtoConfig
- PtmCellProfile
- PtmFunction
- PtmIflbConfig
- PtmIfoConfig
- PtmResOpUseConfig
- PtmStmConfig
- PtmSubscriberGroup

This function is controlled by the following new parameters:

- PtmAtoConfig.minSuccRateThreshold
- PtmAtoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmCellProfile.cellType
- PtmFunction.ptmEnabled
- PtmIflbConfig.stopIncomingIflbThreshold
- PtmIflbConfig.stopOutgoingIflbEnabled
- PtmIfoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resSRatioThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresSRatioThreshold
- PtmStmConfig.inhibitImpInterval
- PtmStmConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmSubscriberGroup.plmn
- PtmSubscriberGroup.spidList

Handover of UEs with certain PLMN IDs and SPID to a

target cell can be blocked. This occurs when the PLMN ID of the UE is "reserved for

operator use" in the target cell. It can be reserved, because the priority cell has

a very high traffic load-subscription ratio or MSR usage. It is also required that

the SPID of the UE is configured in the PtmSubscriberGroup MO as

the PtmStmConfig MO refers to that group.

The following features are affected by the solution:

elements:

- ENM The enhancement requires ENM version 18.16 or later to be used.

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q2: Support for Load Balancing during Access Class Barring

This feature enhancement enables Inter-Frequency Load Balancing to continue outgoing

load balancing from overloaded cells with triggered Load-Based Access Barring.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement enables outgoing load balancing by calculating subscription ratio during

triggered Load-Based Access Barring on the cell. This allows the overloaded cell to

reduce the load faster and recover to normal state.

The function is supported on any cell, not only on priority cells defined by Preferential

Traffic Management.

Capacity and Performance

The main processor load is affected because of increased load balancing actions,

signaling, and handovers.

The enhancement can trigger the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure.

- EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from ENM version 19.04 or

## Appendix A.c: 22.Q4: Reserved Cell for Operator Use Improvement

This system improvement enables priority UEs to select and access priority cells in

high traffic load when the priority core network is not

available.

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement enhances accessibility for priority UEs as part of the

Preferential Traffic Management solution. It enables priority UEs that utilize

non-priority equivalent home PLMN to connect to priority bands and to fully utilize

priority cell resources under the following circumstances:

- The priority cells are in a high traffic load.
- The priority PLMN core network is not available due to S1-C connection failure.

Capacity and Performance

This system improvement can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedSubRatio
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedSubRatio

Operation

This system improvement introduces the

PtmResOpUseConfig.suspResOpUsePlmnList attribute. This

attribute can suspend dynamic PLMN reservation during S1-C connection failure. The

operator can select priority PLMNs for which the cell reservation is suspended.

If the PtmResOpUseConfig.suspResOpUsePlmnList attribute is empty,

which is the default value, any of the priority PLMNs can suspend dynamic PLMN

reservation for cells during S1-C connection failure.

This system improvement introduces the following PM events:

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces a mechanism to detect uplink-heavy UEs. If a UE

is identified as uplink-heavy, it can be excluded from load-balancing mobility

actions in FDD and TDD cells.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It is possible to detect uplink-heavy UEs for the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature.
- The UE selection process is improved for load-balancing actions.
- Ping-pong effect between cells for uplink-heavy UEs is reduced when the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility features are active at the same time in the network.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement decreases the number of uplink-heavy UE handovers triggered

by the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature.

This

can be observed with the following PM counters in the source

cells where the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature is active:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces attributes to control the detection of

uplink-heavy UEs. When the following attributes are set to true,

UEs marked as uplink-heavy are excluded from load-balancing mobility actions:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled

The following existing attributes are updated to control the detection of

uplink-heavy UEs when the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is not active:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulHeavyUeDetectEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.ulHeavyUeDetectEnabled

The following legacy attributes are used for specifying the configurations of

uplink-heavy UE detection for load balancing:

- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTime
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst

When uplink-heavy UE detection for load balancing is enabled in the cell, the

mechanism is applied to UEs that connect to the LTE cell through the following

processes:

- Incoming handover
- RRC initial setup
- RRC connection re-establishment

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
