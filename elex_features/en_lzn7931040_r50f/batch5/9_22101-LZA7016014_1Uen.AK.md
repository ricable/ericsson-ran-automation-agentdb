# 2 Benefits of IPsec

IPsec

protects the OSS and the EPC from malicious or involuntary attacks.

It

introduces authentication of nodes,

integrity

protection,

and adds confidentiality through

encryption of all the

traffic.

This is provided while maintaining performance characteristics.

For small cells, IPsec

can

be mandatory by

many operators. Ericsson solution can secure massive small cell

rollout in

untrusted

network,

where

autointegration

without laptop includes smooth implementation of

IPsec.

Protection of the OSS Infrastructure and the EPC Network

IPsec protects

the

network of the

operator from potential security breaches, which reduces the risk

of network downtime caused by an attack.

The use of IPsec dramatically reduces the risk of interception and injection of data

in the LTE system between the Baseband in the RBS and the SEG. IPsec also has the

added benefit of protecting the Core infrastructure of the network of the operator

since only the outer IP addresses of the IPsec tunnel or tunnels are visible outside

of the SEG. In this case, the inner IP addresses of the base stations and the secure

network (OSS/Core network) are not visible to anyone in the untrusted network. In

addition, IPsec uses encryption mechanisms to protect end-user and node traffic sent

over a network. It also includes integrity protection and replay protection.

IPsec

is

especially

important when an operator is liable for ensuring the integrity of

their subscribers or when an additional layer of protection is required for OAM.

Network Characteristics

Maintained

IPsec

in

eNodeB

uses

hardware

accelerators which makes the

IPsec

function perform faster than

on

a

normal CPU.

This

results in minor increase in size of the packets, but otherwise no degradation of

throughput. This is a competitive advantage, since other vendors

on the market are not using

hardware

accelerators in their

IPsec

implementation, and thereby have a significant reduction of the throughput when

IPsec

is enabled. Another benefit with the use of

hardware

accelerators is the very small increase in packet

delay.

Secure

Massive

Small

Cell

Rollout

IPsec

is included as part of the auto-integration procedure for

the deployment

of small cells

(Micro

and

Pico

RBSs)

and

it is a key mechanism for secure base station

enrollment.

IPsec requires authentication by using digital certificates (ID cards) in every node

making sure that only trusted vendors and operator nodes

are

allowed to connect to the

core

network.

# 3 IPsec Business Values

OPEX Reduction: Reduce O&amp;M Activities

Since IPsec

protects

the OSS and

core

network from malicious or involuntary attacks it is also protected against network

outage inflicted by such attacks.

This

reduces operational actions and troubleshooting

time that

occur as a consequence of such attacks.

By

enabling IPsec, the O&amp;M procedures become more advanced,

adding to the operational costs.

Thus

the risk and harm of being exposed

to

an attack are important

factors

to consider when

analysing

network outages and

calculating

O&amp;M savings.

Revenue Growth: Minimizing Loss of

Revenue

Since IPsec

protects

the OSS and the EPC from malicious or involuntary attacks,

they

are also protected against network outages inflicted by such

attacks. Reduced network outage

in

turn

leads

to reduced loss of

revenue.

Revenue Growth: Reduce

Churn

Deployment of security measures such as IPsec

results

in reduced network

downtime

and

reduces

the risk of bad image produced by security

breaches.

Summary

The IPsec feature uses IPsec ESP to provide the following for the IP layer:

- confidentiality
- authentication
- integrity protection
- anti-replay protection

The tunnel mode of IPsec also adds the VPN aspect, where IPsec can be used to

tunnel network traffic within one network over a third party network.

The

node supports IPsec using ESP tunnel mode for terminated IP traffic in the node.

IKEv2 is used as the control protocol. ESP processing is in compliance with RFC

4303, and the IKEv2 related processing is in compliance with RFC 7296. The node also

follows the applicable parts of the principles as defined in RFC 4301 security

architecture and the 3GPP security specifications (TS 33.210, TS 33.310, TS

33.401).

IPsec is used to protect user and control plane traffic (for example S1, X2, Iub, and Abis)

and OAM traffic.
