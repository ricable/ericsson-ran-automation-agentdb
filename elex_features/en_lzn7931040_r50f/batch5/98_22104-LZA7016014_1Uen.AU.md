Summary

The Redirect with System Information feature improves outage time when the UE is redirected

from LTE to one of the following networks:

- GSM
- WCDMA
- TD-SCDMA

This is important when performing a CS fallback, since the UE is able to

connect to the circuit switched domain faster.

The following concepts apply to the operation and maintenance of the Redirect with

System Information feature:

| External cell                          |    | External cells in the eNodeB hold information about cells in the 								following networks:  GERAN     UTRAN     E-UTRAN     TD-SCDMA                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| RAN Information Management association |    | A RAN Information Management association is created between the 								serving BSS and the target BSS for redirecting the UE with system 								information. The redirection with system information works between 								the cell on the serving BSS (eNodeB) and the cell on the target BSS 								(BSC or RNC node). |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The support of the Redirect with System Information feature is limited under shared

network setup. Only those RAN Information Management associations get established

that belong to the operator of primary PLMN.

Network Requirements

To benefit from this feature, the UEs must support

e-RedirectionUTRA-r9 or

e-RedirectionGERAN-r9 capability. For more information,

see 3GPP TS 36.331 Section 6.3.6.

# 3 Feature Operation of Redirect with System Information

This feature supports the redirection of UEs by adding system information for

cells.

The Redirect with System Information feature extends the following features by including

system information for cells belonging to the target RAT when performing RRC connection

release with redirect to GSM, WCDMA, or TD-SCDMA:

- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity
- CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN

The RAN Information Management function collects information from NACC for GERAN and

system information for UTRAN. The feature enables the UE to connect to the target cell faster

because the system information is directly supplied to it during release time. It is

unnecessary to read the system information from the target system.

## 3.1 RAN Information Management Pool Concept

Priority Pools

To limit the load on a system, RAN Information Management associations are set up to

some external cells. These cells are then subject to decision about redirection with

NACC at UE release or CS Fallback with NACC. The prioritized external cells are

selected based on the GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute.

For each E-UTRAN cell, two pools of prioritized external cells are created, one for

session continuity and one for CS Fallback purpose. Different sets of two pools are

created separately for GERAN and UTRAN. An external cell can be present in both the

session continuity and CS Fallback pools.

All pools from E-UTRAN cells are coordinated to create a primary set of associations

on an eNodeB level to avoid duplication of associations created for the same

external cell.

Building Priority Pools

The priority pools are initially built at the eNodeB start up. All GERAN and UTRAN

neighboring cells are initially evaluated from a license and RAN Information

Management association capability point of view. Suitable external cells are subject

to the prioritization algorithm to create the pools. After the evaluation, necessary

RAN Information Management associations are created.

Updating Priority Pools

The pools are updated dynamically when RAN Information Management conditions or

coverage conditions change. The eNodeB checks condition changes that affect pool

prioritization of external cells. A given cell can be moved in or out of a pool

depending on the circumstances.

Supervised conditions specifically concern the following points:

- The value of the GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute
- RAN Information Management capability
- Cell creation
- Cell removal
- Relation creation
- Relation removal

The adaptation of the pool content can result in the creation or removal of RAN

Information Management associations, according to the current needs.

If the eNodeB tags a target BSS as RIM\_INCAPABLE, the relevant

rimCapable attribute must be set to the following values in

this order to be able to set up an eNodeB association with BSS:

1. RIM\_INCAPABLE
2. RIM\_CAPABLE

## 3.2 Configuration

For a coverage-triggered RRC connection release with redirect, the system information is only

included f if the mobilityAction parameter is set to

RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT\_NACC for the specific RAT.

For a CS fallback-triggered RRC connection release with redirect, the system information is

only included if the mobilityActionCsfb parameter is set to

RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT\_NACC for the specific RAT.

For UTRAN, the system information is also included for CS fallback-triggered RRC connection

release after measurement timeout or handover preparation failure, if the

mobilityActionCsfb parameter is set to HANDOVER.

## 3.3 Prioritization of Cells

The prioritization of external cells is based on how the

GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is configured. The CSFB and

Session Continuity pools have their own level of priority.

Cell candidates with the same GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator value are placed in the prioritized

list in a random order. If there are more than four cell candidates with the same

GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator value placed in the top of the

prioritized list, only the first four cells from the list are used for pool constitution.

For the CSFB list, the eNodeB includes system information for cells with the

GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute set to the following values

in this order:

1. COVERS
2. OVERLAP
3. CONTAINED\_IN or NONE

For the Session Continuity list, the eNodeB includes system information for cells with the

GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute set to the following values

in this order:

1. COVERS
2. NONE
3. OVERLAP
4. CONTAINED\_IN

The Session Continuity and CSFB pool prioritization rules affect the number of

RAN Information

Management associations.

Each internal cell adds the first four candidates in its Session Continuity pool and its CSFB

pool.

Figure 1 shows what happens when the Session

Continuity and CSFB pool structure is the same in each internal cell.

Figure 1   An eNodeB with the Same External Cells Highly Prioritized

Each pool contains the same candidates, and every candidate has the

GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute set to

COVERS. Four active RAN Information Management associations are set up in

the eNodeB.

Since the Session Continuity and CSFB structures are the same in the internal cells, they add

the same external cells. However, each association is only added once, regardless of how many

internal cells it is used in. This is because the RAN Information Management associations are

between the eNodeB and the target cell.

Figure 2 shows what happens when the Session

Continuity and CSFB pool structure is different in each internal cell.

Figure 2   An eNodeB with Different External Cells Highly Prioritized

The pools contain different candidates, and the candidates have the

GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator or

UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute set to different values.

Six active RAN Information Management associations are set up in the eNodeB.

Each association is only added once, regardless of how many internal cells it is used in.

This is because the RAN Information

Management associations

are between the eNodeB and the target cell.
