# 1 Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation Overview

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature provides improved average

uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services without reducing VoIP capacity.

Summary

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature provides improved average

uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services in a mixed scenario with both VoIP

and MBB services. The feature improves throughput specifically when a large number

of VoIP users are active in the cell. This benefit does not reduce the VoIP

capacity. It is also possible to increase the VoIP capacity instead of improving the

average uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services.

By applying an age-dependent weight to VoIP packets, scheduling resources are only

used for VoIP services when this is required to avoid exceeding the PDB. This

results in scheduling several VoIP packets during a scheduling instance, and

efficient use of the RBS resources.

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature also decreases the delay of

VoIP packets from the UE that require Radio Link Control (RLC) segmentation. The

segments are scheduled in consecutive TTIs.

For UEs that are configured with DRX, and support 3GPP release 9 and onwards,

Scheduling Request (SR) Suppression is enabled while the UE is in VoIP TALK state.

This is to reduce power consumption in the UE.

# 3 Feature Operation of Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature is based on the age of the VoIP

packets, and the prioritized scheduling of the packets over MBB packets.

The high-level flow for scheduling applies for the Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant

Estimation feature, except that the scheduler is enabled for VoIP specific scheduling. For

more information on the high-level flow for scheduling, see Scheduler.

Operation

Delay-based scheduling is based on the concept that the scheduler knows the age of the VoIP

packets. By taking into account the age of the packet, the scheduler determines when the

VoIP packets need to be scheduled within the PDB.

If the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is active, VoLTE and PTT type of voice traffic

can exist. VoLTE and PTT traffic types need different optimization. The Delay-Based

Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature is able to detect if the traffic type is VoLTE or

PTT. The feature can handle both VoLTE and PTT traffic according to their special

characteristics.

When the scheduler determines that the VoIP packets need to be scheduled, their scheduling

is prioritized over MBB services. This results in an efficient scheduling of both voice and

MBB services. In certain cases, setting a high value for PDB results in a reduction of the

VoIP quality experienced by the end users. However, setting a small value for PDB results in

reduced average uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services in certain cases.

# 4 Network Impact of Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature impacts the MBB throughput and

the VoIP capacity.

Capacity and Performance

By default, the feature increases the uplink and downlink MBB throughput while the VoIP

capacity is not decreased. The throughput increase is most pronounced at high VoIP load.

In certain configurations, the feature increases the VoIP capacity. The MBB throughput is

not decreased in this case.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
