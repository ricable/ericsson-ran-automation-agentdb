Summary

AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision is a feature that delivers AI powered sleeping

cell detection function as an add-on to the existing Advance Cell Supervision

feature. The feature enhances the Advanced Cell Supervision feature with a machine

learning detector.

This new detector uses a previously trained model to detect sleeping cell

degradation. Training is performed in advance using network data. The trained model

is deployed in the node when software is updated.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature does not support downlink-only cells.

This feature does not support detecting sleeping cells in zero-traffic cases.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.05 or later is required.

# 3 Feature Operation of AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision

AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision adds a machine learning detector to existing

Advanced Cell Supervision.

Operational Process

AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision recovery action operates in the following

step-by-step process.

1. When started, the ML detector in the feature periodically checks if a sleeping cell is suspected.
2. If a sleeping cell is suspected, the feature checks if any automatic recovery action is required.
3. If automatic recovery action is required, the cell lock and unlock recovery action is implemented.
4. No alarm notification is sent if the recovery action is successful
5. An alarm raise notification is sent if no recovery action is required or if the recovery action is not successful.
6. The raised alarm ceases when all detectors stop suspecting sleeping cells.

Figure 1   AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision Recovery Action Flowchart

Anomaly Report

The feature produces anomaly report for the presence of outliers or concept drift in

the time period. Certain number of continuous outliers detection is suspected as a

sleeping cell.

Recovery Mechanism

This feature uses legacy Advanced Cell Supervision mechanism for recovery action and

alarm, see Advanced Cell Supervision for details.

## 3.1 AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision Modes

The mode of AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision can be configured among

OFF/OBSERVATION/NORMAL per cell.

Users can enable three different modes for AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision by the

new aiAdvCellSupMode attribute:

- Off mode:Disables AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision features.
- Observation mode:Enables AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision for observation mode only where a sleeping cell is observed without activating the recovery action. The mode provides anomaly report when AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision detects outliers for trace. Existing PM event is generated accordingly. Observation mode has no alarm and no recovery action. Concept drift should be monitored in Observation mode. Alert can be generated if the concept drift is identified. If a concept drift is detected, the node switches to Off mode and rely on the legacy detectors.
- Normal mode:Enables sleeping cells to be detected by the new ML detector. Legacy Advanced Cell Supervision is disabled when AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision is activated as Normal Mode. Normal mode provides anomaly report when AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision detects outliers for trace. Existing PM event is generated accordingly. Concept drift should be monitored in Observation mode. If a concept drift is detected, the node switches to Off mode and relies on the legacy detectors. Alarm can be generated if sleeping cell is detected by AI Powered Advanced Cell Supervision. Normal mode provides two different recovery actions by new aiAdvCellSupAction attribute: No Action: No recovery action is allowed. Cell Restart: Cell restart action is allowed.
