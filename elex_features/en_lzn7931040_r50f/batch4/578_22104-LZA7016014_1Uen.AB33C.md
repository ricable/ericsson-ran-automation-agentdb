# 1 LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control Overview

The feature improves downlink signal quality by reducing EVM. The feature backs off

power from PDSCH when it is scheduled with 256-QAM modulation.

Summary

The feature backs off power to reduce EVM when power amplifiers run at a power level

that is close to or at maximum power. The power backoff avoids clipping and reduces

EVM, which results in higher throughput.

When the feature is activated and 256-QAM modulation is scheduled for a UE, power

backoff is applied.

Peak throughput results show gains when backoff is used at a power level that is

close to or at maximum power in ideal radio frequency conditions.

Radio reporting is valid on Massive MIMO radio units and some Remote radio units with

external antenna. For other cases, a generic backoff value is determined by the

Baseband Radio Node.

In ESS deployments, the scheduler considers the traffic load for LTE and NR cells.

The feature improves throughput for high SINR users when power and traffic are close

to or at maximum levels. The scheduler continues to guide power backoff if one of

the partner cells in the ESS configuration is locked or deactivated.

# 2 Dependencies of LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

The feature has dependencies to other features that have an impact on the

configuration and the coverage of LTE downlink data and power control.

Hardware

The feature is not supported on the following hardware units:

- Radio Gateway
- LC-05 9xCPRI line card in conversion mode

Limitations

The UE must support 256-QAM in downlink. This limitation applies to all radio

segments.

Radio reporting is valid on Massive MIMO radio units and the following Remote radio

units:

- Radio 4485
- Radio 4486
- Radio 4490
- Radio 4490HP
- Radio 4494
- Radio 4823
- Radio 4890HP

Network Requirements

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

The LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control feature selects and applies a power backoff value

based on the cell configuration.

Operational Process

When radio reporting is valid for Remote radio units, the LTE Modulation-Aware

Power Control feature is enabled by default. When radio reporting is not valid, the

feature is disabled by default.

For more information on enabling or disabling the feature, see Enable or Disable LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram of LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

The scheduler applies the power backoff functionality to 256-QAM-capable UEs with the

following operation flow:

1. When radio reporting is valid for Remote radio units with external antenna, the scheduler checks the traffic load and the backoff value to enable power backoff.
2. The scheduler estimates if backoff is necessary for each user.
3. The backoff values are selected according to the cell configuration.
4. The corresponding power backoff values are sent to the physical layer.
5. The backoff value is applied against the gain value and sent to the radio unit.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

The feature improves 256-QAM throughput when the radio unit is close to or at maximum

power, and might improve BLER in certain configurations.

Capacity and Performance

256-QAM throughput is improved for radios configured to operate close to or at

maximum transit power.

The EVM-aware scheduler function of the LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control feature

might improve BLER in LTE single mode configurations.

Interfaces

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## 7.1 Enable or Disable LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

The feature can be enabled or disabled by setting the value of the

SectorCarrier.ltePowerBackoffMode attribute.

Figure 2   Feature Activation

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

A specific configuration is recommended in ESS deployments when radio reporting is

not valid.

In ESS deployments, if radio reporting is valid, it is recommended to use the default

configuration of MOM attributes. If radio reporting is not valid, the following

configuration is recommended:

- The value of the SectorCarrier.ltePowerBackoffMode attribute must be set to STATIC on the LTE cell.
- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute must be set to true on the NR cell.
- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.radioReportControlled attribute must be set to false on the NR cell.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                            |

Summary and Benefits

The scheduler considers EVM and transmitted output power to guide power backoff and

decide how to schedule on LTE carriers.

The feature prevents excessive power backoff in cases where EVM is not too high and

transmitted power is below the maximum threshold.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement improves data throughput. The scheduler orders less power

for each PRB if the lower output power with a reduced EVM provide improved

performance.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

SectorCarrier.lteBbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute to control

power backoff when radio reporting is not valid.

When radio reporting is valid, the feature enhancement is enabled by default and

SectorCarrier.evmPowerBackoffAllowed controls power

backoff.

The feature enhancement requires radio reporting to be valid, otherwise the feature

enhancement is disabled by default.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement is supported on the following radio units:

- Radio 4490
- Radio 4490HP
- Radio 4890HP

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
