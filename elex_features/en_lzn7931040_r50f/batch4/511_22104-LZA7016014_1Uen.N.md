# 1 Unique PCI and EARFCN in CBRS Overview

This feature resolves possible PCI and EARFCN conflicts by allowing duplicate PCI and

EARFCN tuples on CBRS band 48.

| Access Type            | LTE                                                    |
| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature. No license is required |

Summary

The feature allows duplicate PCI and EARFCN tuples on CBRS band 48 only if the previously

configured cell is not transmitting.

The feature offers the following benefits:

- CBRS cells in the same sector can be configured with the same PCI.
- The configuration and use of CBRS is not affected.
- The feature enhances the PCI Conflict Reporting feature. No manual intervention is required to resolve PCI and EARFCN conflicts, and cell downtime is reduced.
- The overall robustness and reliability of CBRS is improved.

# 2 Dependencies of Unique PCI and EARFCN in CBRS

The feature is only supported on CBRS band

48.

| PCI Conflict Reporting                                 (FAJ 121 1898) | Related        | Temporary PCI conflicts can occur on band 48 due to the             possibility of having temporary duplicates for PCI and EARFCN tuples. To report these             conflicts, it is recommended to activate the PCI Conflict Reporting feature on both the             source and the target Baseband. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature is only supported on CBRS band 48.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.1 or later is required for this feature, which

includes support for the following requirements:

- CBRS Domain Coordinator
- Sequential processing of group configurations

The feature is applicable for CBRS cells. For more information, see Citizens Broadband Radio Service Guidelines.

# 3 Feature Operation of Unique PCI and EARFCN in CBRS

The feature resolves possible PCI and EARFCN conflicts and checks if the EARFCN value is

set properly.

In channel assignment, it is possible that cells get assigned with PCI and EARFCN values,

which are already assigned to other non-transmitting cells. However, this conflicts with

the RAN configuration validation rules. The feature resolves this possible conflict by

allowing duplicate PCI and EARFCN tuples on CBRS band 48. The CBRS Domain Coordinator

checks and ensures that the previously configured cell is not transmitting.

The feature improves the PCI conflict reporting function for CBRS. Temporary PCI

conflicts for CBRS cells on frequency band 48 are not reported because of automatic CBRS

cell reconfiguration.

Additionally, the feature checks if the EARFCN is in the range of band 48. If the value

of the EUtranCellTDD.earfcn attribute is not set between

55240 and 56739, an error message is raised.

For more information, see Citizens Broadband Radio Service

Guidelines.

# 4 Network Impact of Unique PCI and EARFCN in CBRS

intervention.

Capacity and Performance

The possible PCI and EARFCN conflicts are resolved. Therefore, no manual intervention

is required, and cell downtime is reduced.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

|------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EUtranCellTDD.cbrsCell | Affected | If the EUtranCellTDD.cbrsCell attribute is set to                                     true, the feature checks the value of the                                     EUtranCellTDD.earfcn attribute. If the value                                 is set between 55240 and 56739,                                 the frequency is in the range of band 48. Otherwise, an error                                 message is raised. |
| EUtranCellTDD.earfcn   | Affected | If the EUtranCellTDD.cbrsCell attribute is set to                                     true, the feature checks the value of the                                     EUtranCellTDD.earfcn attribute. If the value                                 is set between 55240 and 56739,                                 the frequency is in the range of band 48. Otherwise, an error                                 message is raised. |

# 6 Performance of Unique PCI and EARFCN in CBRS

This feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q3: Fake PCI Conflict Prevention on CBRS Band

The feature enhancement adjusts the PCI conflict reporting function to avoid false

positive reports if the EARFCN belongs to frequency band 48.

| Feature Name:           | Unique PCI and EARFCN in CBRS   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5304                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                             |

When configuring CBRS cells, the PCI conflict reporting function can create temporary

false positive PCI conflict reports for cells with frequency from band 48. The feature

enhancement changes the legacy conflict reporting timer procedure to avoid such

conflicts.

The operation of the PCI conflict reporting procedure is unchanged for other cell bands

and non-temporary CBRS band conflicts.

Benefits

The feature enhancement makes the Ericsson CBRS solution more robust and reliable by

preventing false positive PCI conflict reports.

Capacity and Performance

No additional efforts and resources are required for resolving false positive PCI

conflicts caused by dynamically allocated spectrum.

Operation

The feature enhancement deprecates the

ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary77 attribute, as the Unique PCI

and EARFCN in CBRS feature is enabled by default.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.4 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

ENM with CBRS Domain Coordinator is required for CBRS support.
