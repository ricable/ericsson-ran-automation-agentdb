Summary

The Radio Dot System (RDS) Location Support feature enables location-based services (LBS)

for indoor venues. It provides User Equipment (UE) position measurements, such as Uplink

(UL) and Downlink (DL) Radio Frequency (RF) signals, on a per Radio Dot basis, for the

Ericsson Network Location (ENL) to calculate basic UE positioning. This feature supports

both Periodic and On Demand measurement reporting.

The RDS Location Support feature supports active positioning and uses Location

Positioning Protocol A (LPPa) E-CID messages (with proprietary extensions) to request

LTE UE positioning reports from ENL. The ENL performs AECID calculations, which

determine the geolocation of the UE.

This feature supports 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz LTE Channels in FDD mode. RDS Location

Support is license-controlled, and supports up to 336 UEs per Digital Unit on 20 MHz LTE

FDD carriers.

This feature requires accurate GPS coordinate data for all installed Dots. Installers

should use the Ericsson Indoor Planner (EIP) to plan the network, assess expected

accuracy, and determine the Dot locations. EIP is a useful tool to optimize Dot

placement for best performance.

As with all positioning technologies, absolute accuracy depends on many factors and

cannot be guaranteed. Understanding the factors that affect UE location accuracy can

help to achieve the best possible results:

- Positioning accuracy scales with Inter-Dot-Spacing (ISD) and performs better with 20m ISD than 30m ISD.
- Accuracy is affected by deployment, where a minimum of four Dots is recommended. For best performance, Dots should be installed at a typical ceiling height of 3 m.
- Environmental factors affect accuracy, with better results in Line of Sight (LoS) deployments than non-Line of Sight (nLoS), since structures such as walls, elevators, stairwells, metal cabinets and even body shadowing contribute to blocking radio waves.

In LoS non-shadowed conditions with DOT ISD of 20m, the RDS Location Support  feature can

achieve 7-10m Root Mean Square Error (RMS) accuracies for UE locations.

# 2 Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met for the feature to be operable:

- Installers are required to determine the geolocation (x,y) of the Radio Dots, and to enter this data, as well as the floor (z) and height above the floor, into specific Managed Objects (MOs). Refer to Deployment Guidelines. Note: If a Radio Dot is moved to a new location, the new position coordinate values must be entered for that Radio Dot.
- The license for the optional feature E-CID support LPPa and the license for the optional feature RDS Location Support must both be activated in the RBS.
- The cell serving the UE must be an RDS cell in state Enabled.
- An MO CellPortionRd per Radio Dot must exist for the cell. When the feature RDS Location Support is operable, and an RDS cell is unlocked, the MO CellPortionRd is created per Radio Dot to hold positioning measurement information needed by ENL when calculating the UE position. The MO CellPortionRd is deleted by the system when the cell is disabled.

# 3 Deployment Guidelines

It is highly recommended to use the Ericsson Indoor Planner, a network design tool for

the Ericsson small-cell portfolio of products that automates the planning process, and

significantly reduces planning times. It enables users to import a floor plan and use it

to create a plan for the locations of small-cell products and associated cabling. Users

can modify floor attributes such as wall materials and structures to produce more

accurate planning results. Users can modify node locations to suit their own situation,

view coverage maps, execute dominance modeling, and so on. Refer to Ericsson

Indoor Planner.

EIP Support for Radio Dot WGS-84 GPS Coordinates

Ericsson Indoor Planner Rel. 20.1 includes a function to assess the overall

positioning accuracy of this feature. This feature empowers customers to assess

different Radio Dot placements to not only achieve the desired system performance

such as throughput, but also to optimize UE location accuracy.

During the project creation process, users can place GPS pins at the locations where

they want Radio Dots to be placed. Six characteristics for each pin are

provided:

- Ericsson Indoor Planner X Coordinate (Meters or Feet): The X position of the GPS pin in Ericsson Indoor Planner coordinates. This field is populated automatically based on the position of the pin on the floor.
- Ericsson Indoor Planner Y Coordinate (Meters or Feet): The Y position of the GPS pin in Ericsson Indoor Planner coordinates. This field is populated automatically based on the position of the pin on the floor.
- Ericsson Indoor Planner Elevation (Meters or Feet): The elevation of the pin in Ericsson Indoor Planner coordinates.
- GPS Latitude (Degrees): Latitude of the pin's WGS-84 position, in degrees.
- GPS Longitude (Degrees): Longitude of the pin's WGS-84 position, in degrees
- GPS Altitude (Meters or Feet): Altitude of the pin's WGS-84 position.

Ericsson Indoor Planner places Radio Dots at the pin coordinates and generates

coverage maps for the building. It also generates a solution report that includes

the GPS location information for each Radio Dot.

EIP Pin Placement

Dominance

Plan the Radio Dot System for dominance where RSRP (LTE) is 3-10 dB greater than the

received Macro levels.

This feature requires the UE to be attached to the RDS network; therefore, indoor

dominance must be ensured through EiP planning.

Capacity and Coverage

Ericsson Indoor Planner Rel. 20.1 calculates the GPS (WGS-84) coordinates of all Dots

on the floor plan. Once the customer enters the GPS coordinates of two corners of

the floor plan, EIP will then automatically calculate the GPS coordinates of each

Dot which installers may enter into the MO.

Small cells are used by operators to expand capacity and fill coverage holes in their

networks cost-effectively. Given capacity expansion and coverage extension, small

cells can be deployed as:

- A capacity layer in high traffic areas and targeted hotspots.
- A way to enhance consumer quality of experience (QoE) in a wide area / non-targeted hotspot.
- A way to extend mobile penetration and provide data offload for high traffic areas and hotspot locations inside buildings.

The following rules of thumb apply to capacity and coverage:

- To ensure coverage, Radio Dots must be close to or in common areas, and farther from technical storage rooms or washrooms.
- Place Radio Dots around areas with losses (elevators, supporting walls).
- To ensure the expected coverage, space the Radio Dots approximately 20 m apart. In a grid layout, this spacing equates to a coverage area of approximately 600 m2.
- Radio signal leakage between floors of a building can be strong (as low as 10 dB isolation). This creates an Radio Dot layout dependency when adjacent floors are fed from the same cell: If the adjacent floor is fed from a different cell/IRU, lay the Radio Dots inline. This allows the Radio Dots on one floor to counter the interference from the adjacent floor without creating handover boundaries or affecting the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SINR).

- scale:30 If the adjacent floor is in the same cell (same IRU or Combined Cell), lay the Radio Dots in a zig-zag pattern. This allows Radio Dots from the adjacent floor to fill in "cold" spots. Since they belong to the same cell, no handover boundary is created. scale:30

![Image](../images/5_22104-FGB1010308_1Uen.E2B/additional_3_CP.png)

- Ensure that there is more capacity in common areas and less in technical storage rooms, washrooms, and so on.
- One cell per floor if the capacity targets allow it.
- This feature applies AECID techniques to accurately assess the UE locations. Each floor should, therefore, have a minimum of three Radio Dots to enable the algorithm to match the UE position.
- Space Radio Dots 20 m apart for best coverage and throughput.

Attention!

Before activating the RDS Locztion Support feature, it is

important to verify that the Radio Dot locations are correct. Refer to Verifying Radio Dot Locations.

EIP Simulated Accuracy

EIP is highly recommended for customers who intend to use or trial the RDS Location

Support feature. While absolute accuracy cannot be guaranteed, EIP helps installers

to visualize the deployment and correct for many of the factors that affect

accuracy.

EIP automatically calculates Dot GPS coordinates, as this task, when performed

manually, is prone to errors. EIP simulations can highlight nLoS factors, such as

reinforced concrete elevator shafts or stairwells which can significantly impact

positioning accuracy. Installers using EIP can position Dots to mitigate these

factors. EIP simulation results are better when Dot ISD does not exceed 20 m, there

is a minimum of four Dots, and the Dots are installed at a ceiling height of 3

m.

EIP performs a multi-variable Monte-Carlo simulation of radio wave propagation

factors to estimate average expected accuracy. Absolute accuracy depends on many

factors and cannot be guaranteed. EIP does not assess absolute accuracy, which can

vary significantly from the average due to factors such as body shadowing, nearby

clutter, or other factors.

# 4 Verifying Radio Dot Geolocations

Before activating the RDS Location Feature, it is highly recommended to verify that

each Radio Dot geolocation corresponds to where the Radio Dot is actually located in

the site (for example, the Dot is on the correct floor and with the right IRU, and

the Cell Portion information aligns with the actual locations).

Prerequisites

- Necessary access and authorization to the network management system and Network Elements (NEs). For information on security management controls and functions, refer to the following document and action: ENM Security System Administrator Guide, 2/1543-AOM 901 151.
- Advanced MO Scripting (AMOS) is launched from the ENM Launcher. Note: For detailed information on AMOS, refer to AMOS, Advanced MO Scripting, 1/1553-CNA 403 3129.
- Log on to the node using AMOS.

Radio Dot locations can be verified by going under each Radio Dot (walkaround) and

powering off and powering on each Radio Dot and resetting the power:

Do!

The commands must be performed on both sides of the Radio Dot if it is a Dual

Band Radio Dot.

Steps

1. Execute the following command to power off the Radio Dot where &lt;BXP\_2048&gt; is the IRU and &lt;1&gt; is the Radio Dot: lhsh BXP\_2048 rd power 1 off Note: The LED light should be off after powering off the Radio Dot.

# 8 Feature Operation of RDS Location Support

This feature enables Location-Based Services (LBS) and is split across three functional

elements: the eNodeB which measures per Radio Dot UE UL RF signals, the UE which

provides UL RSRP reports, and the Ericsson Network Location (ENL) which initiates the

measurement process and collects and performs AECID calculations on the eNodeB power

measurements to determine the geolocation of the UE.

Radio Dot System installers are required to determine the geolocation (x, y)  of the

Radio Dots, and to enter this data, as well as the floor (z) and height above the floor,

into specific Managed Objects (MOs).

If the feature RDS Location Support is activated, and the cell becomes unlocked, one MO

CellPortionRd is auto-generated per Radio Dot to hold the

Radio Dot location information needed by ENL when calculating the UE position.

The Active Positioning end-to-end message flow is described in the following sequence:

1. The Location-Based Service (LBS) client sends a location service request to the Network Location Gateway (NLG) node in ENL. NLG acts as the gateway between the clients of the LCSs, that is, the middleware or applications, and the network providing the locations. The NLG initiates the positioning procedure selection flow, and then returns the positioning result to the LCS Client.
2. The NLG sends a Routing Info request to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS).
3. The HSS responds with a Routing Info response to the NLG.
4. The NLG sends a Subscriber Location Request to the Mobility Management Entity (MME).
5. The MME sends a Location Notification to the eNodeB.
6. The eNodeB responds with a Location Notification Return Result message to the MME.
7. The MME sends a Location Request to the Network Location Server (NLS) node in ENL.The NLS is the Ericsson implementation of SMLC.
8. The NLS responds to the MME with a Positioning Request.
9. The MME/NLS sends a message to the eNodeB that carries the LPPa message E-CID Measurement Initiation Request for RDS Measurement. Note: The eNodeB checks the feature license, and if it is not activated, no RDS position measurements are performed. However, measurements for other requested information are performed.
10. The eNodeB replies with an E-CID Measurement Initiation Response to confirm initiation of the measurement.
11. The eNodeB requests the UE to send UL transmissions. Note: Measurements are made per Radio Dot.
12. The eNodeB measures UE UL RSSI per Radio Dot, allowing each of the eight/sixteen Radio Dots to record the UL RSSI. When an RDS cell is unlocked and the feature RDS Location Support is activated, the MO CellPortionRd is created per Radio Dot to hold Radio Dot information needed by NLS when calculating the UE position. CellPortionRd MOs exist as a child to the EUtranCellFDD/ EUtranCellTDD MO. MO CellPortionRd is not created for uninstalled Radio Dots on an IRU. Note: If an RDS cell is locked when the feature RDS Location Support is active, the eNodeB then deletes all CellPortionRd MOs of the cell.
13. The result is reported in E-CID Measurement Report messages to MME/NLS, with the requested periodicity (lowest allowed value is 480ms). If it is on demand reporting, the result is reported in E-CID Measurement Initiation Response message. RDS UE positioning data is contained in the proprietary IE RDS Measurement Result. The NLS processes trilateration calculations which determine the geolocation of the UE. Four (4) Radio Dot measurements are recommended to enable the ENL AECID algorithms to locate each UE. Note: If the RDS cell serving the UE is in the state Enabled, but the optional feature RDS Location Support is not operable, then the E-CID Measurement Report message does not contain any RDS measurement results.
14. The NLG sends a Subscriber Location Response to the LCS Client.

Interfaces

The RDS Location Support feature uses standardized interfaces. The LPPa E-CID messages

between ENL and eNodeB have proprietary information elements to address the specific

requirements for indoor positioning with the Radio Dot System. The ENL system must be

used when deploying this feature.

Hardware

The RDS Location Support feature requires the use of specific Baseband units, Indoor

Radio Units, and Radio Dots.

Depending on the bandwidth required and the deployment connectivity, the following

Baseband units are supported:

- IDU 5205
- IDU 5209
- Baseband 5212
- Baseband 5216
- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630

The following Indoor Radio Units (IRUs) are supported:

- IRU 2242 (KRC 161 444/3)

The following Radio Dots are supported for this feature:

- RD 2243
- RD 4442

Other Network Elements

RDS Location Support requires support from the following network elements:

- The Ericsson Network Location (ENL) which initiates the measurement process, collects, and performs AECID calculations on the eNodeB measurements to provide geolocation and indoor civic locations to customer application servers.

# 9 Network Impact of RDS Location Support

RDS Location Support does not impact any system KPIs, capacity, coverage, throughput,

latency, handover time, or counter values.

# 10 Parameters for RDS Location Support

Prerequisites

Installers are required to calculate the geolocations (x,y) of the Radio Dots, and to

enter this data, as well as the floor (z) and height above the floor, into specific

Managed Objects (MOs). Satellite GPS signals do not typically penetrate buildings,

therefore, Ericsson recommends that installers use scaled building maps with

Ericsson Indoor Planner to determine the geolocation coordinates of the Radio Dots.

For information on setting Radio Dot position coordinates, refer to Setting Radio Dot positionCoordinate Values

(LTE).

CellPortionRd Creation

If the feature RDS Location Support is activated, and the cell becomes unlocked, one

MO CellPortionRd is created per Radio Dot to hold the Radio

Dot location information required by ENL when calculating the UE position. The

CellPortionRd MO contains the position coordinate values

originally entered by the installers.

The CellPortionRd MOs are auto-generated from

RdData and  AuxPlugInUnit or

FieldReplaceableUnit MO data.

CellPortionRd MOs exist as a child to the

EUtranCellFDD MO.

MO CellPortionRd

The MO CellPortionRd represents an area within a Radio Dot

Cell, which can be used by RDS Location Support.

Persistent: No

The MO CellPortionRd is created by the system when the cell is

unlocked and the feature RDS Location Support is activated.

The MO CellPortionRd is deleted by the system when the cell is disabled.

# 11 Setting Radio Dot positionCoordinate Values (LTE)

Location information can be defined in the form of GPS coordinates and textual

information for in-building localization at the Radio Dot level. These attributes

are located under the AuxPlugInUnit or

FieldReplaceableUnit Managed Object depending on the

software release.

The positionInformation attribute contains a description of the

location of the Radio Dot within the building. The purpose of this attribute is to

localize a dot when repair is needed. The attribute format is free text to allow the

operator to specify any form of localization information.

The positionCoordinates attribute (Altitude, Latitude, and

Longitude) contains a coordinate-based definition of the location of the Radio Dot

within the building. The purpose of this attribute is to enable indoor positioning

and SON-type tuning features in the future. This attribute contains universally

understandable data for x, y, z positioning. The data allows 0.1 m precision (as it

is vital to know, for example, on which side of a wall a person is). The data is

entered in "GPS-style" format as the default coordinate system is set to WGS84; the

reference coordinate system used for GPS.

The following example displays location information (pillar-X3) and GPS coordinates

from the AMOS CLI:

# 12 RDS Location Support Positioning Records

ENL uses imported RDS cell portion data when calculating the positioning of mobile

subscribers in an LTE network. The RDS cell portion data is stored in the database.

Positioning records are generated and managed from through the ENL Administration Portal or

CLI (ltecli).

Importing RDS Positioning Data

Through system integration activities, a mechanism can be implemented to extract cell data

from involved RANs. The cell data is then aggregated into a common file using Ericsson MPC

LTE Specific format that then can be transferred to ENL using SFTP.

Alternatively, cell data can be imported directly from Ericsson OSS-RC/ENM using the

Ericsson Specific Attributes format.

ENL can be configured to automatically retrieve cell data periodically through SFTP.

Configuring RDS Positioning

All configurable parameters for positioning records are defined in the

Positioning Records page of the ELS Administration Portal.

Positioning records can be generated after a predefined interval, the total size of all

positioning record files in the specified folder can be configured by the parameter Total

Size (MB), the default directory for storing the positioning record files can be specified,

and so on.

For information about the configuration of the positioning record function, refer to the

following document:

- Feature Workflow Configuration Guide, 5/1543-CSH 109 757

The Radio Dot System (RDS) is a positioning method utilized in ELS within the LTE network.

The Radio Dot System Positioning under E-SMLC contains the configuration parameters on the

ELS server for the RDS method in the LTE network.

To configure Parameters for RDS Positioning:

In the Administration Portal, click Feature Workflow&gt; E-SMLC&gt; Parameter

Settings&gt; RDS Positioning to display the RDS Positioning page. Configure

the following parameters in the RDS Positioning page:

- RDS Confidence Level
- RDS LPPa Response Timeout
- RDS LPPa Report Characteristics
- RDS Measurement Periodicity
- RDS Log Level
- RDS IMSI Log Level

For more information about the parameters, refer to the section PPESMLC in Parameter List, NLS, AECID, 1/190 59-CSH 109

757.

Enabling or Disabling Cell Portion and Radio Dot Cell Portion

The following parameter specifies whether to enable or disable cell portion and Radio Dot

cell portion.  Parameters are configured on the Administration Portal.

For the complete list of the parameters for one LTE cell, refer to LTE Cell Data File and CLI Description, ENL. Both

the NLG and NLS support the export of the stored LTE cell data to an XML based file..

Fetching Positioning Records

RDS Location Support positioning records can be viewed through the LCS client or they can

be exported in XML format directly from ENL using the positioning record feature.

Positioning records are stored as files on the NLG or NLS server at a predefined location.

The default directory for storing the positioning record files is

/var/opt/mpc/positioningrecord.

The files are stored in the XML format defined by Ericsson. A positioning record file can

contain one or more positioning records.

Example for LTE Positioning with RDS Result

The following positioning record example defines one RDS result record. Multiple

information elements are defined in the positioning record file.

# 15 Security Management of RDS Location Support

Radio Dot System handles only specific inputs for calculating UE position, so there is a

low risk of misused privacy data.

When ENL requests E-CID measurement of the target UE, the eNodeB reports the associated

Cell Portion ID of the target UE through MME. ENL then calculates the UE position. Only

partial information (entry data for positioning algorithm) is sent, such as Temporary

MME S1.AP UE ID, Cell Portion ID, and RSRP / TA. Explicit UE coordinates are not visible

on the S1 interface.

With explicit location position requests, UEs may be spammed by advertisers. RDS Location

Support is an optional feature and it is license controlled. Positioning privacy data

are managed externally by ELG node. ELG is responsible for consent handling and

implementation of national legislation requirements.

For information on ENL security and privacy, refer to Security and Privacy, ENL, 2/1553-HSC 901 178.

During tracing activities, partial UE location data may be fetched during troubleshooting

when data is streamed to ELS over Mul. Information available at the eNodeB is not

sufficient to track a user. Only the end-to-end system has information to track the

user. End-to-end privacy assessment involves ELS and ELG nodes to be sure that privacy

data are handled correctly over Ericsson network. Additionally, traces can only be

activated with specific OAM user roles. Tracing activity is limited to Role Base Access

Control (RBAC).

# 16 Activate RDS Location Support

This is a licensed feature. For the feature to be operational, a valid license key must

be installed in the node, and the feature must be explicitly activated by setting a MOM

attribute. Use this procedure to activate the RDS Location Support feature.
