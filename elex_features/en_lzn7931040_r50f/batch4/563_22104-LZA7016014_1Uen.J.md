Summary

This

feature increases the number of maximum supported GTP-U paths on Baseband

Radio

Nodes and increases the number of core network user plane

connections to support Cloud core network deployments with many Serving Gateway IP

addresses. The increased number of S1-U GTP-U paths can be

supervised with the GTP-U Supervision feature if it is enabled for the core network

connections on the eNodeB. This has no negative impact on the performance of GTP-U

Supervision feature.

The GTP-U connection, also referred to as GTP-U path or GTP-U link, is a unidirectional or

bidirectional IP path identified by the local and the remote IP address pair. A

single GTP-U connection can carry GTP-U messages that are related to multiple GTP-U

tunnels. A GTP-U tunnel within a single GTP-U connection is identified by the TEID

value.

The main benefit of this feature is that the cardinality increase of the S1-U links removes

the

limitations

that might occur when the eNodeB is connected to Cloud-based EPC networks.

| GTP-U Supervision (FAJ 121 2024) | Related        | If the GTP-U Supervision feature is enabled on the eNodeB, it can                                 supervise the increased number of core network connections, that is,                                 the increased number of GTP-U paths. When the PM counters for GTP-U                                 supervision or for user data traffic are activated, the amount of                                 GTP-U management messages on the network and the size of ROP files                                 are increased.  PM report might not contain counters for all created GTP-U paths when                                 S1-U redundancy is configured. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

The LTE Increased Number of GTP-U Connections feature increases the maximum number of

supported GTP-U paths in the Baseband

Radio

Node to 4095. The node limit is shared between all RATs installed on

the

Baseband

Radio Node and all interfaces using GTP-U connections.

The feature also increases the number of supported S1-U links and

TermPointToSGW MO instances from 64 to 600. PM counters are

stored and reported in ROP files for up to 600 S1-U and for up to 512 X2-U links. The

TermPointToSGW MO instance is created by the system when the

first S1-U bearer is set with unique remote IP address to the remote Serving Gateway.

For S1-U link redundancy configuration, two child gtpPath MOs might

be configured. When the TermPointToSGW MO Class cardinality is

reached,

new

MO instance is not created.

Still,

new S1-U bearer can be set until the node limit of the number of

GTP-U paths is reached. The number of supported bearers depends on

the

radio unit. For more information, see, Supported Capacity and Configurations.

Figure 1 shows the GTP-U path setup and the TermPointToSGW MO instance

creation algorithm of the feature.

Figure 1   GTP-U Path and TermPointToSGW MO Creation Algorithm

The TermPointToSGW MO instance is kept at node restart. The

TermPointToSGW MO instance is removed 2 hours and 35 minutes

after the last S1-U bearer using that link is released.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

This feature has a capacity impact, interface impact, and an ENM version

requirement.

Capacity and Performance

The increased number of core network connections has no impact on the number of S1

bearers used on the node.

Interfaces

The S1-U interface is upgraded to higher MO cardinality.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 22.2 or later is required for this

feature.

# 5 Parameters for LTE Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

With this feature, the cardinality of an MO Class is increased.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter      | Type     | Description          |
|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| TermPointToSGW | Affected | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of LTE Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

This feature does not introduce or use new KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

The

following KPIs are taken back to baseline if they are degraded because of the

exhaustion of the GTP-U path resources:

- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in eNodeB
- E-RAB Establishment Success Rate KPIs

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
