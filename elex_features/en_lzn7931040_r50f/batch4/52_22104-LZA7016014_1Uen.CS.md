Summary

The purpose of the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature is

to evaluate if inter-frequency neighbor cells are suitable for inter-frequency load

balancing or inter-frequency offload. Suitable inter-frequency neighbor cells are

automatically and dynamically configured as load balancing relations. This feature

reduces the need for manual configuration of load management relations.

This feature has the following benefits:

- This automatic configuration is crucial in network deployments with several frequency layers and different cell grids. Manual configuration is difficult in such network deployments.
- Dynamic configuration of load management relations improves load management efficiency and reduces the workload of manual configuration.
- By considering suitable targets and removing unsuitable targets, load balancing is optimized and used to determine the amount of traffic load that is handed over to each target cell. Additional unsuitable target cells in the list reduce the chance of utilizing suitable targets and can also increase the number of unnecessary UE measurements.

|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inter-frequency measurements | The number of inter-frequency measurements increases when the                                     Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature is                                     activated. The number of extra measurements depends on the                                     configured attributes for hit-rate measurement intensity and the                                     number of defined frequency layers. |
| RRC Signaling                | Signaling intensity is expected to increase due to extra number                                     of RRC reconfigurations. Those configurations start and stop                                     measurements on the UEs and the increased number of received                                     measurement reports.                                                                                                                     |

# 3 Feature Operation of Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

By using hit rate estimation, this feature automatically and dynamically determines and

configures those neighbor relations that each source cell can use for load

management.

Hit-rate is defined as the likelihood of a UE candidate in the source cell, which is

qualified for load balancing or offload to a certain target cell. Hit-rate reflects the

target cell coverage regarding UE density and distribution in the source cell, rather

than the geographical overlap. Target cells that cover high-density areas in the source

cell are better suited for load balancing or offload than target cells that cover

low-density areas. UE measurement is used to estimate the hit-rate value for each target

cell.

The resulting hit-rate for each cell relation is compared to reference thresholds to

decide whether load balancing or offload to this target cell is allowed. The output of

the feature is the updated EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing MO

attribute when that is applicable. This result is then used in the Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing or Inter-Frequency Offload features.

Operational Process

To estimate the hit-rate value for each target cell, various UEs in the source cell

must be measured on target frequencies.

Measurements initiated for load management can be used to estimate the hit-rate. When

the number of measurements is not enough, extra measurements are initiated to feed

the hit-rate estimation.

The resulting hit-rate for each cell relation is compared to reference thresholds to

decide whether load balancing, or offload, or both are allowed to that particular

target cell.

If the hit-rate for an EUTRAN neighbor relation exceeds LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranAddThreshold,

the relation is considered suitable for load management. If the hit-rate is lower

than LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranRemoveThreshold,

the cell relation is not considered suitable.

Management

## 3.1 Disabling Inter-Frequency Measurements Based on ASGH

Inter-frequency measurements with

measurement gap triggered by the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

feature can be disabled in a subscriber group. This results in downlink and uplink

throughput improvement for the UE.

If the UE is in a subscriber group, the inter-frequency measurements with measurement gap

triggered by the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature can be

disabled.

For disabling the measurements, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute must

include the value that corresponds the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load

Management feature name.

With the disabled inter-frequency measurements, the downlink and uplink throughput

improves for the UE since no measurement gap is needed. However, the inter-frequency

neighbor cell relations can be affected negatively because the feature has fewer

measurements for inter-frequency neighbor cell relation estimation.

If the inter-frequency measurement is also enabled for the Inter-Frequency Offload or for

the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, the measurements cannot be disabled for the

Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature even if the conditions are

fulfilled. The reason is that the other load-related features are not affected by the

SON-based measurements management.

# 4 Network Impact of Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

This feature improves throughput by additional UE measurements.

Capacity and Performance

This feature introduces additional inter-frequency UE measurements.  As a result of

this, UE measurements can require a measurement gap depending on UE capability. If

the number of UEs with a measurement gap are increased, the data throughput is

expected to decrease.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011370 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011370 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

Before activating the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature,

either Inter-frequency Load Balancing, or Inter-Frequency Offload, or both must be

configured.

The minimum time it takes to find suitable load balancing relations or remove unsuitable

relations depends on the following:

- The configured LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranMeasUeIntensityTOOLTIPFLAG, for hit-rate estimation. It specifies the number of UE measurements for hit-rate estimation at load balancing cycles per EUTRAN frequency. When load management measurements are ongoing, updating load balancing relations is faster. This is because measurements are also used for hit-rate estimation. To find load balancing relations faster, it is recommended to set the measurement intensity LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranMeasUeIntensityTOOLTIPFLAG to a higher value at feature introduction, especially in networks with non-colocated deployment. The intensity level can be reduced later to reduce the number of measurements.
- The configured thresholds to add or remove load balancing relations. The threshold for adding relations LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranAddThreshold can be reduced to add relations faster. Consider a minimum difference of 5-10% between thresholds LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranAddThreshold and LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranRemoveThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG. To prevent the removal of load balancing relations, it is possible to set the threshold for removing relations LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranRemoveThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG to 0. Note: When the Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature is activated the Best Neighbor Relations feature gets updated with the required capability to give faster and more adaptive hit-rate estimations. Depending on the configuration of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranAddThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG and LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranRemoveThreshold MO attributes, more frequent updates on the EUTranCellRelation.loadBalancing parameter (including corresponding AVC notifications) can be experienced. It is recommended to have at least 10% gap between the thresholds above.
- The configured threshold for starting hit-rate measurements of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateEutranMeasUeThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG MO attribute is required to allow initiation of UE measurements for hit-rate estimation on EUTRAN. This MO attribute specifies the minimum number of connected users in the source cell.
- The number of connected UEs in the source cell, UE distribution and UE capabilities. If there are enough RRC-connected UEs in the source cell, it is expected that a suitable target cell for load management is found within hours.
- The number of defined frequency relations with EUTranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy not set to NOT\_ALLOWED. The EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy MO attribute is configurable for frequency relation. The attribute specifies how the loadBalancing attribute of cell relations during the frequency relation must be updated by this feature. If the EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy is configured to NOT\_ALLOWED for a frequency relation, no UE measurements for hit-rate estimation can be initiated on the frequency. Any other setting of EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy than NOT\_ALLOWED indicate that UE measurements for hit-rate estimation must be initiated on EUTRAN frequencies. If many defined frequency relations for load management exist, the hit-rate estimation pace can be reduced.
