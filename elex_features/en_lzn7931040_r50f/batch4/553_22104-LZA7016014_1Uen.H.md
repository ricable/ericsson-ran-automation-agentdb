Summary

The Restricted Drive Test feature enables the operator to over-ride checking for user consent

when collecting measurements using the Minimization of Drive Tests feature. Such

measurements can include personal data.

Privacy and legal concerns dictate that collection of personal data requires user consent.

Accordingly, the Restricted Drive Test feature has restricted availability, and it

is only available by special request. Conditions for use have to comply with one of

the following use cases:

- Requested for MDT trials with test UEs for a short duration, not longer than two months.
- Requested by customer personnel with suitable authority, who provides notice that the country does not have laws that govern the requirement for user consent. The request must be renewed annually.
- Requested by customer personnel with suitable authority, who provides notice that the legal obligation for user consent is secured by other means. However, they do not implement user consent in their core network. The request must be renewed annually.

# 2 Dependencies of Restricted Drive Test

There are no known

limitations or network requirements. The Minimization of Drive Tests feature is a

prerequisite.

Prerequisites

- Minimization of Drive Tests feature is active.
- The license key is installed on the node.

Steps

1. 1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in theFeatureState=CXC4012162 MO instance.

After performing this step, Minimization of Drive Tests feature does not check for

user consent when collecting measurements.

# 8 Deactivate Restricted Drive Test

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.
