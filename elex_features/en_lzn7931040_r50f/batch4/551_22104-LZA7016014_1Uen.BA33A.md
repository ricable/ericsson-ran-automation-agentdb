Summary

When two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, PIM signals can occur. PIM signals created by downlink carriers can

interfere with signals transmitted by uplink carriers.

This feature detects PIM-originated interference within the same eNodeB or between

the local eNodeB and external nodes in one of the following combinations:

- Up to two eNodeBs
- Up to two gNodeBs
- One eNodeB and one gNodeB

The PIM-originated interference is mapped into victim and aggressor groups, which

provides the following benefits:

- Ability to detect PIM on suspected cells chosen by the system as potentially affected by PIM, either as victim or aggressor.
- Information produced on detected aggressors for each identified victim cell.

# 2 Dependencies of LTE PIM Detection

The accuracy of the results provided by this feature can be affected by the presence

of other active features.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE PIM Detection

This feature introduces the PIM detection function for Baseband Radio Nodes in LTE.

The PIM detection function acts as a diagnostic tool in analyzing PIM

interference.

When two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, it is possible that the two signals create Passive Intermodulation

(PIM). PIM signals created by downlink carriers can interfere with signals transmitted

by uplink carriers. The feature categorizes carriers and cells for diagnostic purposes

in the following ways:

| Aggressor   |    | A downlink cell whose frequency undergoes intermodulation that results in                             unwanted frequency components that spread and interfere with cell                             transmissions.   |
|-------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Victim      |    | An uplink cell that is affected by interference created through                             intermodulation.                                                                                                         |

Figure 1 shows an example of PIM third order

intermodulation spectra for Baseband 25 (1940 MHz Tx and 1980 MHz Tx), 10 MHz

Bandwidth carriers.

Figure 1   Third Order PIM Spectrum Impacting 1900 MHz

The feature detects interference and maps it into victim-aggressor groups. PIM

interference can be caused by a single, dual, triple, or more carriers. These are then

identified as single, dual, triple, and so on downlink aggressor cells. In this feature,

only dual aggressors are subject to detection.

Table 2 shows an example of

possible dual aggressor combinations in a six-cell configuration.

Table 2   Aggressor Combinations

| Cell1+Cell2   | Cell1+Cell3   | Cell1+Cell4   | Cell1+Cell5   | Cell1+Cell6   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Cell2+Cell3   | Cell2+Cell4   | Cell2+Cell5   | Cell2+Cell6   | Cell3+Cell4   |
| Cell3+Cell5   | Cell3+Cell6   | Cell4+Cell5   | Cell4+Cell6   | Cell5+Cell6   |

The feature collects load measurements and interference data for 24 hours for all

selected victim-aggressor groups for PIM detection. To measure victim-aggressor

dependencies, the feature considers load measurements and interference for each analyzed

cell.

Downlink PRB usage for load measurements is calculated using the following formulas:

- Total downlink PRB usage = Downlink PRB usage for LTE cell + Downlink PRB usage for MI cell + Downlink PRB usage for ESS cell + Downlink PRB usage for Air Interface Load Generator
- Downlink PRB Utilization with ESS configured = Total downlink PRB usage / (Available downlink PRBs for ESS cell + Available downlink PRBs for guard band NB-IoT cell)
- Downlink PRB Utilization without ESS configured = Total downlink PRB usage / (Available downlink PRBs for LTE cell + Available downlink PRBs for guard band NB-IoT cell)

For

more information

on

load measurement counters, see Performance of LTE PIM

Detection.

The uplink interference power is retrieved from the

EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwr PM counter, reported by

the Baseband Radio Node. The most important cells to detect and analyze are the cells

with a PIM interference power of -112 dBm and above. PIM interference power values are

categorized into the following bins:

- ]-112, ..., -108]
- ]-108, ..., -104]
- ]-104, ..., -100]
- ]-100, ..., -96]
- ]- 96, ..., -92]
- ]-92, ...]

The bins contain the number of samples for the measured noise and interference power.

After 24 hours, the system uses the collected data to calculate the correlation between

load measurements and interference to predict PIM impact. The PIM

detection results are shown by the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT PM event and the

EUtranCellFDD.pimDetectionStatus attribute on the victim

cell.

The INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT PM event contains

information

for up to 21 dual

aggressors, therefore, each event parameter has 21 occurrences. Event parameter

occurrences are matched to each cell of dual aggressors.

For more information on the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT

event, see Performance of LTE PIM Detection.

Operational Process

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram of LTE PIM Detection

1. Candidate cells for PIM detection are identified based on configuration.
2. The victim-aggressor group is selected for PIM detection based on the configuration. The victim-aggressor group is the basic unit of PIM detection and consists of one victim cell and dual aggressor cells.
3. PIM detection is performed for the selected victim-aggressor groups.

The feature does not require manual activation, but PIM detection must be enabled.

PIM detection is enabled using the

ENodeBFunction.pimDetectionEnabled attribute.

## 3.1 Victim-Aggressor Group Selection

The selection of victim-aggressor groups in the feature requires the following types of

cells:

- Operable cells
- External Ericsson cells that support the LTE PIM Detection feature

The feature uses the selected cells in the following way:

- Local cells are used as either victim or aggressor cells as well.
- External cells are used only as aggressor cells. Note: To include external cells in victim-aggressor groups, external nodes must be selected by configuring the ExternalENodeBFunction.pimDetectionRemoteSelected attribute or the ExternalGNodeBFunction.pimDetectionRemoteSelected attribute depending on the external node type. For further information, see Configure External Node Selection.

The feature selects victim-aggressor groups in the following way:

1. All possible victim-aggressor groups are built as candidate groups, consisting of selected victim and aggressor cells.
2. If there are multiple candidate groups with the same victim and aggressor cells but different intermodulation orders, only the candidate group with the highest priority is kept. The candidate groups are prioritized based on the intermodulation order from high to low: IM3 &gt; IM5 &gt; IM2 &gt; IM4.
3. The potential PIM overlap ratio is calculated for all candidate groups. The PIM overlap ratio is the uplink frequency range of the victim cell that is overlapped with potential PIM caused by dual aggressor cells.
4. Candidate groups with zero potential PIM overlap ratio are removed.
5. Up to 936 of the candidate groups are selected in order of potential PIM overlap ratio.
6. Based on the selected victim-aggressor groups, the attribute values described in Table 3 and Table 4 are set.

Events

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT The results of PIM detection are reported every 24 hours through the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT event on the victim cell. Event Event Parameter Description INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_TYPE Lists the type of detected PIM victim-aggressor relation, which can be one of the following: EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_TYPE\_CLEAR\_AGGRESSOR\_PAIR EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_TYPE\_LIKELY\_AGGRESSOR\_PAIR EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_TYPE\_NO\_PIM EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_INTERFERENCE\_PWR Lists the estimated PIM interference power for the cell. EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_DETECTION\_RELIABILITY Reports the confidence metric of PIM measurements. This metric represents the reliability of the acquired results. If PIM type is indicated as CLEAR, reliability is always 5. If PIM type is indicated as LIKELY, reliability can range from 0 to 3. If PIM type is indicated as NO PIM, reliability can be either 5 or 1. In this case, 5 indicates that no aggressor is detected, and 1 indicates that too many aggressors are detected. EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_1\_TYPE Lists the type of PIM aggressor cell in the perspective, which can be one of the following: EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_LOCAL\_AGGRESSOR EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_REMOTE\_LTE\_AGGRESSOR EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_REMOTE\_NR\_AGGRESSOR EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_2\_TYPE EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_1\_PLMN\_ID Lists the PLMN ID of PIM aggressor cell. EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_2\_PLMN\_ID EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_1\_NODE\_ID Lists the node ID of PIM aggressor cell. EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_2\_NODE\_ID EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_1\_CELL\_ID Lists the cell ID of PIM aggressor cell. EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_AGGRESSOR\_2\_CELL\_ID EVENT\_ARRAY\_INTERMODULATION\_LEVEL Lists the intermodulation level of PIM victim-aggressor. Note: If EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_TYPE indicates EVENT\_VALUE\_PIM\_TYPE\_NO\_PIM, the feature can report EVENT\_ARRAY\_PIM\_DETECTION\_RELIABILITY set to 1 even if the victim cell is expected to have PIM issues. This is a false-positive prevention mechanism, which indicates that an aggressor is unable to be clearly identified because of too many detected aggressors. That is, more than half of the total number of aggressors are detected.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## 7.1 Enable PIM Detection

The PIM detection function must be enabled with the

ENodeBFunction.pimDetectionEnabled attribute.

The feature does not require manual activation, but the PIM detection function must

be enabled. The PIM detection function is governed by the value of the

ENodeBFunction.pimDetectionEnabled attribute. The following

process configures local cells for PIM detection. For more information on

configuring external nodes for PIM detection, see Configure External Node Selection.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for LTE PIM Detection

The feature enables the detection of PIM-originated interference, and

maps

it onto victim-aggressor groups.

The system automatically selects suspected PIM victims or PIM aggressors on the node

level. The result can be observed through the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.pimDetectionRole
- ExternalGUtranCell.pimDetectionRole
- ExternalEUtranCellFDD.pimDetectionRole

## 8.1 Configure External Node Selection

The selection of external nodes can be enabled through attributes under the

ExternalENodeBFunction MO class.

External nodes can be selected by configuring the

ExternalENodeBFunction.pimDetectionRemoteSelected attribute

or the ExternalGNodeBFunction.pimDetectionRemoteSelected

attribute. If

external nodes are not selected, the LTE PIM Detection feature only considers

victim-aggressor groups within the local eNodeB.

If an external node is selected, the load measurement is reported to the local eNodeB

to enable the selection of external cells as aggressors.

Steps

1. Perform one of the following actions based on the external node types: Node Type Process eNodeB Set the ExternalENodeBFunction.pimDetectionRemoteSelected attribute to true. gNodeB Set the ExternalGNodeBFunction.pimDetectionRemoteSelected attribute to true. Note: Up to two external nodes can be selected. Only Ericsson eNodeBs and gNodeBs are supported.

## 8.2 Configure PIM Events

PIM events can be configured using the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT PM event.

The INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT PM event is not

included by default in the PM event scanner.

Prerequisites

Both the LTE PIM Detection feature and the victim cell must be enabled.

Steps

1. Create a PM event scanner. Note: To create a PM event scanner, the state of the PmJob and EventJob MOs needs to be checked. For more information on PM jobs, see Manage Performance.
2. Select an EventJob MO instance where the EventJob.currentJobState and the EventJob.requestedJobState attributes have the value STOPPED.
3. Set the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT PM event in the selected EventJob MO instance.
4. Set the EventJob.currentJobState attribute to ACTIVE.
5. Check the status of the PM event scanner.

Results

The INTERNAL\_EVENT\_PIM\_MEASUREMENTS\_REPORT PM event is visible

in the Recording Output Period (ROP) every 24 hours.
