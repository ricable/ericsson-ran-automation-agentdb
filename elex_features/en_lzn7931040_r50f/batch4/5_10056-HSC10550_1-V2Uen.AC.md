# 1 Introduction

This document describes characteristics that meet the requirements

for LTE (Long Term Evolution) backhaul and recommendations of the

most important properties.

In LTE, the basic system has fewer stringent backhaul requirements

than previous technologies. The focus of this document is the LTE

backhaul, from the Ethernet interface on the LTE Digital Unit (DU) or Baseband in the RBS (Radio Base Station),

the evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (LTE E-UTRAN) NodeB known as the

eNodeB, to the core network site.

This document includes recommendations for the following:

- Delay, also known as latency
- Packet size
- Packet Loss
- Network Synchronization
- Bandwidth
- Burst Robustness

# 2 Differences between LTE, GSM, and WCDMA

In the current 3GPP mobile systems, Global System for Mobile (GSM)

communication and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA),

have similar Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture: the Base Transceiver

Station (BTS) in GSM and the Radio Base Station (RBS) (NodeB) in WCDMA

and the common control nodes, the Base Station Controller (BSC) and

the Radio Network Controller (RNC) respectively.

As a result of the architectural evolution of LTE defined in 3rd

Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, the common control

functions are moved to the RBSs and core network nodes, creating a

RAN that consists of a single node type, the LTE RBS.  Table 1 compares the nodes for

the different access technologies.

| Technology   | RBS   | Control Node   |
|--------------|-------|----------------|
| GSM          | BTS   | BSC            |
| WCDMA        | RBS   | RNC            |
| LTE          | RBS   | Not applicable |

For GSM and WCDMA, the terms "RAN transport" and "RAN backhaul" normally refer to the transport network between

the BSC and Radio Network Controller (RNC) control nodes and the RBSs

on the Abis (interface between BSC &amp; MSC) and Iub (interface between

the RNC &amp; NodeB) interfaces. The higher level interfaces are handled

in core network transport.

For LTE with its simpler architecture, the RAN transport between

RBSs and the core network, and between RBSs on S1 (northbound interface

on eNB) and X2 (interface to neighbor eNodeB) respectively, comprises

RAN transport.

The Abis, Iub, S1, and X2 interfaces include both control signaling

and mobile traffic payload. Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) traffic

to the RBSs normally uses the same transmission as Abis, Iub, and

S1.

Figure 1 shows a comparison of 3GPP Radio

Access Technologies (RAT).

## 2.1 WCDMA Architecture

In WCDMA, several functions have delay requirements, for example,

soft handover, macro-diversity combination, power control, scheduling,

network synchronization, and frequency stability. Apart from frequency

stability, the WCDMA functions are split between the RNC and the RBS

due to distributed functions on layer 1 (physical) and layer 2 (RLC).

The RBS does not include layer 2. RNC handles all functions on layer

2. The result of this is that delay-sensitive functions and transmission

delay requirements in WCDMA are put on the backhaul.

## 2.2 LTE Architecture

In LTE, the layer 2 functions are moved to the RBS, which results

in fewer strict requirements. Delay-sensitive functions are located

in the RBS only.

The LTE system (rather than application) requirements, currently

identified to drive backhaul time-related performance, are as follows:

- Inter-RBS handover, further described in Section 3.2.1
- Packet-based network synchronization support, further described in Section 5

## 2.3 TCP introduction

In any Internet-related system, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

is a dominating protocol that provides connectivity. It will often

be referred to in this document. This section is to give a brief overview.Details

follow in subsequent sections.

### 2.3.1 TCP mechanisms

The IP suite supports the following two main transfer modes:

- TCP, which is connection-oriented has session IDs, delivers packets in a certain order and detects and retransmits lost packets. Most of the traffic in Internet is TCP-based. Retransmissions are discovered and handled by the TCP protocol.
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is connection-less and unaware of possible packet loss has no flow control, hence will never back off and is therfore seen as aggressive. UDP is used in the RAN, to support mobility.

TCP is suitable for all types of error-sensitive or non-real-time

data transfers, such as web or mail or both while UDP is more apt

for less error-sensitive, real-time services, such as voice. Streaming

applications, which may be described as error-sensitive, often use

TCP to solve the firewall traversal problem and use play-out buffers

to solve the resulting delay problem, a non-real-time problem. Some

applications use UDP because of its simplicity and add application-specific

error recovery and other features. However, in general Internet traffic

today, the volume of TCP connectivity is much larger than that of

UDP.

TCP uses control throughput via the window size, which is the maximum

amount of data sent. Two methods are used to adjust the window size

in response to network conditions: slow start and congestion avoidance.

The increase is exponential for slow start and lessens in the congestion

avoidance phase. TCP starts in the slow start mode and changes between

the two modes in response to loss detections, such as time-out and

retransmission. Loss detection by retransmission time-out means that

slow start is used again. If the loss is detected when the window

size reaches half the size, the mode typically changes to congestion

avoidance.

TCP can detect packet loss in the network by detecting duplicate

acknowledgements. TCP assumes that the cause of this is that some

recently sent packets were lost, hence it responds by halving its

rate, that is the window or number of unacknowledged packets and by

setting the mode to congestion avoidance.

The TCP mechanism was designed to handle varying traffic, that

is user input variations, which are supposed to cause buffer overflows

but this also applies to other variations, such as varying bandwidth,

that is radio condition variations that tend to cause delays rather

than losses. Although TCP attempts to account for such delay variations,

the result may be spurious retransmissions. Typical congestion packet

loss values are shown in  Figure 5. Packet loss due to errors, for example CRC error should always

be much less than congestion packet loss, that is 1/100. Congestion

packet loss is part of the congestion control in TCP and is the method

used to optimize the file download time. Retransmissions are made

from the client but do not reduce the file download time if the bottleneck

buffers always have large enough packets to deliver. The most frequent

problem is buffers that are too small, that is some buffer in the

path becomes empty and must wait for new packets to go forward. Good

knowledge of the network is required to know where the bottleneck

is, especially as it may change over time.

Because interactive applications are expected to use TCP, RFC 1323 TCP, Extensions for High Performance is

a good source of delay performance analysis.

### 2.3.2 TCP Parameters

Table 2 lists the important

parameters in the complex TCP protocol. The list is an overview that

includes all possible important parameters between the terminal device

and the Internet server. There are still more issues that impact the

TCP throughput not included in this level of details. Round Trip Time

(RTT) is often mentioned in this document, which in real networks

it varyies a lot, as the distance to the server could vary which causes

large differences in RTT. The default value used in many cases is

100 ms.

| Parameter                 | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File length               | Longer files tend to reduce download time per data unit. The transmission rate of TCP is based on probing and gradual increase. Short files can be completed before the transmission rate increases to its full potential, so they experience a lower average throughput. Operators can do nothing about this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RTT                       | The most important parameter. Shorter RTTs tend to reduce download time of small files. For large files and a buffered link the download time becomes less dependent on RTT. Operators are advised to adjust buffer size and avoid slow links, such as low bandwidth or congested links, as well as high-delay links, such as satellites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Packet size               | Larger packets tend to reduce  file download time. The packet size is defined when the TCP connection is set up as the largest segment acceptable to all links of the end-to-end path. A typical limit may be set by the maximum size of Ethernet frames (1,522 bytes included p- and Q-bits). In practice, operators are advised to avoid links that impose hard limitations on packet sizes. The consequence is that fragmentation and reassembly has to be made or additional data may have to be retransmitted in the case of packet loss. The packet size includes the headers, checksum, and padding. Section  7 provides more information. |
| Initial  window size      | Larger initial windows tend to reduce the file download time. The value refers to the protocol implementation at the sending end. A large window fills buffers in the path more quickly and may cause more packet loss and increase the risk of retransmission timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Receiver window size      | Larger receiver windows tend to reduce  file download time. The value refers to the protocol implementation at the receiving end. The best result is achieved if the size of the sending window and the receiving window is the same. Early implementations used values between 4 and 16 kbytes, but more recent implementations use dynamic scaling. Operators are advised to help users tune their TCP implementations. The smallest size needed to fill the buffers in the path is RTT ×transmission rate but the recommendation is at least 2×RTT×transmission rate.                                                                          |
| Window scaling            | Window scaling is an extension of TCP that reduces file download time. Window scaling extends the range of the receiver window beyond the limit of 64 kbytes. Typically it is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Delayed  acknow ledgments | Delayed acknowledgements tend to influence file download time negatively. In TCP the number of acknowledgments may be halved by delaying acknowledgements for a certain time period or until a second packet arrives. The option is only beneficial in some cases with small buffers in the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Buffer size               | To achieve the shortest possible file download time, all nodes in the network must have buffer sizes large enough to always ensure they have packets to send but not too large to cause delay. A recommended buffer size is 3 ×link speed ×RTT in links with a small number of sessions, that is, a small degree of statistical multiplexing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Figure 2 shows the parameters that control

the TCP properties as described in  Table 2. In the application level file

length is the dominant factor, whereas at the operating system level

the buffer size, window size and packet size scaling are dominant

factors. A network property is RTT. Packet loss is not shown in  Figure 2, however it is an important reason for bad

throughput in a real network. Packet loss may be caused in any part

of a network. The only packet loss that is valid is the buffer overflow

that is needed for TCP flow control.

Packets out of order may

be perceived as lost packets and cause bad throughput. Any link aggregation

or equal pathing must always be configured to keep the packets within

one session in one physical path. It is often a possible to share

capacity at the packet level but that option always causes problems

with packets out of order, which may cause TCP to order retransmission

and subsequent window size reduction.

Figure 2   TCP Parameters Overview

In summary, the target is to reduce download time, that is, to

optimize bandwidth. This method makes it possible for the sender to

send as much as possible, that is to fill bottleneck buffers on the

path to the receiver with only marginal packet loss.

# 3 LTE Backhaul Delay

Network delay impacts the performance of user applications, for

example voice and real-time video and system functions such as packet-based

synchronization and handover. This section analyzes the factors that

influence network delay and how it in turn impacts user applications

and the LTE system function.

## 3.1 Transport Delay Factors

End-user sessions may experience delays caused by several factors.

These include server delay, client device or terminal delay, application

software delay, firewall or Security Gateway (SEG) delay, pacing,

that is sending packets in a steady flow rather than as bursty traffic,

air interface, and transport (backhaul-related) delay. Delay that

is introduced in the air interface can be scheduled in two ways, either

scheduling or buffering. Scheduling entails waiting for the best radio

conditions whereas buffering entails waiting in a queue because there

are many packets to send.

Transport delay is in turn caused by several factors as follows:

- Propagation delay that can be roughly calculated based on path distance and the speed of the signal in the media. Various physical media, such as fiber or copper impact the propagation delay.
- Device delay is the delay introduced by intermediary network devices such as routers, switches, SEGs, and radio equipment.
- Congestion-related delay that is introduced when network devices are forced to buffer packets because the throughput requirements exceed the available throughput capacity.
- Delay in the SEG because of firewall actions or encryption/decryption processing.

With the exception of the first transport delay factor, the other

factors constitute variable delay based on network use and the number

of active network users.

The following assumptions are made for path propagation delay:

- The propagation speed of light in optical fibers is approximately 300 km/ms.
- The propagation speed of electrical signals in copper wires is 200 km/ms.
- For Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), an extra modem delay of 5-15 ms is added on top of the propagation delay.
- A general assumption for the maximum distance from RBS to core nodes is 2,000 km, which is equivalent to 10 ms propagation delay in case of electrical signals in copper wires. This assumption is based on a concept that in a large country such as the US, there are at least two core nodes that are equally spread geographically. References for distance examples are the following:
    - For metro distances, less than 150 km, see Reference [6].
    - For national or continental distances less than 4,000 km and global or intercontinental distances less than 17,000 km, see Reference [4].
- Device delay, that is the processing time, is negligible in modern transport network equipment when there is no congestion. This assumption only applies to transport network equipment, not to radio network equipment, such as RBSs or core nodes.

Estimated acceptable congestion-related delay levels can be calculated

based on the application delay budget, the average propagation delay,

and other known delays that are not transport-related. All applications

have network performance parameters and budgets for optimizing end-user

experience. Application delay budgets can be used to estimate transport

delay budgets.

Figure 3 shows possible input to delay calculation

at application level by considering the criteria that are valid in

the operator's network. The best case is 2 ms scheduling at low traffic,

for example when the user is alone in the network. The worst case

may be up to 80 ms scheduling that includes a waiting period in the

buffer for a user when the maximum number of users is reached. However,

better or worse results can be achieved by implementing and configuring

QoS in different ways. The worst case one-way end-to-end is approximately

210 ms. The typical session however is held between an LTE user and

a server in the Internet, such as when downloading a web page. In

that case, the delay figures are very difficult to estimate. The distances

are totally unknown as the server may be anywhere in the world, as

depicted in  Figure 4.

The delay figures may be seen as examples for calculation of Round

Trip Time (RTT) for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Any TCP-based

application suffers from high RTT values, so does the feedback that

controls the increase of window size. The influence is reduced in

file transfer of large files.  Figure 5 shows TCP algorithm results for different packet loss values for

a single TCP new Reno flow. Several other TCP alternatives exist but

are not reported here. The RTT shown is the total RTT, that is the

terminal TCP-termination delay is included. To reach 100 Mpbs throughput

for example, a total RTT of less than 100 ms and a packet loss lower

than 10-6 must be fulfilled. However packet loss (Section  4) is the main reason in real networks for reduced

TCP throughput. If there are many TCP flows, file download time decrease

is expected due to a statistically more efficient use of buffers.

The TCP algorithm is complex and many factors impact the resulting

file download time as described in Reference [5].

### 3.1.1 Voice and Delay

Voice delay requirements are specified in 3GPP

TS22.105 v8.4.0, Appendix B2.1 Performance Requirements for Conversational

Realtime. The 3GPP recommendation is split into three levels,

whereas the ITU G.114 graph has five levels as shown in  Figure 6, therefore the limits are not the same. The 3GPP

limit for acceptable delay is 400 ms. The average delay in an LTE

system is within the limits for satisfied users in both classification

systems.

Figure 6 shows Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values

for the mouth-to-ear delay versus experienced voice quality for telephony.

Here the transport delay must be added to coder and decoder delays

and even some Gateway (GW) processing may be necessary, for example

30-50 ms. The total one-way delay may then be approximately

56-300 ms, which will satisfy users. Every network must be analyzed

separately. Codecs and GWs cause delay and show whether most calls

are made between two mobile User Equipment (UE) or between mobile

and fixed UE where there is no scheduling in B-part that can also

affect delay. It is necessary to consider scheduling reduction, that

is fewer subscribers for each RBS or distribution of servers if very

long delays are experienced.

### 3.1.2 Delay Recommendations

3GPP TS 23.203 provides recommendations

that allocate a subset of the end-to-end performance budget to the

backhaul network between the eNodeB and Policy and Charging Enforcement

Function (PCEF), which is usually at the same position as the Packet

Data Network Gateway (PGW) as shown in  Figure 7. Here it is assumed

that an average of 20 ms of the end-to-end one-way budget is consumed

by the backhaul for small and large networks as specified in Reference [1].  Ericsson recommends that the backhaul network

be designed not to impose congestion-related delay for high priority

traffic.

Figure 7   Scope of Standardized QCI Characteristics for Client Server

Communication

The transport network must therefore be configured in such a way

that high priority traffic does not experience additional delay to

the propagation delay in the network. Based on the assumption outlined

in Section  3.1, a small network

will have average delays values of 1 ms in the backhaul portion and

3 ms in the backbone. All figures in this section show one-way traffic.

In large networks, the delays may be 10 ms and 20 ms respectively.

Backbone and backhaul figures are not separated in the 3GPP reference.

The small and large network delays are 10 ms and 50 ms compared with

Ericsson backhaul + backbone + backhaul figures for small and large

networks respectively: 1+3+1 and 10+20+10. The figures are summarized

in  Table 3 and column "Total

Delay" includes scheduling and doubled backhaul delay to account

for a path between two mobile devices.

### 3.1.3 Delay and QoS in Backhaul

In a perfect network, Quality of Service (QoS) should never be

needed. A perfect network manages the load without any other delay

than propagation and has no packet loss. It will arise if traffic

encounter links with too low capacity, then the RTT time will increase

as the buffer fills and eventually packet loss will occur and TCP

reduce the window size. A new stepwise increase of window size starts

up to new packet loss and so on in a cyclic behavior. This sawtooth

profile of delay is a typical sign of a capacity issue in the network.

If buffers are too large the end-user will experience excessive delay

as TCP will be slow in reducing window size (phenomen called bufferbloat).

In general packet loss shall be avoided with higher capacity not larger

buffers.

Other situations when delay becomes too high maybe after

a link break. . QoS is then used to discard packets in a predefined

priority order. In congestion conditions, high priority traffic encounters

the lowest delay and the operator must determine the quality level

to apply to each service.

Transport Network Configuration provides the recommended

QoS settings.

### 3.1.4 Ericsson RBS Delay Estimate

The delay caused by processing user traffic passing through an

RBS is estimated to be lower than 4 ms in the Downlink (DL) and slightly

lower in the Uplink (UL). The values include minimum scheduling but

not queuing time, which may make a much larger contribution to delay

because of poor radio environment or high usage, that is, many users

or large data volumes. The delay estimate includes IPsec.

The UL estimate includes the time when the last bit in the packet

arrives from the UTRAN-UE Interface (Uu) air interface to the time

when the first bit in the packet is transmitted on the S1 interface.

The DL includes the time when the last bit on the S1 user plane is

received in the RBS until the first bit is transmitted on the Uu interface

towards the air interface. The values are estimated on the physical

layer for a loaded condition of 150 Mbps DL and 50 Mbps UL using the

User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

## 3.2 Handover
and X2 Delay

The main delay requirement for the LTE backhaul is related to X2

handover. The recommended delay targets for handover avoid delays

noticeable to the end-user.

| Backhaul path propagation delay                                       | Backhaul path propagation delay is as follows:  Path propagation delay is the travel time for the light pulse through the fiber. A distance of a maximum of 150 km, that is, maximum 1 ms is assumed for the X2 path propagation. Section  3.1 provides references.  Routers, switches, or microwave terminals processing delay generally operate at a much lower level than 1 ms, hence, routers or switches that are not congested cause negligible delay.  Dimensioning andqueuing in routers or switches during congestion cause delay, which occurs when link capacity is too low . It is strongly recommended that the network is dimensioned to manage at least peak load of Guaranteed Bitrate (GBR) services such as voice, hence, queueing in routers or switches should never occur unless there is an extreme situation with link failure or some similar malfunction.  The impact from transport-induced delay will have a greater impact in the future when node-related delays are reduced. On average, the transport delay may represent up to 15% of the handover interruption time during handover when signaling and network design is optimized. Today it is estimated to account for approximately 5%. |                                                                       |

Two signaling processes are associated to handover delay as follows:

- Main handover signaling
- Setting of T304, described in Section 3.2.3)

On a high level, main handover signaling must be performed before

the UE moves into an area where it is unreachable. Depending on the

type of application used at the time of handover, speed variations

to complete handover can exist i. The UE speed and the application

performance expected also influences the delay requirements for X2.

### 3.2.1 X2
Handover Procedure

The X2 handover procedure can be divided into four stages as described

in  Table 4.

| 1. Evaluation  | UE measurements and measurement report analysis is ongoing. X2 is not involved. Success depends on the UE speed on moving into poorer radio conditions and away from the source RBS while reports from the UE and analysis of the values in the source RBS are ongoing. Radio link failure may be triggered by the UE or RBS before the UE sends and the RBS receives a measurement report that triggers handover preparation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2. Preparation | The source RBS requests resources from the target RBS. This stage includes control signaling over X2 between the source and the target RBS to check and allocate target resource availability for the UE connection. Shorter delay means better handover performance. Given enough coverage, the signaling procedure can tolerate a round-trip delay of up to a couple of hundred milliseconds without causing significant increase in failures, for example, the delay between sending a handover request and receiving the handover request response to and from the target RBS. Within LTE, intrafrequency handovers are generally made faster than interfrequency handovers to another type of radio technology .   If the X2 round-trip delay is great and the UE is moving at high speed, the UE could lose contact with the source RBS due to increasingly poor radio conditions which results in failure to send handover commands to the UE as well as possible call drop. Different propagation conditions cause handover performance to be more or less sensitive to this delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3. Execution   | Handover sent to the UE from the source RBS. The UE connects to the target RBS.   This stage puts stricter delay requirements on X2.   A race condition exists between the following:    The time taken for the UE to terminate contact with the source RBS,for example, starting with the handover command and for the UE to move to the target RBS in a state ready for receiving user data. This communication is made over air interfaces.    The time taken for the source RBS to transfer the SN(1) status transfer signal to the target RBS over X2 and for the target RBS to reach a state ready for data transmission.      An unacknowledged, less secure mode exists where ciphering counters are restarted but this method is seldom applied. Where X2 path propagation delay is irrelevant, all handover messages are sent through the UE by radio.   The minimum time required by a UE with good performance is expected to be 30–50 ms. It comprises the move from the source RBS to a state ready for receiving user data in the target RBS in very good radio conditions and no load.(2)   When X2 transfer exceeds this time, a delay is added to the overall handover execution procedure.   The impact of the delay depends on the application active at the time of handover. For the most delay-sensitive applications, a one-way delay over X2 of up to 50–70 ms is probably not noticeable, for example for VoIP(3).(4) The shortest foreseen UE preparation time is 15 ms. Any X2 path propagation time shorter than that never reduces handover interruption time. Typically, the preparation time is about 50 ms in the current system. To attain short handover interrupt times, the SCTP(5) bundling must also be optimized and set differently in low or high traffic load situations. |
| 4. Completion  | The DL data path is switched to the target RBS and resources are released in the source RBS as requested by the target RBS.   For this stage, X2 is involved only for signaling from the target RBS so that the source RBS can release resources. Before DL data is sent to the target RBS from the SGW, a path switch is signaled over the S1 interface. The path switch is used to inform the SGW about the new RBS address and ican include redirection code to direct to the optimal SGW. If packet forwarding is not used, the delay for path switch adds to the interruption time in the DL.(6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

(2)  The values are based on simulations,

estimations of UE processing times, and 3GPP requirements for handover

procedures and conditions. The values may be revised after field testing

is performed.

(3)  Voice over Internet Protocol

(4)  The above delay values indicate what criteria are acceptable for

application sensitivity during handover.

(5)  Stream Control Transmission

Protocol

(6)  A "typical" condition is when the UE is moving at &gt; 30 km through medium sized

cells.

New data delivery on DL can start as soon as path switching has

taken effect. The UL is active after SN status transfer and does not

have to wait for path switching. Data forwarding reduces handover

interrupt time. S1 handover also exists. The same recommendation is

valid for S1 handover. It takes more time as it includes more signalling,

but it is primarily processing rather than transport that causes the

delay.

In conclusion, the LTE system is robust regarding delay on X2 path

propagation. In general, a shorter backhaul delay is better for peak

rates. A backhaul delay of better than 15-70 ms probably makes

no difference for handover in the next 5-10 years. 15 ms refers

to future possible enhancements of control signaling related to the

basic LTE handover process. 70 ms refers to what is possible for the

human ear to notice. Other applications will have other limits.

### 3.2.2 X2 Topology Issue

The delay caused by the X2 path length makes a small contribution

to the overall X2 handover interruption time. In a backhaul with or

without IPsec, the turning point is in the location of the core node

or SEG. This is the Ericsson recommended architecture.

In a routed backhaul with no IPsec, the X2 turning point may be

at the nearest switch or router, as shown in  Figure 8 and  Figure 9. This is an optional

type of architecture. In both hese types of architecture, the path

propagation time is a very small part of the handover interruption

time.

At handover, control signaling passes the backhaul network. If

the signaling procedure experiences too much delay, the system considers

the handover process as failing. The time that elapses until the system

discontinues the handover process can be configured, however but only

by Ericsson personnel. The timer is called T304 in the 3GPP standard

and may be set to the values 100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, 1,000 ms, 2,000

ms, 4,000 ms, and 8,000 ms. The default value is 1,000 ms. 3GPP TS 36.331 v8.3.0 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio

Access (E-UTRA) and Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol specification provides more information.

## 3.3 Video and TV Delay and Bandwidth
Requirements

Many different kinds of services deliver motion pictures. Great

differences exist between streaming services that have buffering devices

in the UE and real-time, and TV services that require low delay. The

main type of impairment that reduces the end-user's experience is

picture freezing. From one study it was concluded that at the maximum

one degradation per 15 min was acceptable, whereas from another study

the tolerance of picture freezing was zero. Neither result is generally

valid for all viewers. Beginners or professional users, content and

culture are factors that influence the end-user quality requirements.

However, the quality level of one freeze per 15 minutes sets a requirement

on the backhaul to provide a throughput that is at least as high as

the encoded video bitrate for at least of 99.9% of the time.

The

throughput requirement could be translated to a delay requirement,

or packet loss requirement. The 99,9% throughput is a throughput with

no delay or packet loss. When the buffer is empty, a freeze occurs.

If packet loss increases from 10-4 to 10-3the TCP control mechanism reduces the throughput from 10 to 2 Mb/s

in an example with typical TCP new Reno implementation and 100ms roundtrip

time. Short congestion periods in the network due to this TCP behavior

can cause frozen screens. See  Figure 10.

Figure 10   Different Phases of Buffer Fill Levels

In streaming video, a buffer in the end-user terminal allows for

some delay. However, conflicting requirements exist on short channel

switching time that requests small buffer sizes, and low risk of freeze

that requires large buffer size. A frequently occurring compromise

is a 1 sec buffer size. Also, if video is delivered over UDP there

is no flow control mechanism but congestion may still reduce the throughput

and result in picture freezing.

To summarize, no direct delay requirements exist for video but

the requirement put on throughput still assumes no delay. The throughput

requirement is dependent on coding. Standard TV (SDTV) encoded with

MPEG2 bitrate must be 4.5Mb/s and encoded with H.264, the bitrate

must be in the range of 1.7-2.5 Mb/s for viewing with a 25Hz frame

rate. Larger screens at the same viewing distance and/or complex scenes

require higher bitrate for the same quality. For example a bitrate

increase up to 5-6 Mb/s is needed for SDTV, H.264 encoding, in cases

with the most complex scenes.

## 3.4 Web Page Download

Web page traffic is often placed in a separate quality of service

class with very low priority. If the network has low capacity, the

end-users will be affected by long download times in the most common

application, websurf. Web page download time depends heavily on factors

outside the transport area. An overview is found in Reference [7]. The most important factors outside transport are as follows: TCP

version, initial window size, sender and receiver properties and web

page build methods, that is, the number and size of objects that constitute

the downloaded object and how they are downloaded.

From the transport

point of view, the RTT and buffer sizes are important. There are several

implementations of TCP. Two common ones are TCP New Reno, which has

two phases, and TCP Cubic. During the TCP initial phase, the slow

start phase, throughput is increased in a system which includes many

round trips. In the second phase, the congestion avoidance phase when

speed is anticipated to be almost optimal, the packet transfer is

slowly adjusted and changes take one RTT to take effect. Hence long

RTT impacts the total download time of a web page in TCP New Reno.

TCP Cubic, another TCP implementation, does not depend on RTT to increase

the size of transmitted traffic volume. Packet loss causes longer

download time not only because of retransmission but mainly because

TCP is made to reduce the packet transmission rate when a loss is

encountered. In bottleneck nodes, the bandwidth throughput capacity

must be enhanced if high packet loss is observed. A solution may be

to increase buffer size. However if it is increased too much, the

increased RTT starts to reduce transmission capacity because of filled

buffers, a phenomena discussed as buffer bloat.  Optimal buffer size

is defined in Section  8.  Figure 5 is a graph of the association

between throughput, packet loss, and RTT.

In conclusion, RTT

and optimal buffer size are the most important transport parameters

that affect websurf experience.

# 4 Packet Loss

In addition to product characteristics, that is, capacity, buffer

size, and burst size), the packet loss rate in a commercial network

depends largely on the network aggregation structure that includes

radio, backbone, and Internet architecture. The radio part of the

network has built-in functions that correct air transmission errors.

These functions are not covered in this document.

Packet loss has been studied in live General Packet Radio Service

(GPRS) and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) network backhaul

parts. The packet loss rate in real networks varies from parts per

million to values as high asseveral percent.

The network properties are important. When designing the network,

real-time properties, such as capacity, buffer size, and burst size

must be meticulously designed, otherwise they can cause poor end-user

experience. Any node in end-to-end transport may impact the performance,

hence a client that downloads a web page from a server on a remote

site may get poor performance caused by packet loss in one single

bad node. The requirement is that all nodes must manage the capacity

and the burst sizes.

The Packet Loss Rate (PLR) can be broken down into the following

two separate types:

- Rate of congestion-related packet loss, that is, packets that get dropped due to a queue exceeding a threshold.
- Rate of non congestion-related packet loss,that is, packets that get lost in transmission, for example, discarded by a link layer receiver due to Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) failure or by loss that occurs at the time of handover.

Note:  In 3GPP TS 23.203 V9.2.0, only  bullet

2 is considered and it is referred to as Packet Error Loss Rate (PELR),

which is only a subset of the PLR. In general the PELR should be less

important or negligible for the mobile backhaul as mentioned in 3GPP

TS 23.203 V9.2.0 except in the case of microwave backhaul.  However

from a service quality point of view, that is end-user quality of

a session/call, packet loss means the total packet loss, as it causes

loss due to congestion.

The Ericsson recommendation is to dimension buffer sizes to reduce

the packet loss rate to 10-6 in general, Reference [1], as this is the design limit for some applications.

In a worst case scenario during busy hours, higher values dependent

on the requested and affordable service quality may be acceptable.

A level of 10-3 will degrade video transmission quality

but is acceptable for voice. For example, if you know the properties

of the bottleneck, you may choose to limit the eNodeB to the same

properties and subsequently get better traffic management tools to

control packet loss. The network may be dimensioned from RTT measurements

which is probably a better solution, but RTT values are generally

more difficult to obtain. The best alternative is to be familiar with

both packet loss and RTT characteristics.

# 5 Network Synchronization

Network synchronization solves the requirement for Uu interface synchronization.

The principle is to synchronize all nodes in the network to a common

high stability synchronization source. Network Synchronization can

be subdivided into frequency synchronization and time synchronization.

If a node is time synchronized, it is also frequency synchronized,

but not the opposite.

TDD requires time synchronization

to not create interference between nodes.

In normal operation, clocks are synchronized

to the PRC. If a clock loses connection to the PRC, it keeps the last

known information it received from the PRC. This is called holdover

mode. To avoid  holdover mode, the synchronization network must be

implemented in redundant structures.

For a general overview

of synchronization methods, see Network Synchronization.

## 5.1 Time and Phase Synchronization Requirements

The time accuracy

requirement for TDD is ± 1.5 microseconds relative to a common

time reference. Some features may require better accuracy. See Fallback from Time and Phase Synchronization.

Time synchronization

requires connectivity to at least one high accuracy time source. The

RBS can use one or a combination of the following methods:

- Synchronization over packets with the PTP.
- Direct connection to an Ericsson GNSS receiver.

Synchronization over

packets with the PTP puts requirements on the Transport Network.

## 5.2 Time and Phase Synchronization
with PTP

A node time synchronized to a PTP reference tolerates:

1. time error at the input to the base station must not exceed 1100ns and the PDV for the 1 % packets with lowest network delay in each direction have a total spread of less than 1 us during any 10s time interval. The distribution could have square or harmonic distribution with a minimum frequency of 1 Hz. Harmonic content in the PDV lower than 1 Hz may not be filtered and is considered to be part of item 3 (time error of the IP network).
2. a time error from the Grand Master of maximum 250 ns. This is given in the clockAccuracy field of the Announce message.
3. a maximum time error in the IP network of 1 000 ns.

Points 2 and 3 together mean that the time in the PTP packet immediately

at the output of the equipment feeding the node must be within the

sum of those time errors excluding jitter.

The followings are prerequisites to meet these requirements:

- PTP is run on the Ethernet layer.
- All nodes between the PTP Grandmaster and the RBS must be so called PTP Telecom Boundary Clocks.

# 6 Bandwidth

In the documentTransport Network Dimensioning section 3.4.1.3

bandwidth capabilities are Tabled for different radio bandwidths and

cell configurations. To obtain the corresponding transport capacity,

transport overhead from tunnels must be considered.

# 7 Packet Size

The size of the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)

can cause a particular problem in mobile RAN systems, as mobile systems

add a tunnel overhead to manage mobility, which increases the packet

size in the RAN. It is important that it is not mistaken for the Non-Access

Stratum (NAS) level MTU which is the end-user MTU on a level above

the RAN as shown in  Figure 11.

The general maximum size of a packet in the Internet is usually

defined by the Ethernet interface: 1,518 bytes, the basic frame size.

The Maximum Segment Size (MSS) packet on egress at TCP-level from

a mobile laptop is 1,460 bytes = typical MTU 1500 - 20 (TCP)

- 20 (IPv4). The RBS adds a GTP-header and a UDP/IP header,

expanding the packet to typically 1,536 bytes (GTP+UDP+IP). Subsequently,

even more headers are added higher up in the network, for example

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is often used in the higher RAN

levels.  Table 5 lists the minimum encapsulation

size of various headers.  Table 6 is an overview

of added headers.

Many transport networks or links cannot handle this size. The

intermediate nodes in this scenario may fragment the packets.

Fragmentation, or rather the reassembly process requires many resources

and causes delays. For reordering incoming fragments, memory overflow

and packet loss may occur. The solution to fragmentation is that the

sender can detect the maximum packet size on a path by using Path

MTU Discovery (PMTUD), RFC 1981. PMTUD is supported for IPv6 in release

L12B. When the new version is available, the sender will be able to

reduce the packet size to fit the network.

To reduce the need for PMTUD, at least two methods are available

as follows:

- Increase the capacity to handle a larger IP MTU. One level supported by standards is 2,000 bytes as described in Reference [3]. In eNodeB the fragmentation/reassembly support is enhanced and it is able to handle packets with a size of up to approximately 2,000 bytes. The maximum size of the Ethernet payload (including IP+TCP but not Ethernet header) allowed is 1996B in IPv4 case and 2000B in IPv6. The support in the network up to this level has to be implemented in all nodes in the RAN up to the Internet gateway to enhance throughput in an efficient way. On the NAS level, the payload in the RAN, the MTU must still be dimensioned at 1,500 bytes for basic frames. The extra size must not be used by the end-user applications.
- If there are nodes in the RAN that do not support large MTUs as regards size or processing capacity, the size and capacity values must be reduced by configuring the NAS level MTU. It is recommended that the MTU size in the UE is configured to a size low enough size to cater for added headers in the following nodes. When applying IPsec, it is especially important to configure the MTU size, as the tunnel overhead is large and fragments and out-of-order packets are more frequent. 3GPP recommends that the UE output should be maximum 1,358 bytes (IPv4 and IPv6), as described in Reference [2]. This is small enough in most of the network deployments and will manage both IPv6 and IPsec headers. Then there is no need for fragmentation or reassembly in the RAN. The same result may be achieved with the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) in TCP protocol clamping in a node in the RAN. A larger UE MTU optimized for the IP transport network may be configured if the network is well known.

Figure 11   MTUs at Different Network Levels

A packet of size 2,000 bytes is called envelope frame by IEEE

802.3. The envelope frame is intended to allow inclusion of additional

prefixes and suffixes required by higher layer encapsulation protocols,

which may use up to 482 octets.

Ethernet implementations must support at least one of three maximum

MAC Client Data field sizes (IEEE 802.3, 3.2.7) defined as follows:

- 1500 decimal: Basic frames
- 1504 decimal: Q-tagged frames
- 1982 decimal: Envelope frames

In DUS 31 and DUS 41 the maximum MTU in IPv4 is MTU = INT ((configured\_MTU

- 20) ÷ 8) × 8 + 20 and in IPv6 MTU = INT (configured

\_MTU ÷ 8) × 8.

# 8 Burst
Robustness

In a mobile system, the traffic is more bursty than in fixed networks.

This is due to the air link having a low signal to noise ratio that

varies to a great extent over time compared to fixed networks. TCP

file download time is sensitive to packet loss, and this sensitivity

increases as the target peak rate increases. For this reason, TCP

traffic must run on a bearer configured with RLC acknowledged mode.

In this mode RLC needs to enforce in-sequence delivery (3GPP TS 36.322 V10.0.0 assumed in several processes). This

is important because also packet reordering would negatively impact

TCP file download time. However, the Radio Link Control (RLC) in-sequence

delivery causes a bursty IP packet arrival pattern. While an RLC PDU

is retransmitted, the RLC receiver stores all subsequent RLC PDUs.

When the RLC retransmission arrives correctly, the RLC receiver then

releases a potentially large number of IP packets to the receiving

IP layer. This burst of IP packets generates end-to-end delivery and

due to the way TCP operates, that burst of IP packets will trigger

another burst of IP packets in the reverse direction, and so on. The

size of such a burst of IP packets depends on the RLC round trip time

and the number of RLC retransmissions for the same RLC PDU. Any user

plane node in the end-to-end path needs to be prepared to handle bursty

IP packet arrival without packet loss to avoid impacting TCP file

download time. The best way to do it is to provide bandwidth capabilities.

| Synchronization | The frequency synchronization source provides a synchronization signal for the air interface better than 50 parts per billion. Suitable sources are GNSS, IEEE 1588, or NTP based network synchronization. See Section  5.1. |
| Packet loss     | The LTE system does not put requirements for packet loss ratio on the backhaul. See Section  4.                                                                                                                              |

| Bandwidth   | In the last mile, the backhaul must support peak rates of 175 Mbps equivalent to the peak rate of a 1-sector LTE 20 MHz 2x2 MIMO RBS and added headers as specified in Transport Network Dimensioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Delay       | The recommended maximum backhaul delay is in the range 15–70 ms. This is the preliminary limit at design phase that does not impose degradation of the interrupt time at handover. It refers to the one-way path from a source RBS to a target RBS via the X2. The same recommendation is valid for S1 handover. It takes longer as it includes more signalling but in this case, processing rather than transport causes delay. See Section  3.2. |

# 10 3GPP Delay Recommendations

This section provides the GBR and non-GBR delay recommendations

from 3GPP 23.203 as described in  Table 9.

To derive the Packet Delay Budget (PDB) that applies to the radio

interface, a delay of 20 ms for the delay between a PCEF and an RBS

should be subtracted from an identified PDB . This is the average

delay between the situation where the PCEF is located close to the

RBS, approximately 10 ms, and the situation where the PCEF is located

far from the RBS, for example in a roaming scenario with home-routed

traffic. The one-way packet delay between Europe and the US west coast

is approximately 50 ms. The average delay estimation takes into account

that roaming is a less typical scenario. The expectation is that by

subtracting this average delay of 20 ms from a given PDB, this leads

to a desired end-to-end performance in most typical cases. The PDB

defines an upper boundary. Actual packet delays, particularly for

Guaranteed Bitrate (GBR) traffic, should typically be lower than the

PDB specified for a QoS Class Identifier (QCI) as long as the UE has

sufficient radio channel quality.

The rate of non-congestion-related packet loss that may occur between

an RBS and a PCEF should be regarded to be negligible. A Packet Error

Loss Rate (PELR) value specified for a standardized QCI therefore

applies solely to the radio interface between the UE and the RBS.

A QCI of 1-5 or 7 is typically associated with an operator-controlled

service, that is, a service where the Service Data Flow (SDF) aggregate

UL or DL packet filters are known at the point in time when the SDF

aggregate is authorized. For E-UTRAN, this is the point in time when

a corresponding dedicated EPS bearer is established or modified.

A QCI of 6 could be used for prioritization of specific services

according to operator configuration.

A QCI of 8 could be used for a dedicated premium bearer, for example

associated with premium content for any subscriber or subscriber group.

Also in this case, the SDF aggregate UL or DL packet filters are known

at the point in time when the SDF aggregate is authorized. Alternatively,

this QCI could be used for the default bearer of UE or packet data

network for premium subscribers.

A QCI of 9 is typically used for the default bearer of a UE or

PDN for non-privileged subscribers. The aggregated Maximum Bitrate

(MBR) can be used as a tool to provide subscriber differentiation

between subscriber groups connected to the same PDN with the same

QCI on the default bearer.
