| Value Package Identity   | FAJ 801 1018   |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Introduced in            | L19.Q3         |

# 2 Benefits of Basic NR Mobility Support

The Basic NR Mobility Support value package supports mobility between LTE and NR

(standalone and non-standalone) cells and frequencies by supporting the redirection of

UEs in connected mode and idle mode. This ensures that the UE is served by the best

available network according to its capability.

# 3 Included Functions

## 3.1 NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity Overview

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature provides basic connected mode

mobility to an NR network. When the feature is active, the UE can be directed to transfer

from the LTE network to the NR network while maintaining the data session.

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4983                                                       |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature manages the redirection of

UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode to an NR network when the UE measures

good coverage in an NR frequency. Redirection is controlled by the network and

triggered by UE measurement reports of the available NR cell.

The feature provides system information about alternative NR networks that can be used by a UE

in RRC\_IDLE mode. This happens when the UE measures better

coverage in an NR cell than the current LTE cell.

If this feature is not activated, the UE stays connected to the LTE network even if an NR cell

with good coverage is available.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Network capacity is improved because the UE is served by the best available RAT.
- Service performance for an individual UE is increased by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available RAT.
- Session transition to an NR network is possible with reduced interruptions to data flows during the transition process.
- Idle mode transition to an NR network is facilitated by the transmission of SIB broadcast messages.

The subpriority configuration for NR frequencies has the following benefits:

- NR carriers with the same priority are differentiated at cell reselection.
- UEs that can understand and use subpriority have more flexibility at idle mode reselection.
- Operators get better support at introduction of NR carriers on top of the existing LTE networks, while keeping the existing priority strategies.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.2 Incoming NR IRAT Handover Overview

This feature makes it possible for a call arriving from an NR cell to be transferred to

an LTE cell without breaking the call.

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The Incoming NR IRAT Handover feature handles handovers arriving from an NR cell connected to

the 5G core network to an LTE cell connected to the EPC over the N26 interface.

Handover requests from the 5G core network to the LTE network are expected because

service coverage of the 5G network is smaller than that of the LTE network. This

feature provides reduced interruptions to data flows during session transition from

an NR cell to an LTE cell.

an NR network.

Summary

The feature extends the Release

with Redirect (RwR) function of the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

feature by enabling UE handover from the LTE network to the NR standalone network,

while maintaining the data and the voice

session. Handover is

performed through the N26 interface when the UE measures good coverage in an NR

frequency. Good NR coverage is indicated by B1 NR standalone measurements.

Handover is also performed when the UE measures poor coverage

in the current LTE frequency. If the LTE coverage is poor, B2 NR measurements are

used for mobility actions.

Compared to RwR, the outgoing NR IRAT handover procedure improves the end-user

experience in the following ways:

- Downlink packet loss is minimized by introducing support for direct packet forwarding.
- Service interruption is reduced.
