# 1 Cell Soft Lock Overview

Using the Cell Soft Lock feature, the operator can soft lock one or several

cells. This means that the traffic is moved to another cell with minimal disturbance. When

all UEs are moved, the cell is locked.

| Feature Name           | Cell Soft Lock                                                             |

| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                                           |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

To minimize the traffic impact at an RBS upgrade, it is possible to do a soft

upgrade. The soft upgrade includes a soft lock to remove the traffic before the

restart.

The benefits of this solution are the following:

- The soft lock mechanism provides a mean to minimize end-user traffic disturbances when taking a cell out of operation.
- Upgrades can be done with small or no traffic impact, which leads to a decrease of drops caused by an upgrade.
- Ongoing calls are moved to other cells (where such exist) instead of being disconnected.
- It is possible to apply soft lock without risking to interrupt ongoing emergency calls, defined as RRC Connection Request message with establishmentCause = emergency or with establishmentCause = highPriorityAccess. For a detailed description see Admission Control.

# 3 Feature Operation of Cell Soft Lock

The soft lock mechanism provides a mean to minimize end-user traffic disturbances when

taking a cell out of operation. Upgrades can be done with small or no traffic impact, which

leads to a decrease of drops caused by an upgrade.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Flowchart of Operator-triggered Cell Soft Lock

Figure 2   The Soft Lock Activities

Process Steps

1. Cell Soft Lock is triggered. See Table 3 for how the Cell Soft Lock feature can be triggered. Table 3 Triggering of Cell Soft Lock Trigger Operator or Node Description Shutting down the cell Operator The operator sets attribute EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState orEUtranCellTDD.administrativeState to value SHUTTING\_DOWN. Soft Upgrade Operator For Baseband Radio Nodes, the operator sets the upgradeType parameter to value SOFT in the UpgradePackage.activate MO action. Cell Sleep Mode Node Cell soft lock is triggered when Capacity cells enter into sleep state. MIMO Sleep Mode Node Cell soft lock is triggered before switching between MIMO and SIMO. CBRS cell Node The expiry time indicated by attributeEUtranCellTDD.cbrsTxExpireTime for a CBRS cell is reached. Note: This means that the authorization grant for the CBRS cell is expired and the traffic must be moved out of the cell within 60 seconds.
2. The node checks if the Cell Soft Lock license is installed and activated. If the license is not activated, the change request is rejected. Note: If cell soft lock is triggered by the Cell Sleep Mode or MIMO Sleep Mode features, the Cell Soft Lock license is not checked.
3. The node checks the existence of emergency call in the cell if MO attribute ENodeBFunction.checkEmergencySoftLock is set to TRUE. Note: Emergency calls are checked when cell soft lock is triggered by MIMO Sleep Mode regardless of the value of attribute ENodeBFunction.checkEmergencySoftLock. Handling of emergency calls depends on the trigger of cell soft lock. Table 4 Emergency Call Handling in Cell Soft Lock Trigger Description Shutting down the cell If there is any emergency call in the cell, the change request is rejected. Soft Upgrade For Baseband Radio Nodes, the cell soft lock procedure stops for a waiting time of up to 500 seconds if an ongoing emergency call is detected. Once the timer expires or the emergency call disconnects, the procedure continues. Cell Sleep Mode If there is any emergency call in the cell after cell soft lock conduct phase, when T1 timer is expired, T1 timer is extended with 500 seconds once. MIMO Sleep Mode CBRS cell Cell soft lock is performed regardless of any emergency call in the cell. See Admission Control for a definition of emergency call.
4. The cell starts the soft lock initialization phase to prevent new UEs to establish connection in this cell.
5. The cell enters into the soft lock conduct phase to move the UEs out of the cell.
6. When there are no more UEs in the cell or the internal timer expired, the cell is locked.

## 3.1 Cell Soft Lock Initialization Phase

In the cell soft lock initialization phase new UEs incoming to the cell are rejected.

Incoming UEs include new RRC connection requests and incoming handover requests.

Operation Seqence Diagram

Figure 3   Cell Soft Lock Phases

Process Steps

1. An internal timer, T1, is started to monitor the soft lock process. The timer is set to 90 seconds. Note: If the cell soft lock is triggered by the expiry of the authorization grant for a CBRS band, indicated by attribute EUtranCellTDD.cbrsTxExpireTime, T1 timer is adjusted to comply with the CBRS standard.
2. The cell is set to barred, the SIB1 message is updated, and pages are sent to UEs.
3. Incoming S1 or X2 handover requests from other cells are rejected. Note: If the soft locking cell receives the handover request over X2, the handover back-off time is estimated and sent to the source cell. The source cell temporarily removes the soft locking cell from the set of target cells. The handover request towards a soft locking cell can be sent after a handover back-off time. The operator can limit the maximum handover back-off time with attribute EUtranCellFDD.maxSoftLockBackoffTime or EUtranCellTDD.maxSoftLockBackoffTime.

## 3.2 Cell Soft Lock Conduct Phase

In the cell soft lock conduct phase UEs are moved out of the cell.

Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 4   Cell Soft Lock Phases

Process Steps

1. An inactivity timer is applied with 5 seconds to move UEs out of the cell faster. All UEs with voice bearers are moved out of the cell by handover with active measurement in a controlled manner. The cell performs handovers until all UEs with voice bearers are released and the timer T2 is expired. Timer T2 is configurable by ENodeBFunction.softLockRwRWaitTimerInternal or ENodeBFunction.softLockRwRWaitTimerOperator.Note: If the cell soft lock is triggered by the expiry of the authorization grant for a CBRS band, indicated by attribute EUtranCellTDD.cbrsTxExpireTime, T2 timer is adjusted to comply with the CBRS standard.
2. If the cell still has connected UEs, they are released with redirection to the highest prioritized frequency.

The total number of connected UEs at the beginning of cell soft lock initialization

phase (UECountStart) and at the end of cell soft lock

conduct phase (UECountEnd) are recorded in the service

event of availability log.

Handover Operation in Cell Soft Lock

### 3.2.1 Handover Operation in Cell Soft Lock

In the cell soft lock conduct phase, the cell first attempts to move UEs with voice

bearers out of the cell using handover with active measurement in a controlled

manner.

Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 5   Handover Operation in Cell Soft Lock

Process Steps

1. A UE with voice bearers connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB determines a set of frequencies, LTE or IRAT, where the UE can be transferred while soft locking of the cell is performed. The eNodeB finds all frequency relations, all instances of EUtranFreqRelation, UtranFreqRelation, and GeranFreqGroupRelation for the current cell according to the following criteria: At least one of the handover features (Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover, Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover, SRVCC Handover to UTRAN, SRVCC Handover to UTRAN) is active and enabled. According to the capabilities of the UE, as reported to the eNodeB in the information element UE-EUTRA-Capability, the UE is able to operate on this frequency. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, more frequencies can be supported by the UE. If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used. If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
3. If at least one of the frequencies determined in Step 2 has the attribute voicePrio set to a value different from -1, the UE can be configured to send "Soft Lock" measurement to move out from soft locking cell.
4. If the value of UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is non-zero, the node starts UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer.
5. The node starts the Soft Lock measurements when soft locking of the cell is initiated. To disable threshold1 of A5/B2 measurement configuration, threshold1 is set to the maximum value. To detect the candidate frequencies selected in Step 2, the node starts the Soft Lock measurements only for frequencies that can be measured, A5 measurement (ReportConfigA5SoftLock) for LTE frequencies and B2 measurement (ReportConfigB2Geran and ReportConfigB2Utra) for IRAT frequencies. If more frequencies can be measured than can be configured in the UE, some of the frequencies with the lowest priority are omitted according to the priority attributes voicePrio. A frequency can be measured if the following criteria are met: The UE supports measurements on the frequency. The node supports measurements on the frequency in case Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is not enabled: The node supports measurements on an LTE frequency, GERAN frequency group, or WCDMA frequency if the MOM attribute UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive is TRUE. The eNodeB supports measurements on the frequency in case Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is enabled: The node supports measurements on an LTE frequency if the MOM attribute UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF is TRUE. The node supports measurements on a GERAN frequency group if the MOM attribute UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN is TRUE. The node supports measurements on WCDMA frequency if the MOM attribute UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN is TRUE and there are configured cells for the frequency, that is, MO instances of UtranCellRelation. The priority of the frequency states can be measured. A priority value of -1 means that the frequency is not to be measured. The attribute voicePrio is used to determine the priority. Frequency relation MOs that do not have this attribute are not measured.
6. If the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer that is started in Step 4 times out and a release of the UE that has an active bearer with QCI 1 is not allowed, UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is restarted. That is, the UE remains in the cell and waits for another "Soft Lock" measurement report. This can be changed by setting parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 to TRUE. The node initiates a release with redirect to the frequency of the measurement report. This parameter only has any effect when features SRVCC Handover to GERAN and SRVCC Handover to UTRAN are not OPERABLE. Note: If the node performs a release with redirect, the default behavior in a Core Network is to remove the voice connection.
7. An A5 measurement or B2 "Soft Lock" measurement report arrives from the UE for one of the frequencies.

## 3.3 Cell Locked Phase

In the cell locked phase the cell is hard locked, and all remaining connected UEs are

released.

Attribute EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState or

EUtranCellTDD.administrativeState is finally changed to locked.

## 3.4 Process Steps for Soft Upgrade

Baseband Radio Node

1. The operator initiates soft upgrade by setting the upgradeType parameter to value SOFT in the UpgradePackage.activate MO action.
2. The RBS checks the cell soft lock license and automatically performs a hard upgrade if the license is not properly activated.
3. The RBS checks the existence of emergency calls in the cell if ENodeBFunction.checkEmergencySoftLock is set to TRUE.
4. If any ongoing emergency call is detected, the procedure stops for a waiting time of up to 500 seconds. Once the timer expires or the emergency call disconnects, the RBS continues the soft lock.

Software.

## 3.5 Cell Soft Unlock

When unlocking a cell, the Cell Soft Unlock function provides gradual ramp-up of

downlink output power. The soft ramp-up minimizes the negative impacts of sudden traffic

disturbance to surrounding cells and RBS overload by mitigating incoming handover storming

in high traffic situation.

The operator configures the following parameters manually for flexibility, based on the

cell environment:

- EutranCellFDD.dlPowerRampupInitRatio or EutranCellTDD.dlPowerRampupInitRatio for setting the initial power ratio at cell activation for each cell.
- EutranCellFDD.dlPowerRampUpRate or EutranCellTDD.dlPowerRampUpRate for setting the ramp-up power rate for each cell. The power ramp-up rate indicates the increasing rate per second to reach the targeted maximum value.

When the cell is unlocked and activated, the downlink output power starts to ramp up

gradually. The downlink output power ramps up from initial ratio to full ratio, based on

the configured parameters. The cell coverage reaches the full cell coverage gradually.

During the ramp-up time of the serving cell, coverage hole is possible where there is no

available neighbor cell.

During output power ramp-up, UEs in surrounding cells are handed over to unlocking

cells.

For tracking the ramp-up status, the Availability log records the following event

logs:

- Improved legacy log event to indicate the power ramp-up start when the cell is activated.
- New log event to indicate that the power ramp-up is done.

|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accessibility | The ability of a service to be obtained, within specified tolerances and other                   given conditions, when requested by the end user. |
| Mobility      | The ability of the system to allow movement.                                                                                                       |
| Retainability | The probability that a service, once obtained, continues to be provided under                   given conditions for a given time duration.        |

A cell that goes into SHUTTING\_DOWN mode immediately stops serving new UE requests,

therefore contributes to partial service outage to the node. As in the case of soft upgrade,

all unlocked cells perform soft lock before the regular node restart. This increases the

downtime of the node overall during the upgrade. In this case, the accessibility decreases,

but retainability increases.
