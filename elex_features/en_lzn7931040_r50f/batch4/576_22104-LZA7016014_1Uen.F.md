# 1 LTE Random Access Range Restriction Overview

The feature enables the manual configuration of random access range. With this feature,

the random access range can be configured to be smaller than the cell range.

Summary

The LTE Random Access Range Restriction feature enables the operator to define random access

range as smaller than the cell range. If the random access range is configured to be

much smaller than the cell range, the probability of accepting UEs within the cell

range but outside of the random access range is reduced. In setups with large cell

ranges, this configuration improves the accuracy of UEs accepted in the cell.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Random Access Range Restriction

The feature enables the manual configuration of random access range.

The feature allows the operator to define the random access range as smaller than the

cell range. If the random access range is configured to be much smaller than the cell

range, the probability of accepting UEs within the cell range but outside of the random

access range is reduced.

Figure 1   LTE Random Access Range Restriction Feature Operation

If the random access range is configured to be smaller than the cell range, random access

attempts within the cell range but outside of the configured random access range are

discarded. With this configuration, UEs outside of the random access range are unable to

request access to the cell, but might be able to keep their connection in case of an

ongoing call.

Random access range can be set with the EUtranCellFDD.raRange and the

EUtranCellTDD.raRange attributes.

The information provided by the following attributes and counters help the operator find

the optimal random access range configuration:

- The maximum random access observability range can be viewed with the following read-only attributes: EUtranCellFDD.raObsMaxRange EUtranCellTDD.raObsMaxRange
- The number of the discarded preambles can be observed with the following PM counters: EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc
- The distribution of the discarded random access preambles can be observed with the following PM counters: EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailMsg1DiscDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailMsg1DiscDistr
- The distribution of the measured timing offset TA values from successful random access attempts can be observed with the following PM counters: EUtranCellFDD.pmRaSuccTaDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmRaSuccTaDistr
- The distribution of the measured timing offset TA values from all detected random access attempts can be observed with the following PM counters: EUtranCellFDD.pmRaAttTaDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmRaAttTaDistr

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Random Access Range Restriction

The feature can decrease the random access success rate.

Capacity and Performance

If the random access range is configured to be smaller than the cell range, UEs in

the area within the cell range but outside of the configured random access range are

unable to request initial access to the cell. If there are many UEs this area, this

configuration causes the random access success rate to decrease.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for LTE Random Access Range Restriction

The feature introduces MO attributes to configure and observe the random access

range.

Counters

To observe the distribution of discarded random access preambles, this feature

introduces the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailMsg1DiscDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailMsg1DiscDistr

With this feature, the values of the following PM counters are calculated based on

the configured random access range:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailMsg1DiscDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailMsg1DiscDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaSuccTaDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaSuccTaDistr

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## 7.1 Enable LTE Random Access Range Restriction

The feature can be enabled with the EUtranCellFDD.raRange and the

EUtranCellTDD.raRange attributes.

Steps

1. To enable this feature, set the EUtranCellFDD.raRange or the EUtranCellTDD.raRange attribute to a value larger than 0.
