## 3.1 LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements Overview

The LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature allows for the collection of UE

measurements that can be used to detect security

attacks.

Summary

During mobile network operation various kinds of security threats can arise, such as

false base stations. This feature introduces a mechanism to collect and prepare data

for security checks without the use of additional hardware components. This leads to

improved network security.

Data is collected from the UE according to 3GPP specifications. The following

measurement types are supported:

- Inter-frequency E-UTRAN
- Intra-frequency E-UTRAN
- UTRAN
- GERAN

Security-Initiated

PM events are generated based

on

received measurements reports. These events are stored in the

eNodeB and are transferred to ENM in the following ways:

- In the Cell Trace
- In the UE Trace
- In the Cell Trace and the UE Trace

The collected data is analyzed in the ESM and compared to the legal network

topology stored in ENM to detect attacks on the network.

Regular security checks in the network efficiently prevent attacks on subscribers.

For more information and related topics, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.331, Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification
- The Ericsson Security Manager library

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.2 Port Scanning Detection and Logging Overview

Baseband Radio

Node.

Summary

The Port Scanning Detection and Logging feature adds port filtering rules to the firewall of

the Baseband

Radio Node and uses an analysis tool to detect port scanning

attacks. The port filtering rules flag incoming packets that might be part of an

attack. The analysis tool monitors and analyzes the flagged packets. If

a

suspected attack is detected, a security log entry is created. The

security log entry contains the attacker source IP address, the destination IP

address, and the ports scanned that are relevant to the attack.

The Port Scanning Detection and Logging feature offers the following benefits:

- Detection of port scanning attacks by monitoring incoming traffic towards closed ports
- Simplified investigation process by creating logs of suspected attacks

## 3.3 Theft Deterrence Overview

The Theft Deterrence feature introduces the capability to dissuade node theft by

preventing its introduction into new networks after it is locked to a particular

operator.

Summary

An operator

is

given the option to Theft Deterrence Lock the node to a list of PLMN IDs.

Subsequently, activating the node in networks with other PLMN IDs is not

possible.

The benefit of the feature is to reduce the frequency of theft of Baseband units by

making it significantly harder to use stolen Baseband units in another network.
