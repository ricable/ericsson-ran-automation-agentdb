Summary

UEs with a voice bearer can lose uplink voice packets if the uplink coverage is

insufficient. This feature detects the fast degradation of uplink conditions by

monitoring HARQ statistics. If uplink conditions are degraded, the feature performs

intra-LTE inter-frequency measurement-based handover or blind handover to move the

UE to a cell with better coverage.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Packet loss is avoided or reduced.
- VoLTE quality is improved.

Engineering Guidelines for Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

The feature introduces uplink-triggered VoLTE mobility for UEs with voice bearers if

fast degradation of uplink radio conditions occurs.

The feature is enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect attribute to one of the

following values:

- BLINDHO for blind handover
- MEASBASEDHO for measurement-based handover

Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility is only applicable for UEs with a VoLTE or a

Mission-Critical Push-To-Talk voice bearer.

## 3.1 Blind Handover

During blind handover, the coverage of the target cell is assumed, and the user

equipment is ordered to commence mobility without any measurements on target

cells.

Blind handover is chosen by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect attribute to

BLINDHO. In this case, the

EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the

EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute must be set to

true in the serving cell.

Target Cell Selection for Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Blind

Handover

When the feature is enabled, several additional attributes need to be set for the

process to be successful. The following configuration is needed for target cell

selection in the candidate frequency:

- The EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is configured for each frequency relation.Note: If multiple frequencies have the same highest priority value, all those frequencies are eligible for random selection for blind handover. For example, if the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is set to 6 for four frequencies, and all the other frequencies have lower values, all four frequencies with value 6 are eligible for random selection for blind handover.
- The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction is set to HANDOVER.

The target cell is selected from the candidate frequency set. The following

configuration is needed for the candidate cell:

- The EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed is set to true.
- The EUtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus is set to true.
- The EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator is set to COVERS.

Operational Flow

Figure 1   Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Blind Handover

1. The potential uplink packet loss threshold can be set with the EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobThr or the EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobThr attribute.
2. The eNodeB monitors the number of uplink DTX and HARQ NACK responses since the last HARQ ACK response, then compares it with the configured threshold. If the number of responses is higher than the threshold, potential uplink packet loss is detected.
3. The eNodeB determines a set of frequency candidates based on the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute values, and selects the target cell in the target frequencies. The selection is based on the configuration requirements for coverage relations specified in Target Cell Selection for Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Blind Handover. If the target cell list is empty, no target cell can be selected. The handover cannot be performed, and the procedure stops.
4. The eNodeB performs blind handover to the target cell.

## 3.2 Measurement-Based Handover

During measurement-based handover, the user equipment is ordered to measure the

signal strength or quality of the target cell, followed by an order to handover if the

measurement result meets certain criteria.

Target Cell Selection for Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Measurement-Based

Handover

When the feature is enabled, several additional attributes need to be set for the

process to be successful. The following configuration is needed for target cell

selection in the candidate frequency layer:

- The EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is configured for each frequency relation.Note: If more than one frequency layer has the same highest priority value, all those frequencies are selected as candidates for handover. For example, if the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is set to 6 for four frequencies, and all the other frequencies have lower values, all four frequencies with value 6 are chosen as candidates for handover.
- The EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction is set to HANDOVER.

The target cell is chosen from the measurement report. The target cell in the

measurement report must meet the following configuration:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is true for at least one cell of the frequency.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to true for at least one cell of the frequency.

Operational Flow

1. The potential uplink packet loss threshold can be set with the EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobThr or the EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobThr attribute.
2. The eNodeB monitors the number of uplink DTX and HARQ NACK responses since the last HARQ ACK response, then compares it with the configured threshold. If the number of responses is higher than the threshold, potential uplink packet loss is detected.
3. The eNodeB continues monitoring the link quality by checking the uplink DTX and HARQ responses. If the uplink quality recovers, or it degrades and a large number of DTX and NACK responses is detected, the handover cannot be performed and the procedure stops.
4. The eNodeB determines a set of frequency candidates based on related parameters specified in Target Cell Selection for Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Measurement-Based Handover. If the frequency set is empty, no target frequency can be selected. The handover cannot be performed and the procedure stops.
5. The eNodeB starts an A5 measurement. By setting the UeMeasControl.a5TimerUlVolteCovMob attribute, the operator can define how long the eNodeB waits for the measurement report.
6. If the eNodeB receives the A5 measurement report, it performs measurement-based handover to the target cell. If the eNodeB does not receive the A5 measurement report before the timer expires, the measurement-based handover cannot be performed. The procedure also stops if the voice bearer is released.

# 7 Activate Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature is activated.
- The Intra-LTE Handover feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012603 MO instance.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect or the EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect attribute to BLINDHO or MEASBASEDHO. If blind handover is chosen, the EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute must be set to true in the serving cell.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect or the EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobDetect attribute to DISABLED.
2. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012603 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

If the Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled, additional configuration is

recommended to avoid affecting the Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility feature.

If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is also enabled in addition to the

Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature, it is recommended to deconfigure the SCell for the

VoLTE session in a carrier aggregation scenario. In this case, UE uplink throughput

might be reduced during the VoLTE session because the SCell for uplink carrier

aggregation is not available. The SCell can be deconfigured by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute to one of the

following values:

- DECONF\_SCELLS
- DECONF\_UL\_SUPPRESS\_DL\_SCELLS
- DECONF\_UL\_SCELLS

If deconfiguring the SCell is not possible, it is recommended to set the same value for

the EUtranCellFDD.ulVolteCovMobThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulVolteCovMobThr attribute in the PCell and the

SCell that contribute to carrier aggregation. This ensures that the handover trigger is

more accurate. Triggering the handover can be affected because potential packet loss

detection is based on the HARQ response from all cells that participate in uplink

carrier aggregation.
