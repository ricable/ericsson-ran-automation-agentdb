Summary

The purpose of the Intra-LTE Handover feature is to manage the handover of the UE in

RRC\_CONNECTED mode from one LTE cell to another. This ensures

that the UE is served by the cell with the best coverage at all times. The handover

is network controlled, based on UE measurement reports of the serving and

neighbouring cells.

The intra-LTE handover process is managed by the RBS. The source and the target RBS can

communicate through an X2 link. When an X2 link is not available, the RBSs

communicate over the MME through S1 links.

The following is a simplified example of how the serving RBS manages an intra-LTE

handover. The serving RBS performs the following actions:

- Configures the UE.
- Receives measurement reports from the UE.
- Selects target cell for handover based on the measurement reports.
- Prepares the target RBS for the handover, and receives information about resources for the UE.
- Sends information received about the target cell to the UE.
- Releases resources assigned for the UE after confirmation of a successful handover.

The Intra-LTE Handover feature provides basic Connected Mode handover between neighboring

cells in an LTE network. The feature enables the UE to handover from one cell to

another with minimal disruption to data throughput.

If this feature is not activated, the UE must first detect radio link failure, then perform an

Idle Mode cell reselection to move from one cell to another. This involves the UE

moving from Connected Mode to Idle Mode to perform cell reselection with direction

from the network.

The Intra-LTE Handover feature has the following benefits:

- Maximized network capacity.
- Maximized data rates to individual UEs within the network.
- Connected Mode mobility within the network is possible with minimal interruptions to data flows during the handover process.

| Automated Neighbor Relations                                                                  | FAJ 121 0497       | LTE           | Related        |                      | The Automated Neighbor Relations feature removes the need for the manual             configuration of neighbor cell lists for intra-LTE handover. The feature automatically             constructs and maintains a list of the best neighbor cells to be used for handover based             on measurement reports from the UE. The Automated Neighbor Relations feature is             activated on a cell by cell basis.  In a radio network with a high rate of failed handovers, the ANR Detection of             Problematic Cells function can improve the handover execution success rate. In a radio             network with observable failed handovers to neighbor cells with unsupported PLMNs, the             ANR Whitelist PLMN IDs unction can improve the handover execution success rate. It             improves mobility KPIs.  If the preferred cell selection in PCI conflicts function is enabled, handover             target cell selection is improved in cell relations with PCI confusion. |

If the UE supports any of the additional frequency bands,                 the handover is initiated if all other legacy checks are fulfilled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# 3 Feature Operation of Intra-LTE Handover

The Intra-LTE Handover feature is based on the evaluations reported to the RBS by the

UE. The serving RBS uses the reports to select and prepare the target RBS, then ultimately

concludes the handover.

The feature configures A3 measurement as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331. The A3 measurement

implies that one or several neighbor cells become better than the serving cell also when some

offset and hysteresis values are taken into account, neighbor becomes offset better than

serving.

The process employed by the UE for the evaluation of surrounding

cells uses parameters sent by the serving RBS to the UE. These parameters

include hysteresis and offset values, time to trigger, and optionally

cell individual offset margins.

The UE uses RSRP and RSRQ in the cell evaluation process. RSRP represents the mean measured

power per reference signal, while RSRQ provides an indication of the reference signal

quality.

Intra-LTE handover can be set to trigger on the RSRP value or the RSRQ value. The measurement

reports sent by the UE contain one of these values, or both.

There are three types of mobility procedures for the following handovers:

- Intra-LTE handover
- Intra-RBS handover
- X2-based inter-RBS handover
- S1-based inter-RBS handover

X2 and S1 handover procedures differ mainly in the signaling towards the core network. The

handover procedures are used as follows:

- The intra-RBS handover procedure is used when both the source and target cells reside in the same RBS.
- X2 inter-RBS handover is primarily used when an X2 relation exists between source and target RBSs. Both source and target RBS must be connected to the same MME.
- S1 inter-RBS handover is primarily used when no X2 relation exists between the source and the target. The source and the target RBS can be connected to the same or to different MME. Activate the Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover feature to reduce packet loss.

Operational Process

1. The source RBS configures the UE with measurements.
2. When the RRC connection setup is completed, the UE monitors the RSRP of the serving cell. When the serving cell RSRP drops below a defined threshold, the UE begins RSRP or RSRQ measurements on the surrounding cells.
3. The UE sends an event-triggered periodic measurement report when one or several intra-frequency cells are measured to be better than the current serving cell. The measurement report is based on the parameter defined hysteresis, offset, and time to trigger.
4. When a measurement report is received by the serving RBS, it analyzes the measurement reports and determines if a handover can be initiated for the UE.
5. The RBS selects the most suitable handover candidate cell, which is referred to as the target cell. The measurement report does not trigger a handover if all reported cells are unknown. In some cases, it does not trigger a handover even if the measurement report contains known cells, but the best cell is unknown. To enable the Automated Neighbor Relations feature, CGI measurement must be reported for the best cell. The following criteria has to be fulfilled:
    - The Automated Neighbor Relations feature is operable.
    - The AnrFunctionEUtran.anrIntraFreqState attribute is set to ACTIVATED.
    - The best cell of the measurement report is unknown in the source cell, that is, there is no cell relation to the reported cell from the source cell.
    - No voice call is ongoing in the UE, the UE has no bearer with QCI1.
    - FGI bits 5 and 17 are set in the UE so the UE can perform intra-frequency CGI measurements.
    - If the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is operable and the UE is in the search zone, no earlier measurement report is ignored to enable an ANR CGI measurement. At least one measurement report is passed over to allow for a ANR CGI measurement while the UE is in the search zone.
6. The serving RBS communicates with the target RBS to prepare a handover attempt. One of the following can occur:
    - If the target RBS can accommodate the handover request, it sends information about the assigned resources to the serving RBS. The serving RBS forwards the information to the UE, then the UE attempts the handover to the target cell using the assigned resources.
    - If the target RBS cannot accept the handover attempt, it sends the handover preparation failure message to the serving RBS. When this occurs, the serving RBS waits for a new measurement report. It reevaluates the handover candidate list and prepares a handover to the next best cell. The EUtranCellFDD.minBestCellHoAttempts or EUtranCellTDD.minBestCellHoAttempts attribute can decide how many handover attempts are performed on a cell before the next best cell is chosen. If no suitable handover candidate cell exists, the connection continues on the serving cell.
7. The user plane data flow from the SGW is redirected to the target RBS once the UE has successfully connected. The original serving RBS is informed of the successful handover, and it releases the resources assigned to the UE.

## 3.1 Measurement Configuration

The serving RBS sends which frequency the UE performs measurements on. The UE in the LTE

network detects suitable neighbor cells without the assistance of a list of neighbor cells

sent by the serving RBS. The UE searches based on physical cell identity and detects suitable

handover candidates. The subsequent A3 measurement evaluation is undertaken using configured offset,

hysteresis, and time-to-trigger values.

Figure 1 shows how the UE uses parameters sent

by the RBS for evaluating handover candidate cells.

Figure 1   Parameters in Cell Evaluation Process

Measurements begin on the serving and neighboring cells when the RSRP of the serving cell

falls below the value defined in the UeMeasControl.sMeasure parameter. The

UE detects neighboring cells through intra-frequency searches.

The UE uses either RSRP or RSRQ measurements to determine whether the A3 measurement condition is

fulfilled. The ReportConfigEUtraBestCell.triggerQuantityA3 parameter is

used to configure whether RSRP or RSRQ values are used to trigger A3 measurement.

Measurements of RSRP or RSRQ are performed on the serving cells and detected neighboring

cells. The UE averages a number of measurements to filter the impact of large scale fast

fading. Different filter values can be defined for RSRP and RSRQ using

UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrp and

UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrq parameters.

The UE uses the following parameters to determine whether to trigger A3 measurement or not:

- ReportConfigEUtraBestCell.a3offset
- ReportConfigEUtraBestCell.hysteresisA3
- ReportConfigEUtraBestCell.timeToTriggerA3

The EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran parameter can be set per

cell relationship. The value is added by the UE to the measured value of the neighbor cell

before A3 measurement evaluation is done by the UE.

| Mn   |    | Measured value of the neighboring cell. Either RSRP, or RSRQ.   |
|------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|      |    |                                                                 |
| Ms   |    | Measured value of the serving cell. Either RSRP, or RSRQ.       |

Figure 2   Formula for Entering A3 Measurement

Once entering A3 measurement, the UE continues to evaluate A3 measurement for a predetermined time before

the event is fulfilled and a measurement report is sent to the serving RBS. These measurement

reports contain measurements for the serving cell and a configurable amount of detected

intra-frequency neighbor cells.

Measurement reports are sent periodically while the A3 measurement condition is fulfilled.

The UE uses the same offset and hysteresis values to determine when to leave A3 measurement when

the serving cell improves in RSRP or RSRQ relative to the neighboring cells.

| Mn   |    | Measured value of the neighboring cell. Either RSRP, or RSRQ.   |
|------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|      |    |                                                                 |
| Ms   |    | Measured value of the serving cell. Either RSRP, or RSRQ.       |

Figure 3   Formula for Leaving A3 Measurement

The measurement reports are event-triggered and re-sent periodically as long as the event is

fulfilled. The hysteresis value is used to avoid immediate re-triggering of the event.

## 3.2 Excluded Cells

Cells on the excludelist are controlled with the

EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute.

Setting the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute to

false excludes the cell in both RRC idle mode and RRC connected mode. If a

UE reports a cell on the excludelist as a candidate for handover, the node does not trigger a

handover.

If the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to

false for an existing cell relation, the corresponding cell PCI can be

included in the SIB4 or SIB5 excludelist.

Idle Mode Support

## 3.3 Barred Cell Relations

The Automatic Neighbor Relation feature can bar relations from mobility.

The ANR Detection of Problematic Cells function, with

AnrFunction.problematicCellPolicy set to

AUTO\_DETECT\_AND\_BAR, detects cell relations with low handover execution

success rate and bars them for mobility.

The ANR Whitelist PLMN IDs function bars relations to cells with non-whitelisted PLMN IDs.

The node does not trigger a handover on those relations that are barred.

For the barring procedure description, see Automated Neighbor Relations.

## 3.4 Handover, Evaluation, and Execution

The RBS starts the best cell evaluation process when a measurement report is received. The

process performs target cell selection, and handover preparation.

The best cell evaluation process maintains a list of the cell candidates

ranked by the UE in the measurement reports. The list is updated whenever

measurement reports are received by the serving cell.

When an A3 measurement report is received, the serving RBS sends a request to the

target RBS about resources to facilitate the handover. The RBSs communicate over the X2

connection if there is one. If not, handover signaling is transmitted over the S1

interface and the MME.

The target RBS performs admission control. If it can accept handover,

it reserves cell resources required for the UE. The

target RBS sends the information to the serving RBS for forwarding

to the UE.

When the target RBS cannot interpret UE-dedicated configuration in

HandoverPreparationInformation message sent by the serving RBS due

to ASN1 version mismatch, the target RBS uses the full configuration option to

reconfigure the UE.

After receiving a positive acknowledgement to the handover request, the serving RBS sends

handover directions to the UE and suspends scheduling new data transmissions to the

UE.

The UE starts the move when the source RBS sends an

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE, telling it to

perform a handover. The UE starts the timer Rrc.t304 and

ENodeBFunction.tRelocOverall to supervise the handover procedure.

The following cases can occur:

- If the Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover license is active on RLC AM data radio bearers, the serving RBS starts forwarding unacknowledged and unsent data packets to the target RBS over the X2 link.
- If the Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover license is active on RLC UM data radio bearers, only unsent data packets are forwarded to the target RBS.
- If the serving RBS is the same as the target RBS, intra-RBS handover, data forwarding is handled internally in the RBS.

After successfully accessing the target cell during the Rrc.t304

period of time, the UE sends an RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete

message.

If the source and the target RBS belong to different MMEs, and Packet Forwarding at S1

Handover license is enabled, the serving RBS forwards the unacknowledged and unsent data

packets to the target RBS. The forwarding is direct or indirect, depending on the

existence of user plane connectivity.

When the UE connects to the target RBS, the target RBS notifies the MME that the handover

occurred. The MME and SGW switch the bearer from serving RBS to target RBS, which then

becomes the serving RBS. If the SGW Relocation at X2 Handover license is active, the MME

can send new Transport Layer address and GTP TEID in the

PathSwitchRequestAcknowledge message to have the source RBS use a

new SGW. The source RBS is informed that the handover is complete.

If the source RBS does not receive any request from the MME to release resources within an

ENodeBFunction.tRelocOverall period of time, the source RBS sends

the UE Context Release Request message to the MME.

The bearer between SGW and RBS is set up for each RBS and not for

each cell. If the UE is moving to a cell in the same RBS, no switching

of the bearers occurs.

If the target RBS must reconfigure the UE, an additional

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is sent.

## 3.5 List of Neighbor Cells

When the RBS receives a valid measurement report, it checks the reported cell identities

against the list of neighbor cells. The eNodeB requests the UE to obtain a unique CGI of the

reported PCI to trigger S1 handover. The trigger occurs without creating an X2 link or cell

relation if a reported cell identity belongs to the following:

- Non-planned PCI range
- CSG cell
- Hybrid CSG cell range

If a reported cell identity is unknown, the corresponding measurement is discarded and the

unknown cell identity is reported to the Automated Neighbor Relations feature for a possible

update of the neighbor list of the cell. The Automated Neighbor Relations feature requests the

UE to obtain the unique CGI of the unknown cell so that a handover relationship and X2 link

can be established. For more information, see Automated Neighbor Relations.

## 3.6 Data Forwarding

Data forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover is possible when an X2 link is established between the

two nodes. If the handover is performed over the S1 link through the MME and SGW, data

forwarding is possible with the Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover feature, which reduces packet loss.

This can be direct, or indirect.

# 4 Network Impact of Intra-LTE Handover

The Intra-LTE Handover feature improves network capacity and Connected mode

transitions.

Capacity and Performance

The Intra-LTE Handover feature ensures that the network capacity is maximized by ensuring

that the UE is always served by the cell with the best available coverage. There are no

aspects of the intra-LTE handover process that have a detrimental affect on network

capacity.

During an LTE handover, the UE uses the LTE random access process to establish a timing

synchronization with the target RBS. Therefore, the geographic coverage range is roughly the

same at the LTE handover and at the initial cell access.

Interfaces

The Intra-LTE Handover feature improves the time taken for the UE to make Connected mode

transitions from one cell to another.

If the feature is not activated, the UE must first disconnect and return to Idle mode

before reselecting a new cell.

Activating other handover features can have the following benefits on interfaces:

- For X2 or intra-RBS handover, the associated Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature can be activated to ensure that data rates remain high following a handover.
- For X2 handover, the SGW Relocation at X2 Handover feature can be activated to support SGW relocation to utilize the network resources more efficiently.
- For S1 handover, the associated Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover feature can be activated to ensure the high data rates after a handover.

When the Automated Neighbor Relations feature is activated, handover is only allowed

between cells that have active PLMNs and are included in the PLMN whitelist. The

reason struct member in MobilityStatus struct indicates if the target

cell is whitelisted or not.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
