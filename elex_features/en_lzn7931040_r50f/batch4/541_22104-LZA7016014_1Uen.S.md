# 3 Feature Operation of Connected Users Optimization for Carrier Aggregation

The feature enables the optimization of the amount of resources allocated for carrier

aggregation-capable UEs.

This feature enables limiting the initial number of SCells configured for a UE, which

increases the Baseband resources dedicated to serve connected users. If the user data in

the buffer exceeds the aggregated scheduling capacity of the configured carriers, the

feature allows SCells upswitch to configure the maximum number of SCells. The maximum

number of SCells depends on UE and eNodeB configuration.

Resource Use

For carrier aggregation, one configured SCell consumes Baseband resources equivalent

to one connected user. Because of this, a high number of SCells configured for a

high number of UEs can have the following consequences:

- The resource use increases, which leads to a decreased capacity to serve the expected number of UEs.
- The maximum total number of connected users that can be served by the node decreases by the number of SCells configured.

The amount of resources available for the UE decreases if the following use cases and

conditions are present in the network:

- Deployments with higher levels of carrier aggregation
- Increased number of UEs supporting aggregation of more component carriers
- Transitioning towards NR with mixed mode deployments, in which the decreased Baseband resources dedicated to LTE serve the existing population of LTE UEs

Limiting the number of initially configured SCells enables the optimization of the

resources allocated for carrier aggregation-capable UEs. This increases the

availability of resources that are dedicated to serve connected users.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Feature Operation with Initially Configured SCell Limitation and SCells

Upswitch

1. Capabilities and supported carrier aggregation band and bandwidth combinations are reported by recently connected users and those handed over from other cells. Only carrier aggregation-capable UEs are considered for initially configured SCell limitation and SCells upswitch.
2. Initial SCell blind selection is handled. The number of SCells configured for the UE is limited to the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.maxNoInitSCells attribute if the following conditions are fulfilled: Total Baseband resource use &gt; Maximum RRC Connected Users × (100 − CarrierAggregationFunction.caMaxSCellsPreemptionThres) Total Baseband resource use &lt; Maximum RRC Connected Users × (100 − CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold)
3. The selected SCells and event measurements are configured.
4. The UE configured with a limited number of SCells is continuously evaluated for SCells upswitch.
5. The feature triggers SCells upswitch if the following conditions are fulfilled: The UE is entitled for SCells upswitch. The user data in the buffer exceeds the scheduling capacity of the configured carriers for a time period longer than defined by the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellsUpswitchTimer attribute.
6. If SCells upswitch is triggered, additional SCell or SCells are selected and configured from the SCell candidate list.

## 3.1 Gradual Optimization of Baseband Resource Use

The feature uses gradually restricting SCell configuration policies to optimize

Baseband resource use.

The restriction policies follow the gradually increasing amount of resource use. As the

resource use increases, a narrower restriction policy is applied using the following

limitations on SCells configuration:

1. The number of initially configured SCells is limited.
2. SCells upswitch is not allowed.
3. SCell configuration is not allowed.

Table 2   Restriction Policies and Limitations

| Restriction Policy                                          | Number of Initial SCells   | SCells Upswitch   | SCell Configuration   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Unlimited SCells policy                                     | Not limited(1)             | Allowed(2)        | Allowed               |
| Number of SCells is limited, SCells upswitch is allowed     | Limited(3)                 | Allowed(2)        | Allowed               |
| Number of SCells is limited, SCells upswitch is not allowed | Limited(3)                 | Not allowed       | Allowed               |
| SCell configuration is not allowed                          | Not applicable             | Not applicable    | Not allowed           |

(1)

The

CarrierAggregationFunction.maxNoInitSCells

attribute is configured but not used.

(2)

Only for UEs with limited number of initially configured

SCells.

(3)

The number of initial SCells is limited according to the

CarrierAggregationFunction.maxNoInitSCells

attribute.

The thresholds between restriction policies are defined as resource use margins and are

calculated based on the following values:

- CarrierAggregationFunction.caMaxSCellsPreemptionThres
- CarrierAggregationFunction.caUpswitchPreemptionThres
- CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold

## 3.2 SCells Upswitch

SCells upswitch is the selection and configuration of additional SCells for UEs with

high data throughput and limited number of initially configured SCells.

A UE is entitled for SCells upswitch if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Baseband resource use is below the threshold defined by the CarrierAggregationFunction.caUpswitchPreemptionThres attribute.
- The number of initially configured SCells is limited by the restriction policy.
- More SCell candidates are available for carrier aggregation than defined by the CarrierAggregationFunction.maxNoInitSCells attribute.
- SCells upswitch is not yet triggered for the UE.

Figure 3   SCells Upswitch Process

1. If the UE is entitled for SCells upswitch, SCells upswitch evaluation is started and upswitch pipe size is calculated for the UE. The upswitch pipe size calculation is based on the aggregated scheduling capacity of the PCell and all configured SCells, that is scaled by the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellsUpswitchDataThres attribute.
2. The upswitch pipe size is continuously compared to the size of the UE data buffer.
3. If the user data in the buffer exceeds the upswitch pipe size for a time period longer than defined by the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellsUpswitchTimer attribute, an SCells upswitch is triggered and the SCells upswitch evaluation is stopped.
4. If an SCells upswitch is triggered, the maximum number of SCells is selected from the candidate list and configured for the UE. The maximum number of SCells depends on UE and eNodeB configuration.

## 9.1 Configure Connected Users Optimization for Carrier Aggregation

This feature can be configured to optimize resource use.

Steps

1. Set the following attributes: CarrierAggregationFunction.maxNoInitSCells to define the number of initially configured SCells CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold to define the restriction policy threshold related to SCell configuration CarrierAggregationFunction.caUpswitchPreemptionThres to define the restriction policy threshold related to SCells upswitch Note: If this feature is configured for the first time, this attribute need to be set to a value different from default. The value of this attribute must be greater than or equal to the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold attribute. CarrierAggregationFunction.caMaxSCellsPreemptionThres to define the restriction policy threshold related to initially configured SCell limitation Note: If this feature is configured for the first time, this attribute need to be set to a value different from default. The value of this attribute must be greater than or equal to the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.caUpswitchPreemptionThres attribute. CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellsUpswitchDataThres to define the data-related condition for SCells upswitch CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellsUpswitchTimer to define the time-related condition for SCells upswitch For recommended configurations, see RAN Parameter Recommendations.
