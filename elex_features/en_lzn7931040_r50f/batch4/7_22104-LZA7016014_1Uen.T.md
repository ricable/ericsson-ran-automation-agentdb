# 1 LTE Extended N77 Band Support Overview

This feature enables the use of the extended n77 band frequency ranges only for UEs with

the n77 capability extension.

Summary

With this feature, only UEs with the n77 capability extension can access the 3,450-3,550 MHz

or the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band. UEs can only access

the frequency range that is indicated by their extended n77 band IRAT parameter.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following network

elements:

- It is required to use ENM version 23.2 or later to support this feature.
- The UE must support the n77 extension capability.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Extended N77 Band Support

The feature operates by prompting a UE capability validation and restricting access

to the extended n77 band frequency ranges only to UEs that support the capability

extension.

To determine if the UE supports the extended n77 band, the

UECapabilityInformation RRC message is checked for the appropriate

IRAT parameter.

The UE capability validation is performed in the following processes:

- NR frequency selection for B1 measurement configuration: EN-DC setup EN-DC-triggered handover NR coverage-triggered session continuity IRAT handover to NR standalone
- Cell reselection priority for E-UTRAN and NR

NR Frequency Selection for B1 Measurement Configuration

The eNodeB configures UEs with extended n77 band frequency ranges for B1 measurement

configuration only if the UE capability message indicates the appropriate IRAT

parameter.

To avoid monitoring unnecessary NR frequencies for the UE, the extended n77 band

frequency ranges are removed if the following requirements are fulfilled:

- In case of the 3,450-3,550 MHz frequency range: The ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77Supported attribute is set to true. The UE capability does not indicate the extendedBand-n77-r16 IRAT parameter for the n77 capability extension.
- In case of the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range: The ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute is set to true. The UE capability does not indicate the extendedBand-n77-2-r17 IRAT parameter for the n77 capability extension.

Idle Mode Mobility Control

If the UE indicates support for the n77 capability extension with the appropriate

IRAT parameter, the extended n77 band frequency ranges can be included in the

IMMCI IE of the

RRCConnectionRelease message.

true, indicates if the feature is deployed on the eNodeB.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Extended N77 Band Support

This feature improves UE throughput for UEs that support the feature by enabling the

exclusive use of the extended n77 band frequency ranges.

Capacity and Performance

EN-DC setup can increase because an additional cell operating at the extended n77

band can be included.

If the extended n77 band is deployed in a network without feature activation or if it

is not supported by all nodes, the following KPIs can decrease:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in eNodeB

Interfaces

This feature affects the Uu interface by checking the

UECapabilityInformation message for the appropriate IRAT

parameter to identify if the UE supports the feature.

Counters

The following counters can increase in the eNodeB if there is a significant number of

UEs with the  n77 extension capability:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc

If extended n77 band frequency ranges are deployed in a network without feature

activation or if it is not supported on all nodes, the following impacts apply:

- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in eNodeB is degraded.
- The EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupFailUeCap or the EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupFailUeCap PM counters increase respectively.
- UE throughput can decrease due to unnecessary measurement gap configuration.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the use of EN-DC for UEs with cells operating at the

3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band.

Capacity and Performance

UE throughput increases if cells operating at the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of

the extended n77 band are configured to the UE.

This feature enhancement can increase the value of the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc

If the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band is deployed in a

network without feature activation, or the feature is not enabled for all nodes, the

following KPIs can degrade:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate
- NR Handover Success Rate

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported
- GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported

The following attributes must be configured to enable this feature enhancement in

EN-DC deployment:

- The GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute must be set to true.
- The NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute value must be set to 57.
- The ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute must be set to true.

If the NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute value is set to

57, the following requirements must be fulfilled:

- The NRCellDU.bandListManual attribute must contain 77 only.
- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL attribute must be in the range of 643334-665333.

Interfaces

This change affects the Uu interface by updating the

UECapabilityInformation message with the

extendedBand-n77-2-r17 IE to identify if the UE supports the

3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.
