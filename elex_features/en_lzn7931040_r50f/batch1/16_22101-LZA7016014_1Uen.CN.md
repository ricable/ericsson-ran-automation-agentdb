| Introduced In            | L17.Q4         |

# 2 Benefits of Carrier Aggregation

Carrier Aggregation increases user bandwidth by combining carriers on the same or

different frequency bands.

Carrier Aggregation increases user bandwidth across the network by combining carriers.

Carriers on the same or different frequency bands can be combined, which allows

operators with a fragmented, non-contiguous frequency spectrum to provide competitive

service.

The features included in the Carrier Aggregation value package provide the following

benefits:

- Better user experience
- Higher peak throughput
- Improved application coverage
- Improved spectrum efficiency
- Increased network capacity

# 3 Included Functions

The 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature can transmit data to a single UE on

three carriers simultaneously. This leads to increased downlink speed and improved end-user

experience.

Summary

The 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature supports the capability to transmit

data to a single UE on three carriers simultaneously.

In addition, a band combination signaling is introduced according to 3GPP TS

36.331. The introduced band combination signaling enables UEs supporting

more than 128 band combinations to provide all relevant band combinations to the

eNodeB. The UE only reports carrier aggregation band combinations for specific bands

requested by the eNodeB. This replaces the reporting of all the supported carrier

aggregation band combinations.

By supporting a higher number of MIMO layers, a higher spectrum efficiency with

higher peak downlink throughput can be achieved.

The maximum number of MIMO layers that can be configured for the UE depends on the

following characteristics:

- Corresponding capacity and peak rate limitations of the eNodeB Baseband platform
- Corresponding capacity and peak rate limitations of the UE capabilities

The feature has the following benefits:

- The downlink speed is increased across the coverage area.
- A more efficient use of scattered spectrum makes it possible to combine up to three components of the LTE spectrum.
- The end-user experience is improved through achieving peak throughput based on the system configurations, the number of component carriers, and the number of TX layers in unit of Mbps at the physical layer.
- In a TDD deployment, HARQ-ACK feedback information is clearer, leading to lower BLER, and higher and more stable downlink throughput.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature provides the capability to transmit data to a UE capable of 3GPP Release

13 or later on six LTE carriers simultaneously, up to a total bandwidth of 120 MHz.

For 6CC carrier aggregation, the PCell must be an FDD cell. Compared to fewer

component carriers, the 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature has the

following benefits:

- More efficient use of the scattered LTE spectrum (FDD, TDD, LAA, and CBRS)
- Higher average and peak downlink UE throughput, subject to UE category limitations

The feature uses reduced band combination signaling for enhanced carrier aggregation

according to 3GPP TS 36.331 and 3GPP TS 36.101. This

enables the UE to inform the eNodeB about relevant band combinations in a smaller

RRC capability information message. This reduces the RRC signaling load.

6CC downlink carrier aggregation is supported in Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation deployments.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD feature allows for downlink traffic to be offloaded

on the TDD spectrum without being constrained by the limited uplink application

coverage of a TDD carrier. Instead, a UE can be served by the larger uplink range of

the FDD carrier while still benefiting from the substantial downlink performance

boost provided by the TDD carrier.

Figure 1 shows an over-the-air drive

measurement and illustrates the coverage extension of the TDD spectrum when combined

with FDD in carrier aggregation.

Figure 1   Extending TDD Coverage

In sites where both FDD and TDD spectrum are available, the Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD

feature supports the use of both spectrum resources. This improves system

performance and end-user experience.

For more information about the benefits of carrier aggregation, see Carrier Aggregation.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- The TDD downlink coverage is extended and the user data rate gain is improved by using the uplink of FDD carriers. As uplink HARQ feedback is sent on FDD carriers, TDD HARQ bundling is not required.
- The user peak throughput is increased by combining FDD and TDD data rates.
- Asymmetric traffic is supported.

The Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD feature supports the following characteristics:

- The feature supports any mix of FDD, TDD, and LAA SCells with an FDD PCell, depending on the activated Carrier Aggregation feature licenses.
- The following transmission modes are supported: TDD cells configured with TM7 and TM8 are overridden to TM3 when used as SCells or ESCells. TDD cells can be configured with TM9 when used as SCells in intra-eNodeB carrier aggregation or as ESCells in Elastic RAN FDD-TDD carrier aggregation.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The Carrier Aggregation feature has the following benefits:

- Increased downlink speed across the coverage area
- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum
- Higher capacity

The Carrier Aggregation feature supports the following characteristics:

- Up to two downlink component carriers
- Statically configured secondary component carrier
- Mixed transmission mode supported between carriers
- Same downlink and uplink subframe configuration for aggregated TDD carriers
- Dynamic activation or deactivation of the secondary component carrier
- No cross-carrier scheduling
- Inter-band aggregation
- Contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation between TDD carriers and between FDD carriers
- Non-contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation for FDD and TDD carriers
- Intra- and inter-LTE mobility

A UE configured for carrier aggregation has one PCell and one SCell. The PCell is the cell

where the UE is connected, has established the RRC connection, and is operating on the

primary frequency. The SCell operates on a secondary frequency and can be configured once

the RRC connection is established.

If the Cell Sleep Mode feature is active, it can affect the Carrier Aggregation feature.

If, for example, all SCell candidates are capacity cells that have sleep mode enabled, the

carrier aggregation capability is disabled when all capacity cells enter sleep mode. Also,

if the PCell is a capacity cell with sleep mode enabled, the carrier aggregation capability

of a UE ends as the UE moves out of the cell when the cell enters sleep mode.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

Summary

IDC is the ability to host multiple radio transceivers in the same UE in a way that

prevents interference between those transceivers. When the UE informs the eNodeB

that it experiences radio interference, the eNodeB prevents carrier aggregation from

using SCells on problematic frequencies.

UEs use the following RRC IEs:

- The inDeviceCoexInd-UL-CA-r11 IE is used to declare the UE capability of reporting IDC indications addressing the interference for uplink carrier aggregation.
- The VictimSystemType-r11 and the AffectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 IEs are used to report the detected interference problems.

The eNodeB remedies the interference problem by disabling inter-band and

intra-band uplink grants for the reported problematic frequencies.

This feature has the following benefits:

- UEs experience reduced uplink radio interference from SCells during uplink carrier aggregation.
- UE malfunction caused by radio interference is prevented between transceivers in live networks. This can happen when the UE uses carrier aggregation to carry uplink data.
- Multiple uplink carrier aggregation transmissions do not cause interference in other UE components like GNSS. The Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature can remain activated.

Summary

The Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation feature is based

on the Carrier Aggregation feature and supports the following functions:

- A cell used as a PCell can have more than one SCell candidates.
- An SCell candidate can be added or deleted without the need to lock and unlock the cell for the change to take effect.
- Based on L3 measurements and through the SCell selection algorithm, the SCell of a UE is dynamically configured or deconfigured.
- When the number of component carriers is decided, it is not considered whether the UE can support a lower subset of band combinations. Therefore, there is more opportunity for a configuration with a higher number of component carriers.
- The SCell selection is bandwidth- and layer-aware using effective bandwidth evaluation.
- After successful SCell configuration, any SCell deconfiguration attempt is prevented if it leads to an unsupported UE capability or non-standard carrier aggregation band combination.

Summary

The suitable LAA carrier frequency is the one least occupied with interfering

traffic.

The Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) function allows for the eNodeB to select the

suitable LAA carrier frequencies automatically from the allowed frequencies in the

unlicensed spectrum. An LBT algorithm ensures that the carrier is free before

transmission.

LAA SCells are downlink-only and up to three LAA SCells can be configured.

The feature has the following benefits:

- The licensed spectrum is available for other purposes in areas with LAA deployment.
- A large amount of bandwidth available in the unlicensed 5 GHz band can be used for mobile broadband to increase downlink data throughput.

Summary

A UE is using one cell as PCell and one or more other cells as SCells. The PCell has

both a downlink and an uplink component carrier. The SCells can have either downlink

and uplink, or only downlink component carriers, but not only uplink. A cell can be

PCell for some UEs and SCell for other UEs. The feature supports the transmission of

uplink data over both the PCell and the SCell when a UE has an activated SCell.

This feature has the following benefits:

- UE data transmission simultaneously on more than one carrier
- Up to doubled uplink UE throughput
- Increased average uplink UE throughput
- Increased application coverage for uplink-demanding services
