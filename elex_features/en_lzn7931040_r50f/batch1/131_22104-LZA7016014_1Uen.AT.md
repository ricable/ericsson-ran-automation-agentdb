## 3.1 Controlling the PDSCH Type B Power

The feature enables setting the power of PDSCH type B resource elements relative to

the power of PDSCH type A resource elements.

The pdschTypeBGain parameter is used to set the power of PDSCH type B

resource elements. The level of PDSCH type B resource elements can be set according to

the gain. The gain is relative to resource elements of PDSCH type A. If the gain is 50%,

the power of a PDSCH type B resource element is 50% of the power of a PDSCH type A

resource element.

The gain of PDSCH type B is used for the following purposes:

- Improving the use of the downlink radio power in case of low or negative CRS boostNote: Low or negative CRS boost is indicated by the following values: -3 dB -2 dB -1 dB 0 dB
- Preventing over-allocation of the downlink radio power in case of high CRS boostNote: High CRS boost is indicated by the following values: 1.77 dB 3 dB 4.77 dB 6 dB
- Reducing cell interference

Using this feature, the network can be configured for maximum signal energy. With this

configuration, it is possible to decrease the PDSCH type B power by decreasing the gain

relative to PDSCH type A.

For more information on controlling the PDSCH type B power, see 3GPP TS 36.331,

Radio Resource Control (RRC).

# 4 Network Impact of Adjustable CRS Power

The feature affects the capacity and performance of the network.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enables the following functions:

- Boosting of CRS power by using the following parameters: EUtranCellFDD.crsGain EUtranCellTDD.crsGain EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain If the radio has insufficient power headroom, boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB causes power loss on common channels and on PDSCH channels. No impact or less impact can be observed on common channels and on PDSCH channels if the radio has sufficient power headroom.
- Decreasing of reference signal boost to negative values or a power level below the PDSCH type A power.Note: The effect of decreasing the reference signal boost to negative values or a power level below the PDSCH type A power is unknown.
- Decreasing of PDSCH type B power by decreasing the gain relatively PDSCH type A.

Using this feature, the network can be configured for maximum signal energy.

Adjustable CRS Power without Msg2 power boost leads to a decrease in random access

scheduling requests.

Interfaces

The feature introduces attributes to the EAB CELL INFO FETCH RESPONSE

X2AP message to support CRS power boost higher than 3 dB with inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation and elastic RAN.

# 6 Performance of Adjustable CRS Power

Boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB can degrade related KPIs and PIs if the radio

has insufficient power headroom.

KPIs

If the radio has insufficient power headroom, boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB

causes power loss on common channels and on PDSCH channels. This might degrade the

following KPIs and PIs:

- Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput
- DL HARQ BLER
- DL HARQ Response Rate
- DL HARQ Success Rate
- PDCCH Packet Error Rate
- PDCCH Usage
- Retainability EPS Bearers
- UL HARQ Response Rate

No impact or less impact can be observed in these KPIs and PIs if the radio has

sufficient power headroom when boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Adjustable CRS Power

## 8.1 Configure Adjustable CRS Power

PDSCH type A resource elements are located within a symbol that does not contain reference

signals in the air interface. According to 3GPP TS 36.213, the

crsGain attribute corresponds to

-ρA.

PDSCH type B resource elements are located within a symbol that contains reference signals

in the air interface. According to 3GPP TS 36.213, the

pdschTypeBGain attribute corresponds to

PB or ρB

/ρA.

The value of the EUtranCellFDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute or the

EUtranCellTDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute affects CRS power

boosting when the crsGain attribute is set to 4.77 dB or 6 dB. For more

information, see Table 3.

Table 3   Impact of the adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled Attribute

| Value of the adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled Attribute   | Impact                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| false                                             | If the value of the crsGain attribute is 4.77 dB or 6 dB, it                   is mapped to 3 dB to avoid overallocation of RF signal power. |
| true                                              | Support for boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB is enabled.                                                                                |

To prevent overallocation of RF signal power, the pdschTypeBGain

attribute is remapped to a gain equal to 1 if the following conditions are

fulfilled:

- The crsGain attribute is set to 1.77 dB or 3 dB.
- The adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute is set to false.
- PDSCH Type B gain is 5/4 (pdschTypeBGain is 0).

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.213.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.crsGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.crsGain attribute to adjust CRS power. This configuration sets the downlink power of the cell-specific reference signals relative to a reference level defined by the power of the PDSCH type A resource elements. If crsGain is +3 dB, the power of the reference signal is 3 dB higher than a PDSCH type A resource element.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute to adjust the power of PDSCH Type B. This configuration specifies the power level of PDSCH type B resource elements according to a power gain which is set relatively to resource elements of PDSCH type A.

After This Task

Absolute mobility thresholds might need to be adjusted if reference signal power is

changed.

Power Control

## 8.2 Configure CRS Power Boost of 4.77 dB and 6 dB

Boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB can be achieved with negligible or no impact on

common channels and PDSCH channels if the radio has sufficient power headroom.

The power headroom of the radio is defined as the difference between the following

characteristics:

- The value of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute
- The radio hardware or license capability

If the radio has insufficient power headroom, boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or

6 dB causes power loss on common channels and on PDSCH channels.

If the radio has enough power headroom, it is recommended to reconfigure the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. This is to

ensure that boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB and 6 dB is achieved with negligible or no

impact on common channels and PDSCH channels.

Reconfiguring the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower is not needed

when the radio has insufficient power headroom.

Prerequisites

The cell is not part of an ESS cell pair.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.crsGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.crsGain attribute to the value 477 or 600.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute to adjust the power of the PDSCH Type B resource element. The recommended value for the EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute is 1. It is not recommended to set these attributes to 0 (PDSCH Type B gain is 5/4).
4. Set the EUtranCellFDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute to true.

If reconfiguration of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

attribute is needed:

5. Reconfigure the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute according to the following formula: SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower = current\_SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower × factor. For more information on the value of the factor, see Table 4. Table 4 Factor for SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower Reconfiguration Value of crsGain Value of pdschTypeBGain (PDSCH Type Gain) Factor 477 0 (5/4) 1.33 477 1 (4/4) 2 (3/4) 3 (1/2) 1.17 600 0 (5/4) 1.50 600 1 (4/4) 2 (3/4) 3 (1/2) 1.33
6. Unlock the cell.

following KPIs and PIs:

- Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput
- DL HARQ BLER
- DL HARQ Response Rate
- DL HARQ Success Rate
- PDCCH Packet Error Rate
- PDCCH Usage
- Retainability EPS Bearers
- UL HARQ Response Rate

No impact or less impact can be observed in these KPIs and PIs if the radio has

sufficient power headroom. Such impact can be achieved by configuring the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute according to the

setting of the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.crsGain or EUtranCellTDD.crsGain

- EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain or EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain

Operation

To boost CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB, the following requirements must be

fulfilled:

- The number of configured cell-specified antenna ports is two or four. Note: The feature enhancement is not supported when the number of antenna ports is one.
- The cell is not part of an ESS cell pair.
- The EUtranCellFDD.crsGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.crsGain attribute is set to 4.77 dB or 6 dB.
- The introduced EUtranCellFDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute or the introduced EUtranCellTDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute is set to true.

This feature enhancement is not recommended for NB-IoT in-band deployment use cases,

where the LTE host cell bandwidth is 3 MHz or 5 MHz.

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled
- EUtranCellFDD.pa
- EUtranCellTDD.pa
- EUtranCellFDD.pb
- EUtranCellTDD.pb

Hardware

This feature enhancement is not supported in the following use cases:

- AAS-capable radios
- RDS IRUs

Interfaces

This change affects the X2 interface by introducing parameters to the EAB CELL

INFO FETCH RESPONSE X2AP message to support use cases of inter-eNodeB

carrier aggregation and elastic RAN.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
