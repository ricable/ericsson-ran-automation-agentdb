IMS voice service over LTE enables operator to provide add-on IMS services for

premium, high ARPU users.

Revenue Growth: Reduce churn

VoLTE increases customer satisfaction through high call

quality

and by

allowing simultaneous use of voice and high speed data

services.

# 4 Included Functions

## 4.1 Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation Overview

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature provides improved average

uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services without reducing VoIP capacity.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1789                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature provides improved average

uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services in a mixed scenario with both VoIP

and MBB services. The feature improves throughput specifically when a large number

of VoIP users are active in the cell. This benefit does not reduce the VoIP

capacity. It is also possible to increase the VoIP capacity instead of improving the

average uplink and downlink throughput for MBB services.

By applying an age-dependent weight to VoIP packets, scheduling resources are only

used for VoIP services when this is required to avoid exceeding the PDB. This

results in scheduling several VoIP packets during a scheduling instance, and

efficient use of the RBS resources.

The Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation feature also decreases the delay of

VoIP packets from the UE that require Radio Link Control (RLC) segmentation. The

segments are scheduled in consecutive TTIs.

For UEs that are configured with DRX, and support 3GPP release 9 and onwards,

Scheduling Request (SR) Suppression is enabled while the UE is in VoIP TALK state.

This is to reduce power consumption in the UE.

## 4.2 Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support Overview

Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support introduces the functionality to support

handling of emergency calls in an LTE network for UEs in limited service mode.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1743                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

The feature enables the UE user to setup and maintain emergency calls even when UE is

out of home network coverage or there is no SIM card inserted.

This comprises:

- Broadcast in SIB1 of an ims-EmergencySupport indicator of the core network support of emergency calls for UEs in limited service mode, for example UEs without a SIM card. With this indication UEs are allowed to set up emergency calls in limited service mode.
- Support of EIA0 (null) integrity protection algorithm and EEA0 (null) ciphering protection algorithm expected to be (implicitly) signaled by the MME for UEs in limited service mode. Note: EIA0 (null) integrity protection algorithm and EEA0 (null) ciphering protection algorithm is supported regardless of the configuration of the following parameters: SecurityHandling.cipheringAlgoPrio SecurityHandling.integrityProtectAlgoPrio
- Support of mobility of emergency calls for UEs in limited service mode.

## 4.3 RLC in Unacknowledged Mode Overview

The RLC in Unacknowledged Mode feature provides reduced control signaling

overhead.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0861                                                                                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                                                                                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                                                                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                                                                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license                                 for                                 each node. |

Summary

The RLC in Unacknowledged Mode feature is useful for services that tolerate a packet

loss rate and require lower latency. One

of the most

important

of

these delay-sensitive streaming

services

is VoIP (VoLTE or

PTT).

## 4.4 Robust Header Compression Overview

| Access Type:            | LTE                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0892                              |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                       |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. Once license per radio. |

Summary

The Robust Header Compression feature is a framework specified by the IETF to compress IP

packet headers. The feature is used in LTE to compress headers of primarily radio

bearers carrying VoIP calls (VoLTE or PTT) to increase capacity and coverage. Before

the Robust Header Compression feature is used, a channel between the two ROHC

end-points must be established.

The RoHC entity has a flow classifier responsible for associating IP packets with a

context (and a compression algorithm) so that flows can be multiplexed on the same

bearer.

The following RoHC profiles are supported:

- 0x0000 No compression (RFC 4995)
- 0x0001 RTP/UDP/IP (RFC 3095, RFC 4815)
- 0x0002 UDP/IP (RFC 3095, RFC 4815)

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Decreases the size of a VoIP packet and thereby decreases the capacity needed for a VoIP call. This improves the over-the-air capacity for best effort users which share bandwidth with VoIP users in the cell.
- Increases the cell coverage when segmentation occurs during H-ARQ retransmissions.

## 4.5 Robust SRVCC Handover at Call Setup Overview

The feature introduces the possibility to delay the SRVCC handover to ensure a VoLTE

call can be successfully set up before transferring it to GSM or WCDMA.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4855                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

In the LTE radio coverage, the data coverage area is larger than the voice coverage

area. VoLTE calls in weak coverage on cell edges can trigger the SRVCC handover to

GSM or WCDMA immediately at setup.

When the SRVCC handover at call setup in pre-alerting phase is not supported, the

feature provides the eNodeB with robust SRVCC handover at call setup. This means the

eNodeB delays the IRAT handover to GSM or WCDMA in the pre-alerting phase and

triggers it only after the SIP 180 (Ringing) response. The delay ensures that VoLTE

calls can successfully be set up and transferred to GSM or WCDMA.

Activating the feature is not needed

in a network where an Ericsson MSC is used with the Robust SRVCC feature activated.

## 4.6 Service Specific DRX Overview

The Service

Specific DRX feature enables configuring different DRX parameter settings for different

services. This optimizes the DRX configuration for the respective

service.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Summary

By

enabling different DRX parameter settings for different services,

the

Service Specific DRX feature enables

optimized

configurations on a service

level.

This way, UE battery can be saved with

less

negative impact on the system performance. This feature introduces QoS Class

Identifier (QCI) dependent DRX settings which are defined by the operator.

The feature has the following benefits:

- DRX configuration is chosen based on the primary service of the current UE configured by the operator.
- This feature provides both UE battery savings and reduced negative DRX impact on system performance. Using the eMBMS VoLTE DRX (drxProfile=18) provides further battery savings by allowing service specific DRX for VoLTE in coexistence with eMBMS.
- By disabling DRX at voice call setup, the feature improves call setup time.
- It is possible to disable DRX in poor coverage conditions for VoIP service without TTI Bundling enabled. Disabling DRX in poor coverage conditions is also possible for non-VoIP services.

## 4.7 Service Specific Inactivity Timer Overview

The Service Specific Inactivity Timer feature enables the extension of the UE

inactivity timer for each QCI. The UE is kept in connected mode longer to give VoLTE or PTT

voice more time to answer a call before it is dropped due to inactivity.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4246                                             |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

When a VoLTE or PTT call is made, the alert phase is often longer than it is for a

regular call. If the UE inactivity timer times out during this alert phase, the UE

becomes idle and the call is dropped. To avoid dropping the call, the Service

Specific Inactivity Timer feature enables the extension of the expiration time for

the existing UE inactivity timer.

Different time values can be configured for different QCIs to mach their respective

needs.

With this feature activated, it is possible to prevent dropping a call even if the UE

takes too much time to answer.

## 4.8 LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone Overview

This feature keeps an NR SA-capable UE in the LTE network for a configurable time period

after the UE performs an emergency

service.

| Access Type             | LTE                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5375                                             |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

This feature prevents an NR SA-capable UE from returning to the NR network after the UE

initiates an emergency call or emergency session. The feature keeps the UE in the

LTE network for a configurable time period after the emergency service begins. This

ensures that the PSAP can call back UEs faster after the emergency service.

The feature introduces an IE to support this function in the following cases:

- LTE handover
- RRC Re-establishment

The UE remains in the LTE network on the following conditions:

- The QoS of a QCI5 bearer changes to an ARP value for emergency
- QCI1 bearer release with an ARP level value for emergency
- QCI5 bearer establishment with an ARP level value for emergency
- Any UE payload activity over a QCI5 bearer with an ARP level value for emergency
