# 3 Feature Operation of TTI Bundling

In case of insufficient power during VoIP

transmissions, the UE uses TTI Bundling to transmit data.

TTI Bundling Operational Process

Figure 1   TTI Bundling Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The scheduler determines if the UE is using a VoIP service and benefits from TTI Bundling or not.
2. If the UE is using a VoIP service and benefits from TTI Bundling, then it is configured by RRC signaling to use TTI Bundling.
3. The UE transmits the data that is allowed to transmit, according to the grant in four consecutive TTIs. Note: TTI Bundling requires one single grant for PUSCH transmissions in four consecutive TTIs. The data transmitted in the four TTIs is identical, but different redundancy versions are used.
4. When the node receives the last TTI, one HARQ feedback message per bundle is sent.
5. The data is retransmitted within 16 ms.

The overhead resulting from RLC and MAC headers and CRC is less when TTI Bundling is

used compared to the case where RLC segmentation is used. The TTI Bundling feature

is only used for UEs that are using a VoIP service.

RLC Segmentation

The eNB specifies the UL transmissions to the UE by transmitting a grant on the PDCCH

channel. To be able to decode the UL transmission, the UE must transmit with

sufficient power. If the UE is power limited, the UE is not able to transmit a

single VoIP packet during one TTI.

If the UE is not able to accumulate sufficient power to transmit a small amount of

data, like a VoIP packet, the RLC SDU can be segmented into RLC PDUs. Each segment

is transmitted with a separate HARQ process.

Figure 2 shows an example with

an RLC SDU that cannot be transmitted with a transmission during one TTI. Instead

the RLC SDUs are segmented into RLC PDUs and each PDU is transmitted separately. In

this example, the RLC SDU is segmented four times.

Figure 2   RLC Segmentation

RLC segmentation has the following drawbacks:

- The relative amount of control information that needs to be transmitted increases with the number of segments.
- The control signaling load increases with the number of segments, since every segment requires PDCCH and PHICH transmission.
- The probability for HARQ feedback errors increases with the number of segments. Assuming RLC UM, a VoIP packet is lost when a NACK is interpreted as an ACK.

Conditions of TTI Bundling

TTI Bundling is not beneficial when the UE is in good radio conditions. The UE in

good radio conditions can transmit several VoIP packets in one TTI and use a HARQ

retransmission time of 8 ms when it is configured for normal HARQ operation.

Transmission of several VoIP packets in one TTI allows for efficient scheduling. A

short HARQ retransmission time is beneficial for delay-sensitive services like

VoIP.

1. The eNB determines which UEs benefit from TTI Bundling by measuring the UL channel quality (filtered SINR) per UE. The following options are available during UL channel quality determination:
    1. If the UL channel quality of a UE is worse than EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThres = 90, it is configured for TTI Bundling.
    2. If the UL channel quality of a UE is better than EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThres = 90, it is configured for normal HARQ operation.

Figure 3 shows how the measured

SINR for a UE is filtered and compared to

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThres. In this example, the UL

channel quality of the UE is getting worse and when it becomes worse than

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThres and

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThresHyst the UE is configured

for TTI Bundling.

Figure 3   Measurements of the UL Channel Quality

The measurement SINR data points shown in Figure 3 are as a function of time.

The measurement points are filtered and the filtered SINR is used to determine the

UL channel quality of the UE. The

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThres and

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingSwitchThresHyst attributes are used

to determine if a UE has to be configured for TTI Bundling (when the UL channel

quality is bad) or for normal HARQ operation (when the UL channel quality is

good).

When a UE in TTI bundling mode performs a handover or re-establishment, the UE loses

its connection to the network under the following conditions:

- The target cell has poor channel quality.
- The UE is not configured with TTI bundling upon handover or re-establishment.

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingAfterHo and

EUtranCellFDD.ttiBundlingAfterReest attributes are used to

enable TTI bundling configuration during handover or re-establishment.

# 4 Network Impact of TTI Bundling

The feature increases

the performance of VoLTE enhancement and reduces UL output.

Capacity and Performance

In accordance with the 3GPP specifications, TTI Bundling provides reduced UL

throughput on the air interface. UL transmissions with TTI Bundling are limited to

QPSK modulation and the resource assignment is maximum 3 PRBs.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| VoIP Integrity | This KPI measures the integrity impact for VoIP in the RAN. An                                     E-RAB is defined as VoIP based on settings of the                                         QciProfilePredefined.ServiceType and                                         QciProfileOperatorDefined.ServiceType                                     attributes.  Because TTI Bundling provides better UL coverage compared to RLC                                     segmentation, an increase in the KPI metrics is expected. |
