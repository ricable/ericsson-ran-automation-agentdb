# 1 Inter-Frequency Offload Overview

The feature is part of load management. It is used to offload traffic to the E-UTRAN

network if the traffic load in the E-UTRAN cells exceeds a configured level.

Summary

The Inter-Frequency Offload feature is part of the Load Management features. Load balancing

relations are configured between two E-UTRAN cells. The Inter-Frequency Offload

feature is used to offload traffic to the E-UTRAN network (Ericsson or non-Ericsson

E-UTRAN FDD or TDD cells) if the traffic load in the E-UTRAN cells exceeds a

configured level.

The feature uses the function introduced by the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature for the

assessment of traffic load based on the presence of E-RABs in the cell and the QoS

class to which they belong.

This feature is an alternative feature of Inter-Frequency Load Balancing. The main difference

is there is no load information exchange between the cells in the Inter-Frequency

Offload feature.

The Inter-Frequency Offload feature provides the following benefits:

- Certain operators can use the spectrum and equipment in a more efficient way by pushing traffic between the carriers. This applies to operators that have agreements with other operators with overlaying carriers, and operators that have overlaying carriers operated by nodes of different vendors.
- It reduces the risk for a UE to be trapped in an overused E-UTRAN cell providing poor performance.
- It enhances the usage of all frequencies within a network.
- Inter-frequency offload can be applied in different network topologies where a large number of small inter-frequency cells exists, that are not feasible for load balancing. For example, heterogeneous network or small cell deployments.

| UE Throughput-Aware IFLB (FAJ 121                                     4219)                                  | Related        | UE Throughput-Aware IFLB is an                                     enhancement to the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature.  Throughput-aware UE selection                                     estimates and compares possible UE throughput in the                                     cellbefore                                     using a UE for load balancing. A decision on                                     whether to move the UE or not is based on the throughput                                     difference.  When uplink-heavy UE detection and exclusion are active in a                                     cell, the UE might be moved to a neighbor cell before it is                                     identified as uplink-heavy. If it is detected as uplink-heavy in                                     the serving cell it was moved to, it might be immediately moved                                     back to the source cell. After the last handover, the UE is                                     identified as uplink-heavy and is not chosen for further                                     load-balancing actions as long as it is marked as                                     uplink-heavy. |

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-Frequency Offload

The Inter-Frequency Offload feature is part of the Load Management features in LTE RAN.

It is used to offload traffic to the E-UTRAN network if the traffic load in the E-UTRAN cells

exceeds a configured level. Load balancing relations are configured between two E-UTRAN cells.

Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Inter-Frequency Offload

Process Steps

1. The traffic load in a cell is assessed repeatedly in certain intervals of a load balancing cycle. The current subscription ratio of the cell is calculated. The QCI subscription quanta values (QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta and QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta) of all E-RABs (both GBR and non-GBR services) present in the cell are added. The sum is divided by the cell subscription capacity that is the value of EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attributes. The subscription ratio determines further load balancing actions in the cell.
2. Based on the configured E-UTRAN trigger offload threshold, each source cell determines the amount of traffic load to be handed over to each target cell to balance the load differences. The configured E-UTRAN trigger offload threshold can be one of the following: EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranTriggerOffloadThreshold EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranTriggerOffloadThreshold This step can be done based on the following:: If multiple target cells exist, the load difference is split between these cells. Note: The excess load in the source cell is typically not offloaded in a single round of load balancing actions. To remove the excess load, several rounds are required. By increasing the offload capacity for the target cells with the EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity attribute, the number of required rounds is reduced.
    - The load amount is proportional to the load difference between the source cell subscription ratio and threshold EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranTriggerOffloadThreshold or EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranTriggerOffloadThreshold.
    - The load amount cannot exceed the maximum load difference in the source cell in one round of the load balancing cycle. The maximum load difference is shown by the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCeiling attribute.
    - The load amount is proportional to the offload capacity of the target cell, EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity.
    - The load amount is inversely proportional to the sum of the subscription capacity of the following: The source cell The possible target cells for inter-frequency load balancing, or inter-frequency offload, or both The sum of the subscription capacity can be described by EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute.The possible target cells are those to which the attribute EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing is set to ALLOWED, OFFLOAD, or IFO\_AND\_IFLB.
3. The UEs that are suitable for offload are selected. When the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, the following applies: Note: Enabling subscriber group-based UE selection for offload requires the following configuration: Priority cells reference cell profiles where PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY. PtmFunction.ptmEnabled is set to TRUE. UEs are selected for offload based on the priority of their subscriber group. Up to 12 subscriber groups can be defined. Offload candidate selection works only on cells that reference PRIORITY Preferential Traffic Management cell profiles. To define the order in which UEs are offloaded by Inter-Frequency Offload, there is a need to configure the PtmIfoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef list in the referenced cell profile. Groups at the top of the list are offloaded earlier as they have lower priority. Note: SPID-based UE selection for Inter-Frequency Offload requires X2 connection between the nodes for cells on different nodes. For more information, see Preferential Traffic Management Guidelines. When uplink-heavy UE detection for the Inter-Frequency Offload feature is configured and a UE is marked as uplink-heavy, it is excluded from load-balancing mobility actions. For more information, see Uplink-Heavy UE Detection. In the UE selection process, the UEs perform inter-frequency A5 measurements on the target frequency. This ensures that the UE has acceptable coverage in a target cell. Only those UEs are selected which support the target frequency band and trigger an A5 measurement report on the target cell. Note: The A5 measurement also enables load balancing actions for UEs that are configured for Carrier Aggregation. The maximum number of measurements started for load balancing purposes during a 15-second load balancing cycle is limited. Note: A UE in connected mode is selected to perform a measurement on a target frequency for load balancing purposes at most once for each load balancing cycle. In case all target cells for a frequency have a back-off timer running, no UE measurements are started for that frequency.
4. The execution of load balancing actions is performed by handover of the selected UEs to the target cells. The handover of UEs is performed using the following normal inter-frequency handover procedures: X2 Handover Preparation S1 Handover Preparation RRC Connection Reconfiguration Handover to a target cell is inhibited in the following cases: The EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute for the target cell is set to FALSE. The cell is listed as forbidden in a HRL provided for the UE. For more information on the support of HRL, see Shared LTE RAN. The RFPM function of the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is used. The FreqPrioEUTRA.loadBalancingAllowed attribute related to the RATFreqPrio MO for the target carrier frequency is set to FALSE for matching UE SPID.Note: If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is used, to inhibit inter-frequency offload for load balancing relations is inhibited. It can be achieved by setting the EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute to IFO\_AND\_IFLB, and the FreqPrioEUTRA.offloadAllowed attribute must also be set to FALSE. Otherwise, if the FreqPrioEUTRA.loadBalancingAllowed attribute is set to TRUE or there is no matching UE SPID, load balancing to the target cell for the UE is allowed. For more information on the support of SPID use, see Subscriber Triggered Mobility. Table 3 Handover Cause Value for Offload-Triggered Handover Handover Type Cause Value Setting Standard S1 handover The cause value is set in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message according to the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1SourceTriggersOffload attribute. 3GPP TS 36.413; E UTRAN S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) X2 handover The cause value is set in the HANDOVER REQUEST message according to the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeX2SourceTriggersOffload attribute. 3GPP TS 36.423; E UTRAN X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)
5. A node acting as offload target checks incoming handovers for the handover cause value configured as offload with the following parameters: LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1TargetAcceptsOffload LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeX2TargetAcceptsOffload An incoming offload handover is accepted if the traffic load of the target cell is below the accept offload threshold EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranAcceptOffloadThreshold or EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranAcceptOffloadThreshold. Otherwise the handover is rejected.
6. If the target E-UTRAN cell rejects the load balancing action handover, the source cell temporarily removes the E-UTRAN cell from the set of offload target cells. The E-UTRAN cell is restored in the set of offload target cells after a configurable back-off time, LoadBalancingFunction.lbEUtranOffloadBackoffTime.

## 3.1 Load Balancing Cycle

The load balancing cycle is the time interval between two successive evaluations of

traffic load balancing status. It is  the time frame for the actions attempting to restore

the traffic load balance.

Load balancing between cells is done repeatedly in successive load balancing cycles of 15

seconds.

| UE Selection for Load Balancing Action |    | The UEs suitable for offload are selected.

Some suitable UEs are moved to detected target cells by inter-frequency                         handover. |

## 3.2 Load Balancing Relation

The load balancing relation is the logical relation between a load balancing source

and a target cell. Load balancing relations are controlled with the

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute.

For load balancing features to steer traffic from one source cell to a target cell, a

relation must be defined in the source cell. This relation is defined to the target cell

using the EUtranCellRelation MO. The

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute controls whether load

balancing, or offload, or both are allowed.

## 3.3 GBR Traffic Load

GBR traffic is characterized by a relatively persistent E-RAB that generates a steady data

stream. For example, an E-RAB for a voice call typically lasts for one or a few minutes.

During the voice call, a stream of voice packets is transferred at a nearly constant rate.

Therefore, the number of E-RABs for GBR traffic present in a cell is a good basis for the

assessment of the GBR traffic load.

## 3.4 Non-GBR Traffic Load

Non-GBR traffic is typically characterized by short but frequent data transactions. The

individual data transactions can range from a few data packets to the transfer of large files.

Many data transactions are completed within a short time, often less than a few seconds.

Non-GBR traffic has the following pattern:

1. The UE enters connected mode.
2. The E-RABs are established.
3. The data transaction, or a sequence of data transactions proceeds.
4. The UE is released after a period of inactivity.

This pattern is repeated, but each RRC connection and each E-RAB for the node is unique. The

node is unable to correlate the different RRC connections generated by a UE.

Non-GBR traffic patterns are difficult to predict because they change often and quickly. The

activity of an individual UE or E-RAB does not necessarily give much information about the

activity a few seconds ahead. The number of E-RABs presented by the UEs to the LTE RAN can be

used to assess the non-GBR traffic load generated by the UE groups. This applies for a UE

group camped in a cell.

## 3.5 Subscription Ratio

Subscription ratio is a relative traffic load measure. It is the ratio between the

total QCI subscription quanta of all E-RAB instances currently configured in a cell and the

cell subscription capacity of the cell.

It takes a value between zero and one for an under-subscribed cell. Values greater than

one indicate an over-subscribed cell.

Figure 3   Subscription Ratio

The configuration of the following values has to obtain the required load balancing

behavior:

- qciSubscriptionQuanta (in MOs QciProfilePredefined or QciProfileOperatorDefined)
- cellSubscriptionCapacity (in MOs EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD)

This enables load balancing between cells with different UE groups, and cells with

different traffic capacities.

Configuration of the assessment model offers control of the load balancing objectives in

LTE RAN and opportunity for further changes.

The subscription ratio can be used to monitor the traffic load in a cell.

## 3.6 Cell Subscription Capacity

Cell subscription capacity is the nominal traffic handling capacity of a cell. Its value

is an estimate of the total amount of QCI subscription quanta values the cell is

expected to accommodate at full system load. Cell subscription capacity defines the

target for load balancing to divide the traffic load between overlaid cells within the

network. It can be configured with one of the following MOM attribute:

- EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity

## 3.7 QCI Subscription Quanta

QCI subscription quanta is the representation of the anticipated or typical traffic

handling capacity required for an E-RAB with certain QCI.

QCI subscription quanta is configured for a QoS class by setting the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute.

## 3.8 Offload Capacity

The offload capacity moderates the offload amount directed to the target E-UTRAN cell. This

can be achieved with one of the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity

The amount of offload to a specific target E-UTRAN cell is proportional to the

EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranCellOffloadCapacity attribute of that target

E-UTRAN cell.

## 3.9 Load Management and MP Load Control

The objective for the load management functions in the eNodeB is to balance or offload load

when possible. However, the focus is on the air interface load. During the execution of load

management functions the MP processor load may increase. To not affect general traffic

handling, the load management functions are temporarily paused if the MP load control state is

higher than NOT HIGH. For more information, see Basic Load Management.

## 3.10 Uplink-Heavy UE Detection

When uplink-heavy UE detection for the feature is configured, the UE selection process

improves for load-balancing mobility actions. The feature excludes UEs from

load-balancing mobility actions if they are marked as uplink-heavy. The uplink-heavy UE

detection mechanism is applied to all UEs that connect to the LTE cell.

The information about the uplink-heavy state of the UE is stored in the UE context.

# 4 Parameters for Inter-Frequency Offload

Table 4   Parameters

# 5 Network Impact of Inter-Frequency Offload

Capacity and Performance

The purpose of the Inter-Frequency Offload feature is to hand over traffic load that

is above a configured threshold in E-UTRAN cells. Traffic load is handed over from

overused E-UTRAN cells to a configured set of E-UTRAN cells with spare capacity. The

ability to fully use the capacity on all the available and configured E-UTRAN cells

is improved.

The feature enables traffic offload to other E-UTRAN cells if the traffic load in the

own E-UTRAN cells exceeds a configured level. This increases the system capacity and

reduces the risk for a UE to be trapped in an overused E-UTRAN cell.

The Inter-Frequency Offload feature enables to limit the amount of incoming handovers

triggered by offload from another cell. The traffic load in the own cell can exceed

the following thresholds:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbEUtranAcceptOffloadThreshold
- EUtranCellTDD.lbEUtranAcceptOffloadThreshold

In this case, the Handover Preparation is rejected if the Cause is set to the

same value as the value of following attributes:

- For S1 handover, LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1TargetAcceptsOffload.
- For X2 handover, LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeX2TargetAcceptsOffload.

Mobility

The Inter-Frequency Offload feature redistributes users in connected mode from

E-UTRAN cells to other E-UTRAN cells by traffic load triggered PS handover. This

feature can increase the number of PS handovers. Handover is typically performed in

good radio conditions.

The handover cause value for the Inter-Frequency Offload feature is set according to

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1SourceTriggersOffload  and

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeX2SourceTriggersOffload.

The following counters are used to distinguish Inter-Frequency Offload handover from

other types of handover:

- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAttLteInterFLb
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSuccLteInterFLb
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAttLteInterFLb
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSuccLteInterFLb

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Inter-Frequency Offload

## 9.1 Configuration of Load Balancing Relation

Load balancing relations are configured in the source cell towards each target cell, by

setting the EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute.

Table 7   Configuration of Load Balancing Relation

The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute can be configured in one

direction, from the source cell to the target cell.

To apply the same configuration in both directions between two cells,

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing must be set to the same value in both

directions. This allows both cells to act as source cells to each other.

The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute also controls the exchange

of load information. When set to ALLOWED or

IFO\_AND\_IFLB, the source cell requests the target cell to provide

traffic load reports.

Other mobility functionality is not affected by the

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute.

The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute can be determined and

configured automatically by the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature.

## 9.2 Configuration of Subscription Parameters

The operation of the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature requires that QCI subscription

quanta and cell subscription capacity are configured. QCI subscription quanta can be the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute. The cell

subscription capacity can be the EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute.

Configuration of QCI Subscription Quanta

The QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attributes are

configured in proportion to the typical traffic load an E-RAB of the specific QoS

class         represents in LTE RAN at high load. The general recommendation is to choose values for these

attributes in proportion to the expected downlink bit rates (in kbps) under those

conditions.

For a GBR type of E-RAB, the qciSubscriptionQuanta parameter is chosen

in proportion to the typical guaranteed downlink bit rate (in kbps) for the particular

QCI.

Table 8   Recommendations to Configure qciSubscriptionQuanta for GBR E-RABs

| QCI                      | Recommendation                                       |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 (conversational voice) | The value depends on the typical voice codec in use. |
| Other (2..4, …)          | The value depends on the type of streaming media.    |

For a non-GBR type of E-RAB, the qciSubscriptionQuanta parameter is

chosen in proportion to what is considered an acceptable downlink bit rate (in kbps) for a

UE in connected mode in LTE RAN at high load.

Table 9   Recommendations to Configure qciSubscriptionQuanta for Non-GBR E-RABs

The default E-RAB can be distinguished on different QCIs for users of separate categories,

for example, for users with different types of UE devices. It offers a way to differentiate

the qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute values among users of different

categories. This can be useful if there are user categories with widely different QoS

demand.

Configuration of Cell Subscription Capacity

At high load in LTE RAN, the cellSubscriptionCapacity (in MOs

EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD) is configured in

proportion to the achievable traffic capacity in the cell.

The achievable traffic capacity is typically proportional to the RF bandwidth of the cell,

but can also depend on other factors, including the following:

- Inter-site distances and the presence of radio interference from neighbor cells.
- How the cell antenna is configured. For example, whether MIMO is applied.
- How the UE group in the cell is distributed between the cell center and the cell edge.

It is recommended to choose a value of the attribute

cellSubscriptionCapacity in proportion to the achievable downlink bit

rate (in kbps) in the cell, considering the factors affecting the capacity. In a typical LTE

RAN deployment, without advanced antenna configurations, the achievable spectrum efficiency

at high load is usually in the proximity of 2 Mbit/MHz (bit rate for each RF bandwidth).

The amount of E-RABs the cell can accommodate is ultimately a trade-off with respect to the

achievable QoS level. Increasing the amount of E-RABs has the following effects:

- Reduced throughput and increased packet delay for individual (non-GBR) E-RABs
- Increased subscription ratio, with a given configuration of the qciSubscriptionQuanta and cellSubscriptionCapacity attributes
- Declined user experience, yet a still operable cell

Therefore, the subscription ratio can be used as an indicator of the user experience in the

cell.

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature can handle load balancing also at subscription

ratio levels greater than 1.0 (normally conceived as a mark of high load). The upper limit

of the subscription ratio is 16. If the upper limit is reached, the load balancing can

stall, because traffic load differences between cells above the limit are not perceptible.

The value of the cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute should be chosen

large enough to keep a margin with respect to this limitation.

## 9.3 Tuning of Subscription Parameters

In addition to the basic recommendations to configure load balancing, further tuning of the

QCI subscription quanta and cell subscription capacity is possible to improve the load

balancing behavior.

The QCI subscription quanta can be the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta MO attribute. The cell

subscription capacity can be the EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity MO attribute.

For example, if a high E-RAB density of certain QoS class tends to cause the QoS level to

decline. Then an increase of the corresponding qciSubscriptionQuanta

attribute can help to reduce the number of UEs in the cells where that type of E-RAB is

frequent.

The load balancing process does not consider the absolute level of

qciSubscriptionQuanta and cellSubscriptionCapacity.

The relations are important between these parameters.

Relation Between qciSubscriptionQuanta Values for Different QCIs

![Image](../images/186_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.CS/additional_3_CP.png)

The relations between qciSubscriptionQuanta values for different QCIs

determine how UEs with different E-RAB configuration can be exchanged in the load balancing

process.

Increasing the qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute value for one QoS

class         tends to relocate UEs from cells with high density of this type of E-RAB to cells with lower

density. The opposite is also true.

Relation Between cellSubscriptionCapacity Values of Different Cells

![Image](../images/186_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.CS/additional_3_CP.png)

The relations between the cellSubscriptionCapacity values of different

cells determine how the UE group is divided between cells where load balancing is

allowed.

Increasing the value of the cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute for one

cell attracts UEs to that cell. The opposite is also true.

Relation Between cellSubscriptionCapacity and qciSubscriptionQuanta Values

![Image](../images/186_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.CS/additional_3_CP.png)

The overall relation between the values of cellSubscriptionCapacity and

qciSubscriptionQuanta attributes determines the absolute level of the

subscription ratio in the cell.

Increasing the overall ratio between the values of attributes

cellSubscriptionCapacity and qciSubscriptionQuanta

requires a higher number of UEs in the cell to reach the same subscription ratio.

## 9.4 Uplink-Heavy UE Detection Configuration

Uplink-heavy UE detection can be enabled independently for the feature to improve the

UE selection process for load-balancing mobility actions.

The following attributes must be set to

true

to enable uplink-heavy UE detection for load-balancing mobility actions:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled

The following can be used to configure uplink-heavy UE detection:

- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTime
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst

The attributes that configure uplink-heavy UE detection are the same attributes used by

the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility and the Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation features.

Therefore, changing these attributes also affects their uplink-heavy detection

function.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q1: Preferential Traffic Management

The Preferential Traffic Management solution enables the operator to control user access

to priority and non-priority bands. With Preferential Traffic Management, it is possible to

define up to 12 subscriber groups denoted by a list of SPIDs and PLMN with different

selection priority for Inter-Frequency Offload and Admission-Triggered Offload.

| Feature Name:           | System Improvements in LTE RAN L19.Q1   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | 20/FAJ 121 1447                         |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node      |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

The Preferential Traffic Management solution offers the operator the possibility to efficiently

use an LTE network, deployed on several frequency bands, with one frequency band used

primarily for priority users. The solution enables the following:

- To use the priority band for both priority and non-priority users as long as co-existence rules allow it.
- To use the priority band exclusively for priority users in the intended traffic situations.
- To use the non-priority bands for both non-priority and priority users, both as coverage bands and bands to offload priority traffic when the priority band is overloaded.
- To define how Preferential Traffic Management functions treat specific UEs by using subscriber groups.

The load management policies used depend on the current traffic load level. Traffic load

states in the solution are defined by configurable load threshold parameters.

The solution is developed for existing commercial RAN infrastructure with a designated

band used as priority band, using an MOCN architecture. The solution is achieved by a

collection of extensions in existing licensed features, configured to work together.

For more detailed information on Preferential Traffic Management, see Preferential Traffic Management

Guidelines.

Capacity and Performance

The capacity on priority bands is limited for non-priority users and changes with network

congestion level. This is because of the need to provide uninterrupted connectivity

for priority users. During network congestion, an increased drop in mobility success

rate towards priority cells is expected.

Operation

The Preferential Traffic Management solution is activated on node level using the

PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute.

On the eNodeB, a maximum of four cell profiles can be configured, but a cell refers

to only one predefined profile. This controls which Preferential Traffic Management

actions are triggered on the cell. Each cell profile can be configured using the

PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute with the following

settings:

- PRIORITY
- NON\_PRIORITY

UE selection for Admission-Triggered Offload and Inter-Frequency Offload works only

if the PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute is set to

PRIORITY.

The function introduces the following new MO classes:

- PtmAtoConfig
- PtmCellProfile
- PtmFunction
- PtmIflbConfig
- PtmIfoConfig
- PtmResOpUseConfig
- PtmStmConfig
- PtmSubscriberGroup

This function is controlled by the following new parameters:

- PtmAtoConfig.minSuccRateThreshold
- PtmAtoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmCellProfile.cellType
- PtmFunction.ptmEnabled
- PtmIflbConfig.stopIncomingIflbThreshold
- PtmIflbConfig.stopOutgoingIflbEnabled
- PtmIfoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resSRatioThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresSRatioThreshold
- PtmStmConfig.inhibitImpInterval
- PtmStmConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmSubscriberGroup.plmn
- PtmSubscriberGroup.spidList

Handover of UEs with certain PLMN IDs and SPID to a

target cell can be blocked. This occurs when the PLMN ID of the UE is "reserved for

operator use" in the target cell. It can be reserved, because the priority cell has

a very high traffic load-subscription ratio or MSR usage. It is also required that

the SPID of the UE is configured in the PtmSubscriberGroup MO as

the PtmStmConfig MO refers to that group.

The following features are affected by the solution:

This system improvement enables priority UEs to select and access priority cells in

high traffic load when the priority core network is not

available.

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement enhances accessibility for priority UEs as part of the

Preferential Traffic Management solution. It enables priority UEs that utilize

non-priority equivalent home PLMN to connect to priority bands and to fully utilize

priority cell resources under the following circumstances:

- The priority cells are in a high traffic load.
- The priority PLMN core network is not available due to S1-C connection failure.

Capacity and Performance

This system improvement can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedSubRatio
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedSubRatio

Operation

This system improvement introduces the

PtmResOpUseConfig.suspResOpUsePlmnList attribute. This

attribute can suspend dynamic PLMN reservation during S1-C connection failure. The

operator can select priority PLMNs for which the cell reservation is suspended.

If the PtmResOpUseConfig.suspResOpUsePlmnList attribute is empty,

which is the default value, any of the priority PLMNs can suspend dynamic PLMN

reservation for cells during S1-C connection failure.

This system improvement introduces the following PM events:

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces a mechanism to detect uplink-heavy UEs. If a UE

is identified as uplink-heavy, it can be excluded from load-balancing mobility

actions in FDD and TDD cells.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It is possible to detect uplink-heavy UEs for the Inter-Frequency Offload feature.
- The UE selection process is improved for load-balancing actions.
- Ping-pong effect between cells for uplink-heavy UEs is reduced when the Inter-Frequency Offload and the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility features are active at the same time in the network.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement decreases the number of uplink-heavy UE handovers triggered

by the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature.

This

can be observed with the following PM counters in the source

cells where the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature is active:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces attributes to control the detection of

uplink-heavy UEs. When the following attributes are set to true,

UEs marked as uplink-heavy are excluded from load-balancing mobility actions:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.lbUlHeavyUeDetectEnabled

The following existing attributes are updated to control the detection of

uplink-heavy UEs when the Inter-Frequency Offload feature is not active:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulHeavyUeDetectEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.ulHeavyUeDetectEnabled

When uplink-heavy UE detection for load balancing is enabled in the cell, the

mechanism is applied to UEs that connect to the LTE cell through the following

processes:

- Incoming handover
- RRC initial setup
- RRC connection re-establishment

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
