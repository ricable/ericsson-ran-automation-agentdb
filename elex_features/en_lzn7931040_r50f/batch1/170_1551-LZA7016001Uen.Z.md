# 1 Introduction

This document describes the supported power configurations in RBS

6000 (not including RBS 6401) for GSM, WCDMA, LTE, and CDMA. Information

about supported power configurations for RBS 6401 can be found in RBS Description.

Power configurations are ways of combining power units to support

the RBS with enough power for a specific configuration.

It is also possible to connect a Power 6610 for +24 V DC and 230/110

V AC power input. If the optional Battery Fuse Unit (BFU) is chosen,

battery power is available too. If a Power 6610 is used, the RBS 6601

or RBS 6202 controls the power system as an integrated part of the

RBS cabinet.

For information about how to connect a Power 6610, refer to the

documentation in the RBS Site Power Systems library.

This document is intended for use by engineering and Operation

and Maintenance (O&amp;M) personnel as reference material when an

RBS site is engineered.

More information about power units can be found in the respective

unit description.

More information about unit positions and cabling can be found

in Non-RF Connections.

### 2.2.6 Expansion with PSU AC 03

When using a PSU AC 03 in an RBS cabinet that does not have the

PCU AC 06, consider the following:

- The total maximum load must not exceed the maximum load as stated on the cabinet (135 A).
- If the PSU AC is used in a cabinet with a PCF, the following apply:
    - If the PSU AC input current switch is set to 10 A, there is no need to change any other hardware.
    - If the PSU AC input current switch is set to 12.5 A, the PCF must be PCF 01 03. If necessary, change to PCF 01 03 according to instructions in Replacing Power Units.
    - If the PSU AC input current switch is set to 15 A, upgrade the power capacity according to instructions in Upgrading RBS. This upgrade includes changing to a PCU AC 06.

## 2.3 RBS 6110

This section presents the power configurations available for RBS

6110.

RBS 6110 can have both AC and DC as power supply.

The units are to be inserted into the cabinet as instructed in Non-RF Connections. More information

on the power units can be found in their respective unit descriptions.

### 2.3.1 AC Prepared 200 A

This configuration is prepared for up to 200 A. The configuration

always consists of a 4U power subrack, and if necessary, a 1U power

distribution subrack. If the 1U power distribution subrack is not

installed, it is replaced by a dummy plate.

### 2.3.2 AC Prepared 360 A

This configuration is prepared for up to 360 A. The configuration

consists of a 4U power subrack and a 1U power distribution subrack.

An additional 1U power distribution subrack is installed in configurations

where the 24 slots in the first 1U power distribution subrack are

filled. In configurations with 7 PSUs where there is no free slot

for the 7th PSU in the 4U subrack, or configurations with more than

1 PFU, a 1.5U power subrack is installed. If the additional 1U power

distribution subrack or 1.5U power subrack are not installed, they

are replaced by dummy plates.

The configuration can also consist of 2 x 4U power subrack.

Figure 14 shows an example of units

and their placement for the configuration. The number of units that

are installed can vary depending on configuration needs. All empty

slots in the subracks are filled with dummy units.

## 2.4 RBS 6120

This section presents the power configurations available for RBS

6120.

RBS 6120 can have both AC and DC as power supply.

The units are to be inserted into the cabinet as instructed in Non-RF Connections. More information

on the power units can be found in their respective unit descriptions.

### 2.4.1 AC Prepared 200 A

This configuration is prepared for up to 200 A. The configuration

always consists of a 4U power subrack, and if necessary, a 1U power

distribution subrack. If the 1U power distribution subrack is not

installed, it is replaced by a dummy plate.

Figure 16 shows an example of units

and their placement for the configuration. The number of units that

are installed can vary depending on configuration needs. All empty

slots in the subracks are filled with dummy units.

### 2.4.2 AC Prepared 360 A

This configuration is prepared for up to 360 A. The configuration

consists of a 4U power subrack and a 1U power distribution subrack.

An additional 1U power distribution subrack is installed in configurations

where the 24 slots in the first 1U power distribution subrack are

filled. In configurations with 7 PSUs where there is no free slot

for the 7th PSU in the 4U subrack, a 1.5U power subrack is installed.

If the additional 1U power distribution subrack or 1.5U power subrack

are not installed, they are replaced by dummy plates.

The configuration can also consist of 2 × 4U power subrack.

Figure 17 shows an example of units

and their placement for the configuration. The number of units that

are installed can vary depending on configuration needs. All empty

slots in the subracks are filled with dummy units.

## 2.12 Power System Dimensioning

To make a proper power system dimensioning, consider the following:

- The power consumption of the system
- Required battery charging
- Recharging time

The power consumption of the system is dependent on the following:

- Type of radio or baseband
- Transmission
- Configured radio output power
- Load variations because of traffic impact
- Average power consumption over 24 hours
- Power consumption peaks
- Ambient temperature
- Distribution of internal or external hardware (cabinets with a large heat load require more climate capacity)

To ensure that sufficient and supported hardware is used, the total

power consumption for the specific configuration must be known. Use

the power consumption values and methods described in chapter Calculation of Base Station Power Consumption Using Module

Data in Power Consumption Calculations to calculate the

total power consumption.

When the total power consumption has been calculated, it is possible

to calculate the maximum DC system load current used in the system.

This value is calculated by using the total power consumption, in

Watt, and dividing this value with the minimum system load voltage,

for example -43 V. This value is then used to check that it

is lower than the maximum allowed DC system load current supported

in the existing power system configuration.

When these considerations have been taken into account and the

total power consumption has been calculated, the AC and +24 V DC power

system variants are equipped with the required number of PSUs that

is allowed within the maximum capacity. To find the required number

of PSUs, take the total power consumption value and divide it by output

power of one individual PSU (1800 W for PSU AC 01 or PSU 24 01, 2500

W for PSU AC 03). Round the value up to the nearest integer.

Example; 6500 W (calculated power consumption) / 1800 W (PSU output

power) = 3.6 PSU, rounded up to 4 PSU.

For information which PSUs are allowed in different systems and

the PSU's output power, see Section  2.6.1 200-250 V AC Input - DC System Load Up to 135 A, Section  2.6.2 200-250 V AC Input - DC System Load Up to 200 A, Section  2.6.6 +24 V DC Input - DC System Load Up to 135 A, and Section  2.6.7 +24 V DC Input - DC System Load Up to 200 A.

## 2.13 Power Installations
for LTE TDD Radios

This section describes the recommended preventive actions for RBS

installations for LTE TDD radios, RRUSs, and RRULs.

These recommendations are valid for the following types of power

system:

- -48 V DC (RBS)
- 200-250 V AC (RBS) with external batteries (BBS)
- Site power with or without batteries

The following preventive actions are recommended to minimize the

impact of the LTE-TDD generated current ripple:

1. Reduce the physical distance between the RBS/site power to the BBS (external battery cabinet) as much as the site planning allows.
2. Increase the RBS/site power-to-BBS cabinet cable area. Ensure a maximum voltage drop of 0.4 V in the battery cable in battery discharge mode.
