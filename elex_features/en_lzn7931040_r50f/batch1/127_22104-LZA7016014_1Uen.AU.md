| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                         |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

The PDCCH Power Boost feature has the following benefits:

- Improved system capacity because of an increased number of scheduled users per TTI, especially for voice (VoLTE or PTT) traffic
- Increased cell coverage for, for example, beam-forming (TM7 and TM8) and heterogeneous network scenarios because of an increased PDCCH coverage

# 3 Feature Operation of PDCCH Power Boost

The PDCCH Power Boost feature calculates the power boost value and the CCE aggregation

level.

The PDCCH element and power are key resources of PDCCH transmission. Without this feature,

only CCE resources are taken into account.

PDCCH power is a fixed value which enables PDCCH power, but wastes CCE resources. The PDCCH

Power Boost feature increases the efficiency of resources and improves the system capacity by

calculating the power boost value and CCE aggregation level. The feature also improves cell

coverage when the maximum aggregation level and the maximum boost power are allocated.

CCE Allocation is a basic function introduced as part of LTE basic, which is the baseline of

the PDCCH Power Boost feature.

The PDCCH Power Boost feature supports bandwidth of 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz. The boost is

for UE-specific search space rather than common search space.

Operational Process

1. The feature calculates the CCE aggregation level and boosts value based on the CCE cost and the PDCCH SINR from the PDCCH Link Adaptation feature. The UE is supported to calculate the corresponding CCE aggregation level and boost power at any cell position.
2. Given by the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or the EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax MO attribute, the requested maximum boost power level is validated against the available PDCCH power in the control region.

# 4 Network Impact of PDCCH Power Boost

The PDCCH Power Boost feature improves cell capacity and coverage.

Capacity and Performance

If the feature is activated, the cell capacity measured as the average number of scheduled

PDCCHs for each TTI is increased in high load VoIP conditions.

If the feature is activated to increase the PDCCH PSD level for CCE aggregation level 4 or

8, the PDCCH cell coverage is increased. This means that the value of

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax attribute is higher than

0.

The feature is especially suitable for a TM7/TM8 scenario where PDSCH does not limit cell

coverage, or it can be applied to all other transmission modes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact

# 7 Activate PDCCH Power Boost

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011515 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate PDCCH Power Boost

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011515 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
