Summary

The Scheduler feature distributes radio interface and RBS

resources between various user and control data flows requesting transmission in the

cell. It gives priority to robust system control signaling and retransmissions over

user data. It enables users to be multiplexed and scheduled in time and frequency,

efficiently using spectral and hardware resources to optimize user throughput and

cell capacity.

Scheduling, also referred to as DRA, is done dynamically

for every TTI of 1 ms. For every upcoming TTI, the Scheduler determines the users

that are assigned radio interface and RBS resources.

The Scheduler feature is a basic feature, and part of

radio resource management. It adapts automatically to variations in traffic load and

distribution, and considers possible UE limitations, reducing the need for

configuration and optimization by operators. However, the operator can control some

of the scheduler behavior, such as for PDCCH and PUCCH resources, to meet specific

needs. These adjustments can have a direct impact on user peak throughput and cell

capacity.

The feature supports SU-MIMO in the downlink, which

improves coverage and peak bit rates.

radio network to prioritize and allocate resources.

Figure 1   Scheduler Interactions Overview in Uplink and Downlink

Process Steps

1. At the beginning of each TTI, the Scheduler feature receives information on radio resources, channel conditions, and data to be transmitted.
2. If resources are available, the Scheduler checks the Baseband capacity.
3. A UE to be scheduled is validated to ensure that it is available for data transmission and it is synchronized.
4. A UE to be scheduled is chosen based on the priority and scheduling weight of its radio bearers.
5. If a UE is validated, the Scheduler feature, together with Link Adaptation and Power Control, allocates an appropriate amount of resources to the UE. PRBs are allocated as scheduling elements on a subframe/TTI basis. Transport format selection, which determines the TBS and transport format, is conducted by the Link Adaptation function.
6. The Scheduler receives feedback on channel quality.

## 3.1 Process Steps for Downlink Scheduling

1. At the beginning of each TTI, the Downlink Scheduler receives the following information:
    - List of available PRBs
    - Available downlink power in the cell
    - PDCCH resources
    - Logical channels with data to transmit
    - Estimate of current radio conditions (channel quality)
    - Number of OFDM symbols for user data
2. If resources are available, the Scheduler checks the Baseband capacity.
3. A UE to be scheduled is validated to ensure that it is available for receiving data and it is synchronized.
4. A UE to be scheduled is chosen based on the priority and scheduling weight of its radio bearers. As the Downlink Scheduler has full observability over all radio bearers (logical channels), it can determine the exact radio bearers that transmit data in one subframe.
5. If the Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature is activated and predefined conditions are satisfied, remaining scheduling procedures can be skipped on that TTI. For more information, see Low Energy Scheduler Solution.
6. If a UE is validated, the Scheduler assigns an appropriate number of PRBs to the UE. PRBs are allocated from lower frequencies to higher, that is from left to right. The proportion of the downlink bandwidth used by the downlink Scheduler can be configured using MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion. The allocation can start anywhere within the available range, and wraps around if reaching the end of the range. When ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation is enabled in downlink, using MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive or EUtranCellTDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive, the starting location of the PRB for resource allocation is ignored. However, the proportion of the downlink bandwidth to be used by the downlink scheduler specified by the EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion MO attribute is still respected. When ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation is disabled in downlink, the manually specified starting location of the physical resource block configured with the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute or theEUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute is ignored, but the proportion of the downlink bandwidth to be used by the downlink scheduler specified by the EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion parameter is still respected. Note: Using only a fraction of downlink bandwidth can affect downlink peak throughput and capacity negatively. For more information, see ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation.
7. The downlink Scheduler receives reports on CQI as feedback on channel quality. The CQI is sent in uplink on PUCCH or PUSCH. PUSCH provides reports with high frequency for each sub-band when there is data to transmit. PUCCH gives wide band average reports with low frequency to track pathloss when there is no data to transmit to the UE. The number of CQI resources available on the PUCCH can be configured with MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers or EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers.

## 3.2 Process Steps for Uplink Scheduling

Figure 2   Uplink Scheduling Procedure

1. A UE to be scheduled sends a scheduling request to the uplink Scheduler to indicate that it has data in the buffer, and asks uplink scheduling to start allocating uplink PRBs to the UE in upcoming subframes. Scheduling requests are sent on PUCCH and uses PUCCH format 1. The number of scheduling request resources available on the PUCCH per cell can be configured with MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers.
2. At the beginning of each TTI, the Uplink Scheduler receives the following information: PUCCH and PRACH have absolute priority over other control and user data channels in the uplink. So the scheduling elements for uplink scheduling are the resources not used by PUCCH and PRACH.
    - List of available PRBs
    - Logical channels with data to transmit
    - Scheduling requests, indicating that there is data in the UE buffer requested to be scheduled
    - BSR, indicating uplink buffer status of the UE
    - Information on power headroom
3. If resources are available, the Scheduler checks the Baseband capacity.
4. A UE to be scheduled is chosen based on the priority and scheduling weight of its radio bearers. As uplink scheduling involves both the node and the UE, resources are allocated per UE. When the Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling feature is activated and enabled in the cell, large-buffer UEs with good channel conditions, that is, data-aware UEs, are given increased scheduling weight. This ensures that data-aware UEs are scheduled more frequently, and more uplink PRBs are allocated to them when scheduled.
5. A UE to be scheduled is validated to ensure that it is in RRC Connected state, synchronized, and data is in the buffer. The random access response message on PDSCH contains the grant for random access message 3 (RRC connection request).
6. When a UE is scheduled in a subframe, the uplink Scheduler allocates resources to the UE. The uplink Scheduler grants some resources to every UE using normal HARQ operation which is given the possibility to receive a grant in that TTI. The uplink Scheduler determines the number of PRBs allocated to a UE based on BSR and channel quality information. Note: FDD only: UEs configured for TTI Bundling transmit in four consecutive TTIs after reception of a grant in that TTI. When ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation is enabled in uplink, using the EUtranCellFDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive or EUtranCellTDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive MOM attribute, a random selection is made as to the allocation must start at the lower or the upper part of the spectrum.
7. The maximum number of scheduling requests can be set by the EUtranCellFDD.dsrTransMax orEUtranCellTDD.dsrTransMax attribute. Note: After the set number is reached, the UE connection fails on PUCCH, and the Random Access procedure starts.
8. The uplink Scheduler sends a scheduling grant to the scheduled UE, indicating the PRBs and transport format to use for uplink transmission. Uplink grants are sent on PDCCH.
9. The UE transmits the uplink data, and together with it sends the BSR to the node.

## 3.3 Scheduling Channels

The resources handled by the feature are listed in the following table:

Table 2   Resources for Downlink and Uplink Scheduling

| Direction   | Resources                                                                                              | Description                                                                                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Downlink    | PRBs     PDCCH resources     Transmitting (TX) rank (layers)     Baseband module processing capability | Downlink scheduling resides entirely in the node.                                                             |
| Uplink      | PRBs     PUSCH resources     Baseband module processing capability                                     | In uplink, both the node and the UE are involved in the scheduling                                 procedure. |

The channels controlled by the Scheduler feature are shown in Figure 3. The channels in the

figure have the following functions:

| Logical channels   |    | Type of information (traffic or control)          |
|--------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                   |
| Transport channels |    | Common, shared, multicast, and broadcast channels |
|                    |    |                                                   |
| Physical channels  |    | Bits, symbols, modulation, and radio frames       |
|                    |    |                                                   |
| Physical signals   |    | Layer 1 information                               |

Figure 3   Scheduler Control of Channels

The Scheduler feature controls all radio interface resources, except the following

physical signal and channel transmissions:

- Reference Signal
- SRS
- SCH
- PBCH
- PHICH
- PUCCH
- PRACH
- PCFICH

## 3.4 Scheduling Element

The smallest unit the feature can assign to a UE is a scheduling element. Scheduling

elements can contain both user data and control data. One  scheduling element consists

of two consecutive resource blocks, so it contains 12 subcarriers (180 kHz) in the

frequency domain, and 1 ms in the time domain, as it is shown in the following figure.

Figure 4   Scheduling Element in Time and Frequency Domain

## 3.5 Scheduling Priority

Scheduling Priority

The Scheduler feature, in every cell in every TTI, determines which UE is assigned

resources. Scheduling is based on priorities, that is, the scheduling weight

attached to the radio bearers.

A higher scheduling priority gives the radio bearer a higher probability to obtain

resources, and enables the UE to perform transmission or reception. Resources are

allocated per UE. The UE priority is defined as the highest scheduling priority of

the radio bearers belonging to the UE, including retransmissions. The UE with the

highest priority is selected first for transmission.

Among logical channels, common channels are given the highest priority:

- BCCH, for system information data
- CCCH, for random access messages
- PCCH, for paging messages

These transmissions are given scheduling weights so that the transmissions get

absolute priority. These transmissions also have link adaptation. Link adaptation is

done to reach the cell edge with a certain probability of decoding, determined by

the link budget.

The Scheduler can allocate the remaining resources to DTCH, after the resources for

Layer 1 and Layer 2 control signaling have been allocated.

Downlink Scheduling Priority

Downlink Scheduler has full observability over all radio bearers (logical channels)

and can determine the exact radio bearers that transmit data in one subframe.

Downlink scheduling priorities are shown in Table

Table 3   Downlink Channel Priority

| Direction   | Channel Priority                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Downlink    | 1. Common channels               |
| Downlink    | 2. HARQ retransmissions of DCCH  |
| Downlink    | 3. Initial transmissions of DCCH |
| Downlink    | 4. HARQ retransmissions of DTCH  |
| Downlink    | 5. Initial transmissions of DTCH |

Uplink Scheduling Priority

Uplink scheduling is done on a UE basis. So, while a UE is selected based on the

priority of one of its radio bearers, it uses its scheduling grant to transmit by

all of its bearers, including those with lower priority.

Uplink scheduling priorities are shown in the table:

Table 4   Uplink Channel Priority

| Direction   | Channel Priority                           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Uplink      | 1. Transmission of random access message 3 |
| Uplink      | 2. HARQ retransmissions                    |
| Uplink      | 3. Initial transmissions of DCCH           |
| Uplink      | 4. Initial transmissions of DTCH           |

HARQ retransmissions are given higher priority than both DCCH and new data

transmissions on DTCH, because synchronized HARQ retransmissions are used.

## 3.6 Scheduling Algorithm

The Scheduler allocates resources based on scheduling algorithms. This can be configured

on cell level. With QoS Aware Scheduler the algorithm can be configured per QCI.

Table 5   Available Scheduling Algorithms

# 4 Network Impact of Scheduler

Capacity and Performance

The downlink and uplink scheduling algorithms distribute and use the RAN resources

dynamically and automatically.

The configurable amount of PUCCH resources for scheduling request and CQI enables the

operator to balance the number of supported users with uplink peak throughput.

Table 6   Capacity and Performance Impact of the Scheduler

| Function               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uplink Data Throughput | There is a trade-off between uplink peak data throughput and the                                     amount of PUCCH resources configured using the following                                         attributes:  EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers or                                                   EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers     EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or                                                   EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers                                                |
| Latency                | There is a trade-off between the delay of scheduling requests and                                     CQI reports on the one hand, and the amount of PUCCH resources                                     configured using the following attributes on the other:  EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers or                                                   EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers     EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or                                                   EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers |

If the EUtranCellFDD.dsrTransMax orEUtranCellTDD.dsrTransMax attribute is set up correctly, it is

possible to decrease uplink latency.

The uplink coverage can be increased by using ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation.

The uplink interference management feature selects the starting point in frequency

randomly to be either the lowest or highest possible frequency. It is possible to

limit the amount of frequency resources allocated by the uplink scheduler.

FDD only: The uplink coverage for UEs using a VoIP service can be increased by using

the TTI Bundling feature.

downlink, and ulInterferenceManagementActive in uplink

(in MOs EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD) being

TRUE. The function can be disabled by setting the respective

parameter to FALSE. The operation of the function is shown in the

table:

Table 7   Operation of ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation

| Direction   | Enabled                                                                                                                                           | Disabled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Downlink    | The starting location of the PRB for downlink resource allocation is                                 selected randomly                            | The start frequency offset for the downlink allocation can be                                 specified as a percentage using the MOM parameter EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart                                 or EUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart. |
| Uplink      | A random selection is made as to the uplink allocation must start at                                 the lower or the upper part of the spectrum. | The start frequency offset for the uplink allocation can be specified                                 as a percentage using the MOM parameter EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart                                 or EUtranCellTDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart.   |

The proportion of the downlink bandwidth used by the downlink Scheduler can be configured

using MOM parameter EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion. The

allocation can start anywhere within the available range, and wraps around if reaching

the end of the range.

The proportion of the uplink bandwidth used by the uplink Scheduler can be configured

using MOM parameter EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion. The

allocation can start anywhere within the available range, and wraps around if reaching

the end of the range.

The maximum number of scheduling requests can be set by the

EUtranCellFDD.dsrTransMax or

EUtranCellTDD.dsrTransMax attribute. After the set number is

reached, the UE connection fails on PUCCH, and the Random Access procedure starts.

Setting the attribute too low, for example from 64 to

4, can increase the number of random access processes in the cell,

increasing the load and reducing the capacity.

EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers or EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers.

In uplink scheduling, the number of scheduling request resources on PUCCH per cell can be

configured with MO attribute The number of CQI resources available on PUCCH per cell can be configured with MO

attribute EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers.

The values of both attributes noOfPucchCqiUsers and

noOfPucchSrUsers must be set according to the following rules:

- The values must not be set to 0.
- For FDD: the maximum values depend on cell bandwidth. The number of CQI resources available on PUCCH per cell can be configured with MO
- For TDD: the maximum values depend on cell bandwidth and the number of cells.
- The values must not violate the limits on maximum number of PUCCH PRBs per cell, as defined in Control Channel Dimensioning.

The PSD for power control of PUCCH and PUSCH is configured by parameters pZeroNominalPucch and pZeroNominalPusch (in MOs

EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD). The

parameters provide target values for received PSD.

Increasing the values of parameters pZeroNominalPucch and

pZeroNominalPusch results in higher signal power. This also

results in increased inter-cell interference, which may affect cell edge UEs. Decreasing

the values of the parameters has the opposite effect.
