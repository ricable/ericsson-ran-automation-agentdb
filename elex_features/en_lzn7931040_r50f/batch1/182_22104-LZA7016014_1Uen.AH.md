# 1 Enhanced Cell ID User Plane Location Support Overview

The feature allows to keep the location node updated through OSS about the geographic

data of the cells served by the RBS.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0864                                             |
| Value Package Name:     | Location Support                                         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

An update is sent when any of the geographic cell parameters change. The location node uses

this cell data for UE positioning calculation. The calculation is based on the UE

measurements reported by the UE. The location node in the user plane architecture is

the SLP.

The enhanced cell ID method gives a sufficient positioning accuracy (200-300 m) to serve as a

fallback method for the A-GPS method. The enhanced cell ID method also allows to

comply with the FCC phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning of emergency

calls.

Enhanced cell ID positioning can serve as the positioning method for a wide variety of

commercial services based on UE location.

# 2 Dependencies of Enhanced Cell ID User Plane Location Support

The feature has a dependency to a location node being present in the

network.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following are required to use the feature:

- A location node (SLP) is defined and available in the network.

# 3 Network Impact of Enhanced Cell ID User Plane Location Support

The feature has no impact on the capacity, interfaces, and other network elements of

the network.

## 3.1 Privacy Functionality for Enhanced Cell ID User Plane Location Support

This feature in the RBS enables the operator to keep the location node updated, through

the OSS, about the geographic data of the cells served by the

RBS. An update is sent whenever a change occurs in

any of these cell parameters. The location node uses this cell data when calculating the

UE positioning based on the UE measurements reported by the UE.

The UE position accuracy is in the range of 200-300 meters.
