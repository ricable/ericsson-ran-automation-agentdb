# 1 Multi-Clustered PUSCH Overview

The Multi-Clustered PUSCH feature allocates two non-contiguous fragments to a single

UE to eliminate uplink frequency spectrum fragmentation.

Summary

An uplink frequency spectrum can be fragmented with one or several gaps. The feature

is used to eliminate that fragmentation.

The feature has the following benefits:

- UE peak rate is increased and spectrum efficiency is improved when the uplink spectrum is fragmented.
- Cell throughput is increased in low-loaded cells with fragmented uplink spectrum.

Hardware

This feature is not supported on AIR 3283 and AIR 3284.

Limitations

Multi-Clustered PUSCH in TDD cells is not supported.

In some cell configurations, Multi-Clustered PUSCH feature does not support a single

UE to use the entire available uplink spectrum for PUSCH, Multi-Clustered PUSCH

scheduling needs to fulfill the 3GPP rules of RBG alignment for each cluster, and

total PRBs need to fulfill the same requirement as legacy PUSCH. For more

information about this feature and related topics, see the following

documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.211; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical channels and modulation
- 3GPP TS 36.212; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Multiplexing and channel coding
- 3GPP TS 36.213; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures

Network Requirements

No specific network requirement.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multi-Clustered PUSCH

If the feature is activated, the feature-specific capability is retrieved from the

UeCapabilityInformation RRC message at the UE attach

procedure.

The Multi-Clustered PUSCH feature is only applied when there are more fragments available

than UEs to be scheduled. Multi-Clustered PUSCH does not apply if the buffer of UEs can

be emptied by using just one fragment.

The EUtranCellFDD.clusteredPuschMprFactor can also be used to permit

more clustered PUSCH in a cell. Power backoff can be applied by UEs to fulfill the 3GPP

requirement for outband emission. UEs are free to use any power backoff not larger than

MPR defined in 3GPP.

The EUtranCellFDD.clusteredPuschMprFactor is a multiplication factor

used in link adaptation to the proposed 3GPP MPR value. For example, if the majority of

the UEs in the cell use lower power backoff than the 3GPP-specified MPR value, the

EUtranCellFDD.clusteredPuschMprFactor can be tuned down from the

default 100% and the other way round. Accurate adjustment of this value improves the

cell throughput.

# 4 Network Impact of Multi-Clustered PUSCH

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network capacity or

performance.

# 5 Parameters for Multi-Clustered PUSCH

The feature can only be configured with the associated parameters in the FDD

cells.

Table 2   Parameters

# 6 Performance of Multi-Clustered PUSCH

The benefits of the feature are monitored through the uplink throughput.
