Summary

The Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature allows for the efficient use of the PDCCH

resources while ensuring the quality-of-service requirements.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved system capacity because of an increased number of scheduled users for each TTI, especially for voice (VoLTE or PTT) traffic
- Better control and monitoring of the PDCCH error rate
- Better voice quality because of the independent control of the VoLTE uplink PDCCH error rate

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

If the Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature is activated, a small degradation in

retainability can be observed as a trade-off for the capacity gain.

Network Requirements

The following requirement must be fulfilled at feature activation:

The Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature license must be installed.

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation

The channel quality measurement reported to the node by each user is subject to

measurement errors. The PDCCH Link Adaptation compensates for these imperfections by

adjusting the reported measurement.

The basic PDCCH Link Adaptation uses the PDSCH transmission success and a configurable

offset to achieve the target Block Error Rate (BLER) for PDCCH transmissions.

Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation is based on PDCCH transmission success. It uses the PDSCH

HARQ-ACK feedback and the PUSCH detection results to determine whether a PDCCH

transmission is successful. In addition to achieving the target BLER, it makes efficient

use of the PDCCH resources, which allows increased system capacity.

The SINR estimation is based on the CQI report. For a detailed description, see Power Control.

## 3.1 PDCCH Outer Loop Adjustments

To satisfy the required BLER for PDCCH, the estimated SINR must be adjusted to

compensate for the CQI estimation errors on the PDCCH.

Both an upward step and a downward step are defined based on a target BLER. The outer loop

adjustment is increased by an upward step or decreased by a downward step.

Outer Loop Adjustment Criteria

To determine the outer loop adjustment criteria, Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation relies on

the following elements:

- Success or failure of the PDCCH transmissions: The HARQ-ACK reports and the PUSCH detection results are used for this purpose. If the node detects a user HARQ response, either negative or positive, the PDCCH transmission is considered successful. If no response is detected, the PDCCH transmission is considered failed.The node considers the transmission on the PUSCH as failed if the CRC fails and no valid signal is received.
- Aggressive and conservative PDCCH allocation: The PDCCH allocation is considered conservative if the number of allocated CCE exceeds, within a predefined range, the required number. It is considered aggressive in the opposite case. The outer loop keeps track of adjustments made when allocation is aggressive or conservative, and uses this information to decide how to make the adjustment.

In Time Division Duplex (TDD), this feature is only applicable for UEs that are configured

with HARQ-ACK bundling. Therefore, this feature is not applicable for UEs configured with

Carrier Aggregation.

Target BLER values are configured independently for the following:

- Carrier Aggregation
- VoLTE
- Non-Carrier Aggregation
- Non-VoLTE services

Notes specific to Carrier Aggregation

There are limitations in the standard which lead to ambiguity with HARQ feedback for

Carrier Aggregation. In these scenarios, upward or downward step is not applied to the PCell

outer loop adjustment. This can result in less accurate target BLER control when compared to

the non-Carrier Aggregation case.

The PCell outer loop is updated when only the PCell is used for transmission. This is due

to a reduced number of ambiguities.

The SCell outer loop remains unchanged by this feature.

Notes specific for VoLTE

The outer loop adjustment uses the VoLTE BLER target and parameters for any UE using VoLTE

services regardless of whether Carrier Aggregation is also in use by the UE. A UE is

considered to be using VoLTE services when it is using a QCI bearer with the

serviceType parameter set to VOIP.

By default, VoLTE BLER is configured to be conservative. As a result, it uses a larger

average number of CCEs for each PDCCH message than non-VoLTE UEs.

In FDD, UEs actively using VoLTE services do not receive PDSCH transmissions for any bearer

(regardless of ServiceType) on the SCell if Carrier Aggregation is also

in use. However, if attribute

CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte is set to

TRUE, the following applies for the SCell:

- The UEs receive PDSCH transmissions for the subframes when there is no VoLTE packet within the eNodeB.
- The UEs receive no PDSCH transmission for the subframes from the time interval when a VoLTE packet arrives in the eNodeB and until it departs the eNodeB.

In FDD-TDD carrier aggregation, if the UE is configured with a QCI 1 bearer, any configured

SCells become deactivated. When the QCI 1 bearer is removed, the SCell becomes activated

again. The value of the

CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte attribute does not

impact this behavior.

## 3.2 PDCCH Link Adaptation

Based on the estimated SINR and the calculated outer loop adjustment, the link

adaptation determines the number of CCEs required for the coming PDCCH transmission.

The number of CCEs allocated can be different from the required CCE, since only CCE

aggregations 1, 2, 4, and 8 are allowed.

# 4 Network Impact of Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation

This feature allows scheduling more users simultaneously.

Capacity and Performance

The feature allows efficient use of the PDCCH CCEs. More users are simultaneously

scheduled for each TTI, which increases system capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
