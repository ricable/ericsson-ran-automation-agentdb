# 1 LPPa-based E-CID Support Overview

The LPPa-based E-CID Support feature allows the E-SMLC to initiate UE and eNodeB

measurements for positioning purposes.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3030                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | Location Support                             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

The measurement results are reported to the E-SMLC where the UE positioning is calculated. The

LPPa messages exchanged between the eNodeB and the E-SMLC are carried in S1 AP LPPa

transport messages.

The feature offers the following benefits:

- Allows E-CID positioning of UEs not supporting the LPP protocol.
- LPPa-based E-CID positioning provides the same accuracy as LPP-based E-CID positioning.

Additional Information

The following applies to the LPPa Specific IDs in 3GPP 36.455:

| LPPa Transaction ID      |    | The LPPa Transaction ID identifies messages belonging to the same Elementary Procedure in 							accordance with 3GPP 36.455.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| E-SMLC UE Measurement ID |    | The E-SMLC UE Measurement ID identifies a unique measurement procedure between E-SMLC and 							eNodeB. This implies that eNodeB can handle up to 15 simultaneous 							measurement procedures for the same UE.                                                                                                     |

| eNodeB UE Measurement ID |    | The eNodeB UE Measurement ID identifies a unique measurement procedure between E-SMLC and 							eNodeB.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The eNodeB must be connected to an E-SMLC node, by an MME node.

# 3 Feature Operation of LPPa-based E-CID Support

The LPPa-based E-ECID support feature provides additional measurements for the E-SMLC to

determine a single location estimate for the target UE.

E-CID measurements can be requested in the ECID

Measurement Initiation Request LPPa message. The following measurements

are performed by the UE:

- TA Type 1
- RSRP The optional ECGI is included.
- RSRQ The optional ECGI is included.

The following measurements are performed by the

eNodeB:

- TA Type 2
- Cell-ID The optional E-UTRAN Access Point Position is not included.

Only the UE component (UE RX-TX time difference) is

reported in TA Type 1, because it is more accurate than the eNodeB component.

TA Type 2 is retrieved from RBS Layer 2 on the dedicated

channel, and is not measured on the RACH.

The UE measurements are configured and reported over the

RRC protocol, and contain the following information:

- The UE RX-TX time difference for the serving cell.
- The RSRP and the RSRQ for the serving cell and the strongest neighboring cells.

The UE is configured for periodic reporting by default.

The first measurement report received from the UE is always discarded in the eNodeB.

The discard is caused by the current UE standard, which states that the first UE

measurement report only includes measurements from the serving cell.

The reporting of the measurement results depends on the

request of the E-SMLC:

- If the E-SMLC node requests On-Demand Report Characteristics, the measurement result is returned in the E-CID Measurement Initiation Response message.
- If the E-SMLC node requests Periodic Report Characteristics, the measurement results are returned periodically in the E-CID Measurement Report message. For a periodicity shorter than 1024 ms, the eNodeB responds with the periodicity of 1024 ms. In any other case, the eNodeB responds with the requested periodicity. This ensures that the UE has enough time to send the measurement reports and to avoid failures. Note: If the RDS Location Support (FAJ 121 4833) feature is activated, and the E-SMLC requests S-RSRP measurement along with TA Type 1, RSRP, or RSRQ with a periodicity of 480 ms or 640 ms, the eNodeB responds with the requested periodicity, as required by RDS positioning. If the UE does not have enough time to send the measurement reports, the eNodeB uses the default values of TA Type 1, RSRP, or RSRQ, or the values sent in the previous E-CID Measurement Report message. S-RSRP is not a mandatory measurement and it is measured and included in the E-CID Measurement Report message after 1.7 s.

After receiving the measurement results, the E-SMLC node

combines all results and determines a single location estimate for the target UE.

The periodic E-CID reporting is terminated with the E-CID Measurement

Termination Command message from the E-SMLC.

The reception of Error Indication

triggers the termination of all ongoing measurements for the given UE.

The LPPa protocol connects the eNodeB and the E-SMLC

positioning node. The eNodeB transparently carries the LPP PDUs between the MME to

the UE.

## 4.1 Privacy Functionality for LPPa-based E-CID Support

This feature allows the E-SMLC to initiate UE and eNodeB measurements for positioning

purposes. The measurement results are reported to the E-SMLC, where the UE positioning

is calculated.

The eNodeB provides measurement data to positioning node with messages that can be used

to estimate the location of a UE. The UE position is defined based on enhanced Cell ID

information.

The operator can retrieve some UE positioning information, with more accuracy than just

the Cell ID, without having special UE positioning support. With this feature the

operator can support some UE positioning even if the UE does not support LPP.

# 5 Parameters for LPPa-based E-CID Support

transport messages.

# 7 Activate LPPa-based E-CID Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011372 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate LPPa-based E-CID Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011372 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
