Summary

UpPTS is the uplink part in the special subframe of a TDD configuration. Switching

from downlink to uplink occurs in the special subframe. Suppressing the interference

of UpPTS is important.

The UpPTS Interference Reporting feature improves the troubleshooting of a TDD

configuration by improving the observability of interference with finer

granularity.

# 3 Feature Operation of UpPTS Interference Reporting

This feature provides interference reporting at UpPTS in the special subframe of a TDD

configuration for each symbol, antenna branch, and PRB.

In a TDD configuration, the uplink and downlink subframes coexist on the same carrier

frequency. They are divided in the time domain. There is a special subframe where uplink and

downlink are switched.

See Figure 1 for an example of this special subframe divided

into the following three parts:

- Downlink part (DwPTS)
- Guard period
- Uplink part (UpPTS)

Figure 1   Example of a Radio Frame Structure for a TDD Configuration

The UpPTS Interference Reporting feature measures interference of every symbol in UpPTS for

each antenna branch and PRB. It reports measured interference through PM events.

The number of antenna branches and PRBs to be measured are varying depending on the system

configuration. The number of symbols in UpPTS is fixed to two. The Ericsson system only

supports special subframe pattern configurations where UpPTS has two uplink symbols.

See 3GPP (release 13) TS 36.211 Section 4.2 for more information about special

subframe configuration.

# 4 Network Impact of UpPTS Interference Reporting
