Summary

The Prioritized SR Scheduling feature prevents UEs from reaching the maximum number

of SR transmissions.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Retainability is improved because of reduced control signaling.
- Scheduler efficiency is improved as more resources are available for user data with less control signaling.
- Fairness is improved between UEs because SRs are served with absolute priority independently of which DRBs are configured in the UE.
- Inter-cell interference is improved because fewer SR transmissions are required before the scheduler allocates uplink resources to the UEs.
- The load on the RACH is reduced as UEs do not need to resort to the RACH to request uplink resources. A reduced load on the RACH improves the success rate and the accessibility of the Random Access procedure.

# 3 Feature Operation of Prioritized SR Scheduling

The Prioritized SR Scheduling feature gives priority to the SR which is received from

the UE and also prevents UES from reaching the maximum number of SR transmissions to improve

efficiency.

The uplink scheduler gives absolute priority to the SR received from a UE. The priority of

the SR is raised gradually in every subframe until a scheduling grant is sent to the UE. SRs

that arise between the time of the first SR and scheduling grant are disregarded. These SRs do

not affect the priority.

The SR priority is shifted up if no scheduling grant is sent to the UE after a predefined

amount of time since the reception of the first SR.

The raise in priority ensures that the SR is prioritized by the scheduler. After the priority

raise, the scheduler decides to send a grant. The grant is selected so it is sufficient to fit

in control bits and BSR and small enough to limit free-riding of user data.

| AdmissionControl.ulAdmDifferentiationThr | Affected | The Prioritized SR Scheduling feature increases uplink use of MSR because the high                 priority given to SRs. Because of the increased uplink MSR use, the Dynamic GBR                 Admission Control feature to reject more GBR bearers unless the Differentiation                 Threshold is raised.  The Differentiated Admission Control feature uses the lowest ARP level when                 considering resources scheduled in response to SRs with high priority.  The Prioritized SR Scheduling feature can lower the ARP blocking level in the                 Differentiated Admission Control feature. This can result in more rejections of GBR                 bearers with lower ARP level unless the Differentiation Threshold is raised.  The amount to add to the threshold to keep the same behavior depends on the SR load                 which depends on the traffic pattern. |

A similar differentiation behavior is reached after enabling the feature by                 raising the Differentiation and Overall Thresholds with the same amount.
