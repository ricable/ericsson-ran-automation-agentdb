# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe configuration in the

eNodeB for deployment of an end-to-end LTE Broadcast service. LTE

Broadcast is based on the 3GPP standardized Multimedia Broadcast and

Multicast Service (MBMS). Evolved MBMS (eMBMS) is used to denominate

the MBMS service in Evolved Packet Systems with E-UTRAN (LTE) access.

Throughout this document, the terms LTE Broadcast, MBMS, and eMBMS

are used and are interchangeable. Basic information about configuration

of the LTE Broadcast feature can be found in LTE Broadcast. For a practical deployment case there are, however, aspects

to consider that go beyond the basic feature configuration:

- The configuration is very flexible. There are inter-relationships and dependencies between parameters that must be considered.
- An end-to-end alignment is required with the service layer for LTE Broadcast.
- Sometimes, there are User Equipment (UE) implementations that impose restrictions that must considered for configuration.
- Sometimes, there are interactions with other features that must be considered in configurations.

## 1.1 Assumptions

The reader of this document is assumed to be familiar with the

basics of LTE Broadcast configuration, which is described in LTE Broadcast.

It is assumed that the dimensioning of the subframe resources required

for the broadcast service has been performed before starting the configuration.

## 1.2 Limitations

This document only covers configuration of LTE RAN parts for LTE

Broadcast.

Details of LTE Broadcast configuration is not described in this

document. See LTE Broadcast.

## 1.3 Concepts

Figure 1 shows concepts used in eMBMS

planning and configuration.

| MBMS Service Area (MSA)                         | Defines a geographic area in which a specific service is to be broadcast. A cell can belong to one or more MSAs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |    |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    |
| Service Area Identity (SAI)                     | Is used to identify an MSA, and to route eMBMS control messages to all the cells of an MSA. An MSA can have one or many SAIs associated to it. Each SAI represents a group of cells that belong to the MSA.                                                                                                                                  |    |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    |
| MBMS Single Frequency Network Area (MBSFN Area) | A group of cells which are coordinated to achieve transmission of the same content, using an identical wave form at the same time. A cell can belong to up to eight MBSFN areas.                                                                                                                                                             |    |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    |
| MBSFN area reserved cell                        | A cell within an MBSFN area which does not contribute to the MBSFN transmission. When MBSFN transmission is active for the MBSFN area, the reserved cell does not send unicast traffic on the MBSFN subframes. MBSFN area-reserved cells can be used at the edges of MBSFN areas to reduce interference between broadcast and unicast cells. |    |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    |
| MBMS session                                    | An MBMS session is the basic unit for MBMS service management and delivery. An MBMS session provides a data flow delivery with a defined bit rate. One MBMS session occupies one Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH) for each MBSFN Area.                                                                                                       |    |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |    |

An MSA can include one or more MBSFN Areas.

# 2 LTE Broadcast Deployment

The following case is an example of activities to be performed

by an operator to set up LTE broadcast. The starting point is a broadcast

requirement. This contains the following types of information:

- A geographic area in which the services are to be made available.
- The number of services to broadcast.
- Time and duration of the services.
- The quality of the services to be provided. Here, quality means bit rate and error rate.

Deployment of an LTE Broadcast service can then be divided into

three steps. This is shown in  Figure 2.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 2   Requirement to Deployment Steps

# 3 Initial Network Setup

The initial network setup for LTE Broadcast is done once and contains

the following steps:

- Setup of transport network connectivity for M1 user plane and M3 control plane transport to the eNodeBs. Setup of M1 user plane connectivity is described in LTE Broadcast. Setup of M3 control plane connectivity is described in S1, M3, and X2 Control Plane Connections.
- Setup of time synchronization infrastructure to be used for M1 synchronization operation. This is described in LTE Broadcast.

# 4 Service and RAN Planning

An example case, with planning activities for the service layer

and for the RAN, is shown in  Figure 3.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 3   Service and RAN Planning

The output from the service and RAN planning activities is:

- SAI
    - Output from RAN planning.
    - To be configured in both RAN and service layer.
- MBSFN Area IDs
    - Output from RAN planning.
    - Defines the cells that are to contribute to the MBSFN operation.
    - Reserved cells are decided to minimize interference.
    - To be configured only in the RAN.
- Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
    - Output from RAN planning.
    - Decided during the planning stage for an MBSFN.
    - To be configured only in the RAN.
- Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    - Output from RAN planning.
    - Decided during the planning stage, and along with MBSFN MCS value.
    - To be configured only in the service layer.

- MBSFN Subframes, bandwidth
    - Output from RAN planning.
    - Decided during the planning stage, and along with MBSFN MCS and FEC values.
    - To be translated into a subframe configuration in the eNodeB.

- Temporary Mobile Group Identity (TMGI)
    - Output from service layer planning.
    - To be configured in both the service layer and in the RAN.
    - In the RAN, in the eNodeB, it must be mapped to a Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH).

## 4.1 MBSFN Area Planning

To divide an MSA into MBSFN areas, perform the following steps:

1. Make a Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) prediction of the geographical areas covered by the MBSFN areas, and a suitable ring of surrounding cells at least two sites wide. Make sure to extend the MBSFN areas with reserved cells.
2. Make a statistical analysis of the SINR predictions, and calculate the SINR thresholds for the target coverage probability.
3. Calculate MCS for the MBSFN areas.
4. Assign MBSFN area identifiers to the MBSFN areas.
5. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 with a different set of reserved cells, or without reserved cells.
6. Evaluate the loss of unicast throughput in the reserved cells against the bitrate increase in the LTE broadcast cells.

## 4.2 MCS,
FEC and Subframe Assignment

Figure 4 shows a work flow

for assignment of MCS, FEC and subframes. Methods for calculations

are described in eMBMS Dimensioning.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 4   MCS, FEC and Subframe Assignment

FEC is assigned in the service layer for each service. FEC in all

MBSFN areas in an MSA must be aligned.

In all MBSFN areas, set FEC to the maximum calculated FEC in any

of the MBSFN areas.

# 5 Area Mapping Example - Stadium Deployment

Figure 5 shows recommended area

mapping for a stadium deployment.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 5   Stadium Deployment

The stadium is one MSA. For this:

- Group all orange cells into MBSFNs. Most likely a stadium constitutes a single MBSFN.
- Assign SAIs to all the cells.

# 6 Area Mapping, Regional Deployment, Example
1

Figure 6 shows a first example

of a recommended area mapping for regional deployment.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 6   Regional Deployment, Example 1

In this case, an operator wants to broadcast the same content into

both a rural and an urban area.

- The MSA in this case is made up of both the rural and the urban area.
- The MSA can be divided into different MBSFNs for areas that have similar radio characteristics:
    - Group all green cells that belong to the urban coverage into one MBSFN area, MBSFNu.
    - Group all orange cells that belong to the rural coverage into one MBSFN area, MBSFNr.
    - Assign one SAI for all the cells.
- 1 MSA with 2 MBSFN areas.

# 7 Area Mapping, Regional Deployment, Example
2

Figure 7 shows a second example

of a recommended area mapping for regional deployment.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 7   Regional Deployment, Example 2

In this case, an operator wants to broadcast some common content

for the whole region, and some distinct specialized contents for the

rural and urban areas separately.

- For the common content the configuration in Example 1 is used.
- Two additional MSAs must be defined for the specialized content distribution for the rural and urban area respectively, MSAr and MSAu.
- Two additional SAIs must be defined for the rural and urban specialized content MSAs, SAIr and SAIu.
- For the specialized content in the rural area:
    - Broadcast only on MSAr through SAIr.
    - If the specialized content start and stop times align with the common content, add additional radio resources within the MBSFNr.
    - If the specialized content start and stop times do not align with the common content, create an additional rural MBSFN area, MBSFNr1, for the specialized content.
- For the specialized content in the urban area:
    - Broadcast only on MSAu through SAIu.
    - If the specialized content start and top times align with the common content, add additional radio resources within the MBSFNu.
    - If the specialized content start and top times do not align with the common content, create an additional urban MBSFN area, MBSFNu1, for the specialized content.

# 8 Area Mapping, Regional Deployment, Example
3

Figure 8 shows a third example

of a recommended area mapping for regional deployment.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 8   Regional Deployment, Example 3

In this case, an operator wants to broadcast in a stadium area

that has 4 MSAs:

- MSAw, Stadium West
    - Group all the orange cells into MBSFNw.
    - Assign SAIw to all the orange cells.
- MSAe, Stadium East
    - Group all the green cells into MBSFNe.
    - Assign SAIe to all the green cells.
- MSAc, Stadium Center
    - Group all the blue cells into MBSFNc.
    - Assign SAIc to all the blue cells.
- MSAa: Stadium All = East + West + Center
    - Group all cells into MBSFNa
    - Option 1: Assign SAIa to all the cells.
    - Option 2: Instead of assigning SAIa to all cells, broadcast the services of MSAa to SAIe, SAIw, and SAIc. This alternative is preferred if the number of SAIs is limited.

# 9 Service and RAN Configuration

This chapter outlines the workflow and rules for configuration

of LTE Broadcast in the eNodeB.

## 9.1 MBSFN Area and MCH Configuration Rules

The behavior on RAN resource reservation is the following:

- Start of the first eMBMS session enables an MBSFN area. All the subframes configured for eMBMS in that area are reserved for eMBMS.
- Stop of the last eMBMS session disables an MBSFN area. All the subframes configured for eMBMS in that area are released and can be used for unicast.

The previously described behavior motivates the following rule

for MBSFN area configuration:

- Group services that start and stop at the same time into one MBSFN area.

MCS for data transport is configured for each MCH:

- Map all the MTCHs with the same MCS value into one MCH.

The following limits for configuration of LTE Broadcast exist:

- Up to 48 MBSFN areas can be configured in an RBS.
- Up to 15 MCH can be configured for each MBSFN area.
- Up to 28 MTCH can be configured for each MCH.

Then, there are additional limits for the number of MBSFN areas,

MCHs, and MTCHs that can be active with services simultaneously. See LTE Broadcast.

## 9.2 Service Quality to Subframe Configuration
Workflow

Based on the quality requirements for a specific service, that

is, bit rate and error rate, a corresponding need for eMBMS subframes

to allocate can be calculated. See Section  4.2 . A matching subframe configuration can then be done in the following

steps:

1. Start with the recommended baseline patterns for LTE Broadcast and Unicast coexistence.
2. Apply the following additional rules on the baseline pattern:
    - eMBMS subframes to avoid due to legacy device issue with eMBMS related system information. See Section 9.4.2.
    - Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDOA) Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) configuration. See Section 9.4.1. eMBMS subframe patterns cannot overlap with OTDOA configuration. This is validated at configuration.
    - If a four-frame allocation is used, constraints apply. See Section 9.4.3.
3. Select a subset of the baseline pattern that meets the wanted service bit rate as the final eMBMS subframe pattern.

Figure 9 shows a workflow

for configuration of subframe allocations for eMBMS. In the figure

GBR denotes the Guaranteed Bit Rate for a service.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 9   Service Quality to Subframe Configuration Workflow

## 9.3 Recommended Baseline Patterns

Figure 10 shows recommended baseline

patterns for eMBMS subframe configuration. These patterns have been

chosen to spread out the eMBMS subframes in time. This is a way to

minimize interaction with other features, for example VoLTE.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 10   Recommended Baseline Patterns

The patterns correspond to 20% and 40% subframe allocation respectively.

It is recommended to stay below 40% subframe allocation in order to

minimize impact on other features.

## 9.4 Restrictions for Subframe Allocation

Due to interaction with other features, and limitation in certain

UE implementations, there are subframes that cannot be used for eMBMS.

### 9.4.1 Coexistence with OTDOA

Figure 11 shows an example of configuration

of PRS signals for OTDOA. One PRS is sent with periodicity of 160

ms and offset 11 subframes.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 11   OTDOA Coexistence

eMBMS subframes must not overlap subframes with OTDOA PRSs. This

is validated at configuration by the eNodeB.

### 9.4.2 Legacy Devices Not Supporting eMBMS Related System Information

3GPP specifications mandate sending the eMBMS subframe pattern

in SIB2 so that UEs that are not capable of eMBMS can coexist in the

same network.The subframe patterns in SIB2 enable UEs to differentiate

properly the cell specific reference signals (CRS) on unicast subframes

and eMBMS reference signals sent on eMBMS subframes for channel estimation

and measurements. There are legacy devices which process all subframes,

including eMBMS subframes, as unicast subframes. This degrades decoding

performance and unicast throughput.  Figure 12 illustrates this issue.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 12   Issue With Legacy Devices Not Supporting eMBMS Related System

Information

A workaround for this problem is:

- SIB2 is always sent in sf0.
- eMBMS reference signals must not be sent in any subframe in the radio frame before, or in the one subframe after, the SIB2 scheduling position of sf0.
- SIB2-SIB8 must not be sent in the same System Information (SI) message as SIB13, SIB15, and SIB16.

### 9.4.3 Restrictions
for Four-Frames Patterns

Some UE implementations have restrictions for the use of four-frames

patterns. These are:

- Only radio frame allocation offset 0 or 4 can be used.
- As a consequence of the above, if radio frame allocation period 16 or 32 is used, radio frames number 8, 9, and 10 cannot be used.

Figure 13 and  Figure 14 illustrate the restrictions

for radio frame allocation period 16 and 32 respectively. Radio frame

allocation offsets 4 and 0 respectively have been used in these examples.

### 9.4.4 Coexistence with Cat-M1 UEs

MBMS reconfiguration that changes the subframe reservation in the

cell can cause call drops during the reconfiguration, and paging problems

for up to 24 hours after the reconfiguration.

Longer radio frame allocation periods than 4 frames can waste the

Cat-M1 DL resources, as certain subframes are not used by either MBMS

or Cat-M1. The reason for this is that allocation signaled through

Cat-M1 covers only 4 frames.

## 9.5 Incorporate Planning Results

In the final step, a subframe pattern that matches the bandwidth

needs for the service layer must be selected. In the example shown

in  Figure 16, the GBR committed

to the service layer is 3.0 Mbit/s. In this example, it is assumed

that it corresponds to 15.3% of the bandwidth for a 20 MHz carrier.

That is, 13 out of 80 subframes. It is not possible to select a subset

of 15.3% / 13 subframes from Pattern 1 using the one or four-frame

pattern. Using Pattern 2, a subset of 13 subframes can be selected.

Figure 16   Baseline Pattern Selection

Figure 17 shows a straightforward

subframe allocation based on baseline pattern 2, fulfilling the bit

rate requirement.

## 9.6 MCCH Configuration

Figure 18 shows configuration

of the MCCH channel.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 18   MCCH Configuration

MCCH must be sent on a subframe configured for the corresponding

MBSFN area.

The eNodeB automatically sets up the MCCH to be sent in the first

subframe in the MBSFN area within the period identified by the field

commonSfAllocPeriod. In the example in  Figure 18, the configuration is mcchRepetitionPeriod = 32.

## 9.7 Configuration of MCCH Change Notifications

Figure 19 shows configuration

of MCCH change notifications on PDCCH.

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 19   Notification Configuration for eMBMS

The following applies for configuration of MCCH change notification:

- Ensure that the notification is sent on a subframe configured for any activated MBSFN area.
- Apply 3GPP TS 36.331 requirements to define the radio frames in which MCCH change notification is to be scheduled:
    - Actual notification repetition period common for all MCCHs that are configured = shortest modification period / notificationRepetitionCoeff
    - SFN mod notification repetition period = notificationOffset
    - notificationSF-Index indicates the subframe to use to transmit MCCH change notifications on PDCCH.
- notificationIndicatorTOOLTIPFLAG indicates which PDCCH bit to use to transmit MCCH change notification. It must have different values among MBSFN areas that are active for the same cell.

In the example in  Figure 19,

the configuration is:

- Minimum of mcchModificationPeriodTOOLTIPFLAG = 512
- notificationRepetitionCoeffTOOLTIPFLAG = recommended value 4
- notificationOffsetTOOLTIPFLAG = 0
- notificationSFIndexTOOLTIPFLAG = 3
- notificationIndicatorTOOLTIPFLAG = 0

## 9.8 Service Configuration for eMBMS

Configure the same values on both service level and RAN level for

the following parameters:

- Synchronization Sequence Period. This is configured using MOM Mbms.synchPeriodLengthTOOLTIPFLAG.
- Synchronization Sequence Length. This is configured using MOM MbmsService.syncSequenceLengthTOOLTIPFLAG.

Configure a unique logical channel identity for services within

an MCH. This is configured using MOM MbmsService.logicalChannelIdentity.

TMGIs are defined in the service layer planning stage. TMGIs are

configured using MbmsService.tmgiList.

## 9.9 Mapping MCHs to Subframes

Parameter commonSFAllocPeriod contains the

period during which resources corresponding to the subframe allocation

defined by commonSFAlloc are divided between

MCHs that are configured for the MBSFN area.  Figure 20 shows an example where three

MCHs share the available subframes:

- Total number of subframes available in the common subframe allocation period is 13x4 = 52 subframes.
- In this example the services per MCH have equal bit rate requirements. Subframes are allocated as evenly as possible.
- MCH1 and MCH2 are allocated with 17 subframes. MCH3 is allocated with 18 subframes.
    - sfAllocEndTOOLTIPFLAG for MCH1 = 17-1 =16
    - sfAllocEndTOOLTIPFLAG for MCH2 = 16+17 = 33
    - sfAllocEndTOOLTIPFLAG for MCH3 = 33+18 = 51

![Image](../images/1_10056-LZA7016014Uen.E/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 20   SF Allocation End, Example 1

Figure 21 shows an example with

a single MCH:

- Total number of subframes available in the common subframe allocation period is 13x4 = 52 subframes.
- All the MTCH are multiplexed into one MCH
- sfAllocEndTOOLTIPFLAG for MCH1 = 52-1 = 51
