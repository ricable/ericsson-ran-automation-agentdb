Summary

The Radio Bearer Service feature sets up the communication path between the UE and

the network, both for user data transfer and for control signaling. LTE Basic

functions offer a single DRB for each user. The DRB provides the basic path for

carrying user data packets. The SRBs come with a single DRB, providing the

possibility to send Access Stratum (AS) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages

between the UE and the network.The Radio Bearer Service feature sets up the

communication path between the UE and the network, both for user data transfer and

for control signaling.

The radio bearer contains parameters regarding:

- Bit-rate
- Delay
- Coverage
- Capacity

These parameters are configured through other features, such as Quality of Service. The Single Data Radio

Bearer per User fuction supports a single non-GBR service data flow used for

carrying best effort type of traffic.

# 3 Feature Operation of Radio Bearer Service

The feature manages the communication path setup and release between the UE and the

network.

The EPS bearer concept and the procedures enable the setup and release of bearers in the

eNodeB. This includes bearers for transfer of user data as well as separate bearers for

control signaling.

## 3.1 Bearer Types

In the EPS, a number of different bearers are defined on the different

interfaces. Figure 1 shows the types of

EPS bearers and their use in the network.

Figure 1   EPS Bearer Types

The list of supported bearers and bearer relationships are shown in Table 2.

Table 2   Bearers in EPS

| Bearer          | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Radio bearer    | Carries data over the Uu air interface  Types of radio bearers include the following:    DRB for the user plane     SRB for the control plane     The LTE RAN can support up to eight DRBs and two SRBs for each UE. In order to                 support more than one DRB the Multiple Radio Bearers per User (FAJ 121 0549) feature                 must be activated.  The two SRBs defined by 3GPP are the following:   SRB1 is used for normal RRC signaling between the eNodeB and the UE.     SRB2 is used only to carry NAS signaling and has lower priority than                       SRB1. |
| EPS bearer      | Carries user plane data between the UE and the PDN-GW.  Each EPS bearer is mapped to a DRB, an S1 bearer and an S5/S8 bearer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| E-RAB           | Carries user plane data between the UE and the Serving Gateway (SGW).  DRB and S1 bearer together is called E-RAB.  A one-to-one mapping always exists between an E-RAB and a DRB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| S1 bearer       | Carries user plane data between the eNodeB and the SGW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| S5 or S8 bearer | Carries user plane data between the SGW and the PDN-GW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initial Context Setup                        | Triggered by the MME, sets up the first bearer for user data transfer between the                 UE and the EPC network  During Initial Context Setup, security between the UE and the eNodeB is enabled,                 including encryption and integrity protection. Once the communication path is                 secure, the SRB2 and the first DRB are established.                                 |
| Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment | The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature extends the basic feature                 RRC Connection Re-establishment with more cases where RRC Connection                 Re-establishment is supported.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RRC Connection Establishment                 | Sets up a dedicated signaling connection between the UE and the eNodeB  During this procedure, SRB1 is established. At the end of the RRC Connection                 Establishment, the eNodeB selects the MME to which the UE connects. After successful                 RRC Connection establishment, the UE moves from the                   RRC_IDLE state to the                   RRC_CONNECTED state. |
| RRC Connection Re-establishment              | Triggered by the UE in RRC_CONNECTED state, resumes                 the SRB1 and re-activates the Access Stratum (AS) security without changing                 algorithms  A successful re-establishment is followed by a RRC Connection Reconfiguration                 procedure to resume SRB2 and all DRBs.                                                                                             |
| Transparent Message Transfer                 | Enables sending of NAS messages between the UE and the core network.  Transparent Message Transfer is possible only when the UE is in the RRC_CONNECTED state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| UE Context Release                           | Removes all radio bearers for the UE, triggered either by the eNodeB or the MME  After a successful RRC Connection Release, the UE moves from the                   RRC_CONNECTED state to the                   RRC_IDLE state.                                                                                                                                                                             |

### 3.2.1 Initial Context Setup

Figure 2   Initial Context Setup

The Initial Context Setup procedure is triggered by the MME by sending the S1AP initial

ContextSetupRequest message. This message includes information regarding the

first E-RAB to set up. The security algorithms and security keys to use are also included.

The eNodeB applies the security information and informs the UE with the

SecurityModeCommand message. After this, all data from the eNodeB to the UE

is encrypted and control signaling is integrity-protected. The UE responds with the

SecurityModeComplete message. After this, all data from UE to eNodeB is

encrypted and control signaling is integrity-protected.

After successfully sending the SecurityModeCommand message, the eNodeB

allocates resources for the first DRB and SRB2. The eNodeB configures the UE by sending the

RRConnectionReconfiguration message without waiting for the

SecurityModeComplete message from the UE.

The UE responds with the RRConnectionReconfigurationComplete message and the

procedure is completed after the eNodeB has sent the

InitialContextSetupResponse message to the MME.

### 3.2.2 Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment (FAJ 121

3023) feature extends the basic RRC Connection Re-establishment function with more cases where

RRC Connection Re-establishment is supported

- Re-establishment in a different cell: Re-establishment in another cell in the serving eNodeB. This cell can be on the same or a different frequency. Re-establishment in a cell of another eNodeB, if there is an X2 connection and both eNodeBs are Ericsson eNodeBs. This cell can be on the same or a different frequency.
- Re-establishment during ongoing procedures: Re-establishment during intra-eNodeB handover Re-establishment during X2 handover Re-establishment during S1 handover, including SRVCC to WCDMA and GERAN, with the restriction that the target cell for the re-establishment must be in the same eNodeB as the original serving cell Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by TTI Bundling activation/deactivation Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by measurement configuration except during initial attach procedure Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by add or remove or change of Secondary Cell (SCell) Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration for Scheduling Resource (SR) allocation over PRACH, following Out-of-Sync detection Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by Transmission Mode change Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by E-RAB Setup Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by RRC Connection Re-establishment Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration between inter-vendor eNodeBs

### 3.2.3 RRC Connection Establishment

Figure 3   Message Flow for RRC Connection Establishment

The RRC Connection Establishment procedure is triggered by the UE during the Random Access

procedure. After a successful Random Access procedure, the UE sends the RRC CONNECTION

REQUEST message on the CCCH and starts the Rrc.t300 timer to

control reception of the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message.

During the Rrc.t300 period, the eNodeB allocates the resources necessary

for SRB1 and responds to the UE with the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message on the

CCCH. The RRC CONNECTION SETUP message includes information on the

configuration to use.

The UE applies the received configuration and responds with the RRC CONNECTION SETUP

COMPLETE message, sent on the DCCH. The first NAS message is included in this

message. At this stage the eNodeB selects which MME to connect the UE to.

The eNodeB forwards the NAS message to the MME in the INITIAL UE

MESSAGE S1AP message.

The NAS Redirection procedure is triggered by the MME by sending the

rerouteNASRequest S1Ap message, in case the UE needs a specific service from

other MME within a specific Dedicated Core Network (DCN). This message includes information

regarding Additional GUTI and MME Group ID to indicate the specific MME. The eNodeB selects

the MME using information received from the rerouteNASRequest message.

The eNodeB redirects the NAS message to the specific MME in the INITIAL UE

MESSAGE S1AP message.

#### 3.2.3.1 MME Selection Algorithm

Figure 4   MME Selection Algorithm

Smooth MME selection requires the MME sending the S1 SETUP RESPONSE

message with other RAT-related pool information.

If the registered MME is not provided by the UE, nor by the S-TMSI, nor by the registered

GUMMEI, or not available, the eNodeB selects the MME based on the MME relative capacity

within the default Dedicated Core Network (DCN).

If the registered MME is provided by the UE, either by the S-TMSI or by the registered

GUMMEI, and is available, the following options are applicable:

- If the UE is registered in a specific MME and wants to connect to this MME, the MME cannot make an Attach request (ATTACH) or a TAU. In this case, the UE provides the S-TMSI only. The eNodeB must select the registered MME.Note: The MME code (MMEC) is part of the S-TMSI. MMEC uniquely identifies an MME within an MME pool area. If there are more than one connected MMEs with the same MMEC, the eNodeB might not select the registered MME. In this case, remove the TermPointToMme MO instances with duplicated MMEC, then lock and unlock one of the remaining TermPointToMme MO instances. If the registered MME is not available, the eNodeB selects another MME from the same MME pool which has the same MMEGI. If no such MME is connected to the eNodeB, the eNodeB selects the default DCN MME.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, and the ENodeBFunction.nnsfMode parameter is 0, the eNodeB selects MME based on MME Relative Capacity within the default DCN.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, and the ENodeBFunction.nnsfMode parameter is 1 and the Registered PLMN = Selected PLMN, the eNodeB selects the Registered MME.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, and the ENodeBFunction.nnsfMode parameter is 1 and the Registered PLMN is not the Selected PLMN, the eNodeB selects the MME based on the MME relative capacity within the default DCN.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, and the ENodeBFunction.nnsfMode parameter is 2 and the Selected PLMN is served by the Registered MME, the eNodeB selects the Registered MME.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, and the ENodeBFunction.nnsfMode parameter is 2 and the Selected PLMN is not served by the Registered MME, the eNodeB selects the MME based on the MME relative capacity within the default DCN.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, but the GUMMEI type is mapped and the selected MME does not belong to the default DCN, the eNodeB selects the MME based on the MME relative capacity within the default DCN.
- If the registered MME is provided by the UE in Registered MME category, but the eNodeB has no connection with the MME, the eNodeB selects an MME based on RMMEGI and SPLMN. If the MME within RMMEGI does not exist, the eNodeB selects an MME based on the MME relative capacity within the default DCN.

Selection of MME Based on Relative Capacity

The MME selection is made among all connected MMEs within the default DCN, that serve

the UE Selected PLMN. The selection is weighted randomly, using the MME relative

capacities received in the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

| Indicated in additional GUTI   |    | If the eNodeB receives additional GUTI information from the MME, the                             algorithm selects the MME according to GUTI information, and sends the                                 INITIAL UE message to the MME. The successful                             conditions with additional GUTI are the following:  The connection to the MME exists.     The MME serves the Selected PLMN.      If above conditions are not met, the eNodeB selects the MME with                             MMEGI.   |

Selection of MME Based on Relative Capacity

The MME selection for NAS redirection is made among all connected MMEs within the

default DCN, that serve the UE Selected PLMN. The selection is weighted randomly,

using the MME relative capacities received in the S1 Setup Response

message.

### 3.2.4 RRC Connection Re-establishment

Figure 6   RRC Connection Re-establishment

The RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is triggered

by the UE by sending the RRC Connection Reestablishment Request message

to the eNodeB. The Rrc.t301 timer is started by the UE to control

reception of the RRC Connection Reestablishment message.

During the Rrc.t301 period of time, the

eNodeB re-activates the AS security (without changing algorithms), resumes the SRB1

operation, and sends the RRC Connection Reestablishment message to the

UE.

The Re-establishment procedure is completed by reception of

the RRC Connection Reestablishment Complete message which is sent on the

SRB1 from the UE.

After a successful re-establishment, the eNodeB sends an

RRC Connection Reconfiguration message. This is to resume SRB2, and

DRBs, and to reconfigure the measurement configuration.

It is possible that the target eNodeB cannot interpret the

UE-dedicated configuration in the HandoverPreparationInformation message

sent by the serving eNodeB. If this occurs because of ASN.1 version mismatch, the target

eNodeB can use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE.

An RRC Connection Re-establishment failure happens in the

following cases:

- The re-establishment request is initiated towards a cell other than the serving cell. Note: The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature can handle re-establishment requests that are initiated towards a cell that is not the serving cell.
- One of the following RRC procedures are ongoing: Handover E-RAB Setup E-RAB Release E-RAB Modification UE Context Setup UE Context Release UE Context Modification

The eNodeB responds to the UE with an RRC

Connection Reestablishment Reject message, the ongoing procedure times out

after the value of the Rrc.t301 attribute. The RRC Connection Release

is triggered, causing the UE to go to RRC\_IDLE state.

### 3.2.5 Transparent Message Transfer

The Transparent Message Transfer procedure enables the transfer

of NAS messages between the UE and the MME. The contents of NAS messages

are transparent to the eNodeB. The NAS messages are sent on SRB2 over

the air interface.

### 3.2.6 UE Context Release

Figure 7   UE Context Release

The UE Context Release procedure is triggered either by the eNodeB

or the MME, as described in the following:

- When the procedure is triggered by the MME, the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND S1AP message is sent to the eNodeB. The eNodeB sends the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE RRC message to the UE and then clears all resources related to the UE. The eNodeB ends the procedure by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message back to the MME
- When the procedure in triggered by the eNodeB, the UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST S1AP message is sent to the MME. The rest of the procedure is identical to an MME triggered release. Reasons for the eNodeB to trigger this procedure are the following: Expiry of the inactivity timer Expiry of the extended inactivity timer Different error cases within Radio Connection Supervision For example at Radio Link Failure when the Rrc.t311 timer starts to supervise the selection of a suitable cell to re-establish the radio connection. If the Rrc.t311 timer expires, the RRC Connection Release procedure is triggered.

Table 4 contains mapping of different

release cause values, both internal and S1 cause values, for different

use cases.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
