Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The UE must support TTI Bundling

# 3 Feature Operation of VoLTE Frequency Hopping

VoLTE Frequency Hopping is only used when TTI bundling is enabled. 3GPP allows for

multiple variants of PUSCH Frequency Hopping with different configurations.

The VoLTE Frequency Hopping feature supports inter-subframe Type 2 PUSCH Hopping with one

subband. This results in hopping resources that are mirrored in the center of the bandwidth.

For example, the first and third transmissions of the bundle are transmitted as usual. The

second and fourth transmissions are on frequency resources that are mirrored in the center of

the bandwidth (see Figure 1). As a result, minimum

spectrum fragmentation and maximum frequency diversity is obtained. This configuration of

frequency hopping needs no UE capability. All UEs that support TTI Bundling also support VoLTE

Frequency Hopping.

When a UE is configured to use TTI Bundling through RRC signalling, it transmits PUSCH in

four consecutive TTIs according to the uplink grant. The PUSCH data and frequency resources on

which the data is transmitted in the four TTIs remains identical. When VoLTE Frequency Hopping

is activated, the PRBs for second and last TTI are mirrored around the central frequency. See

the right picture in Figure 1.

# 4 Network Impact of VoLTE Frequency Hopping

The feature might affect the capacity and performance of the network.

Capacity and Performance

Because of the change in the SINR, the feature might affect the distribution of

packet loss, with path loss compared to TTI Bundling feature.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of VoLTE Frequency Hopping

This feature introduces no new

parameters.

# 6 Performance of VoLTE Frequency Hopping

The feature has only associated PM counters, but no KPIs or

events.

# 7 Activate VoLTE Frequency Hopping

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011914 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate VoLTE Frequency Hopping

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011914 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
