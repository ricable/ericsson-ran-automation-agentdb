# 1 Enhanced Cell ID Control Plane Location Support Overview

This feature enables the operator to keep the E-SMLC updated through OSS about the

geographic data of the cells served by the RBS.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1794                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | Location Support                             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

The feature can serve as the positioning method for a wide variety of commercial services

based on UE location. With a positioning accuracy of  200-300 m,

the feature can serve as a fallback method for the A-GPS method. Also, it enables

the operator to comply with the FCC phase 2 accuracy requirements on the positioning

of emergency calls.

# 2 Dependencies of Enhanced Cell ID Control Plane Location Support

An E-SMLC must be defined and available in the network.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

An E-SMLC is defined and available in the network.

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced Cell ID Control Plane Location

This feature keeps the E-SMLC updated about the geographical data of the

cell.

The RBS sends an update whenever there is a change in the geographic data of the cell.

The  E-SMLC uses  this data when compiling the assistance data sent to the UE on the

control plane bearer. In UE assisted mode, it also uses the data when calculating the UE

positioning based on the measurements reported by the UE.

# 4 Network Impact of Enhanced Cell ID Control Plane Location Support

This feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Functionality for Enhanced Cell ID Control Plane Location Support

This feature in the RBS enables the operator to keep the location node updated, through

the OSS, about the geographic data of the cells served by the RBS.

An update is sent whenever a change occurs in any of

these cell parameters. The location node uses these cell data when compiling the

assistance data sent to the UE on the control plane bearer. In UE assisted mode, it also

uses the data when calculating the UE positioning, based on the measurements reported by

the UE.

The UE position accuracy is in the range of 200-300 meters.
