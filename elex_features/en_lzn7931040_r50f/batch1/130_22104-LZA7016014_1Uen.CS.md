Summary

The Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature combines antenna signals from multiple

sector carriers in different cells to increase uplink throughput, especially for UEs

at cell edge.

The uplink throughput gains of UEs at cell edge depend on traffic load and traffic scenario.

The gain is

significant

if the UE is connected to a macro cell close to a micro cell.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature is not supported in the micro RBS.

In an Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group, all sector carriers must

be configured in the same Baseband and must have the same frequency and the same

bandwidth.

Network Requirements

This is a licensed feature. For the feature to be operational, a valid license key

must be installed and the feature must be activated by setting a MOM attribute.

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature license must be activated. For more information about licenses, see License Management.
- The UlCompGroup MO and the SectorCarrier MO must be configured.
- At least two SectorCarrier MOs, complying to the 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier license requirement, must be combined in an UL CoMP group. All bandwidths are supported.

Hardware Configurations

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

Several sector carriers from different cells in an uplink CoMP group can be configured by

this feature. The feature adaptively selects two sector carriers (a primary one and a

secondary one) to receive signals from a UE. When a UE is on the border between two cells, the

combination of the two selected sector carriers can increase the UE uplink throughput.

Figure 1   Overview Concept of Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

The two combined sector carriers are selected based on the following conditions:

- The primary sector carrier is in the serving cell of the UE.
- The secondary one is the best of the others in the same uplink CoMP group.

Feature Operation

Users are targeted with the help of the user selection functionality and the sector carrier

selection functionality.

RBS configurations must be checked to indicate that the Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point

Reception feature can be used.

Figure 2   RBS Configuration Check

Process Steps

1. The license is present for the Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature.
2. The UlCompGroup MO class is enabled and configured correctly.
3. User selection. Only users that meet the user identification criteria are involved in intra-eNodeB uplink CoMP processing. The user identification is done in the following way: If the UE SINR is less than the threshold defined by the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute, the UE is selected as a candidate for uplink CoMP processing.
4. Sector carrier selection. The best sector carrier is selected for uplink coordinated multi-point reception.
5. Uplink coordinated multi-point reception processing.

- For the licenses described in Network Requirements, see License Management for details.
- To check if the UlCompGroup is unlocked, verify the following parameter settings: UlCompGroup.administrativeState is UNLOCKED. UlCompGroup.operationalState is ENABLED. UlCompGroup.availabilityStatus is NO\_STATUS or DEGRADED.
- A sector carrier can only be added or removed when the UlCompGroup.administrativeState parameter is LOCKED.
- An uplink CoMP group can only be deleted when the group is locked.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

The Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature affects the performance of the

network.

Capacity and Performance

Robustness is improved in high uplink traffic load cells, as the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr and the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attributes can be set to

smaller value to rule out more users from Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.

A smaller value might have a negative impact on the following KPIs:

- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput
- UL HARQ BLER

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

## 9.1 Hardware Configurations

### 9.1.1 Sector Carrier Configuration

The Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature supports the following sector carrier

combinations with maximum 8 combining RX antennas in total:

- 1 RX sector carrier + 1 RX sector carrier
- 2 RX sector carrier + 1 RX sector carrier
- 2 RX sector carrier + 2 RX sector carrier
- 4 RX sector carrier + 1 RX sector carrier
- 4 RX sector carrier + 2 RX sector carrier
- 4 RX sector carrier + 4 RX sector carrier

The following conditions need to be considered when configuring sector carriers for the

feature:

- In an Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group, all sector carriers must be configured in the same Baseband and must have the same frequency and the same bandwidth.
- A sector carrier can be included in only one Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group.
- A sector carrier already included in a combined cell is not allowed to be added in a Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group.

## 9.2 Parameter Configurations

Uplink Reception in HetNet

The timing of the uplink reception between a macro cell and small cell can differ in

a HetNet scenario. When the UE is closer to the small cell than the macro cell (for

example, handover point) there can be a difference in the downlink power level. The

SectorCarrier.ulForcedTimingAdvanceCommand attribute

increases the timing advance on the small cell (lower output power) so the uplink

signal is received from both reception points (macro + small) at the same time.

Figure 3   Cell Distances

- d = distance (in km) between the antennas of the small cell and the nearest macro cell of the same Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group
- When d ≤ 300 m, number of timing advances = SectorCarrier.ulForcedTimingAdvanceCommand = 0
- When d &gt; 300 m, SectorCarrier.ulForcedTimingAdvanceCommand = [6.4×dkm] where [.] means round to the nearest integer.

The SectorCarrier.pmCompUlToADiffDistr counter can be used to

identify the necessity of configuring

SectorCarrier.ulForcedTimingAdvanceCommand. If the majority

of small cells SectorCarrier.pmCompUlToADiffDistr samples are

&lt; −2µs or &gt; 2µs, then

SectorCarrier.ulForcedTimingAdvanceCommand needs to be set

accordingly.

Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group Disabled or Degraded

Table 5 shows the fault situations when the

Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point group becomes disabled or degraded:

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                                  |

Summary and Benefits

To rule out some Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception users, this feature

enhancement provides a new user selection functionality.

In high uplink traffic load environments, the following benefits might be observed

by tuning the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to a lower

value:

- Improved robustness
- Improved cell and UE throughput in the uplink
- Improved UL Scheduled Entities per TTI

Capacity and Performance

The performance of this feature enhancement can be observed with the following

counters monitoring the total UE scheduling activity in Uplink Coordinated

Multi-Point Reception:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp

Robustness is improved in high uplink traffic load cells.

This feature enhancement decreases the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCompUlDeltaSinrPuschDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCompUlDeltaSinrPuschDistr

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr
- EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr
- EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrHys
- EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrHys

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp

The recommended value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or

the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute is

400. In high uplink traffic load cells, the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute can be set to a

smaller value to rule out more users from Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.

A smaller value might have a negative impact on the following KPIs:

- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput
- UL HARQ BLER

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q3: Enhanced Load Management for Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

This feature enhancement improves the

robustness of the node in the network

after the

Uplink CoMP is enabled.

| Upgrade at Impact      | Mandatory                                  |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement reduces the PUSCH receiver processing load, and improves the

robustness

after

the Uplink CoMP is enabled

based

on the following processes:

- Identification of Uplink CoMP users and non-uplink CoMP users
- Definition of different PUSCH receiver processing load consumption for Uplink CoMP users and non-uplink CoMP users

This feature enhancement supports the mixed Uplink CoMP and non-uplink CoMP

users.

Capacity and Performance

With

this feature enhancement,

Uplink

Medium Access Control (MAC) throughput for each BBM might

increase,

when the following conditions are

both

met:

- There are both Uplink CoMP and non-Uplink CoMP users in high Uplink traffic load cases.
- Most of the users are non-Uplink CoMP users, and fewer users are Uplink CoMP users. The specific proportion of Uplink CoMP users is difficult to predict, since it is related to the distribution of users and the user traffic model in network.

In other cases,

the

Uplink throughput and PUSCH receiver processing load decreases,

while the robustness of the node increases.

Operation

The default values of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr

attribute and the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute

are changed from 150 to 400. As a result, more UEs

are selected as Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception users, Uplink throughput

might degrade in high Uplink load

scenario.

In high Uplink traffic load cases, it is recommended to set the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to a value

smaller

than 400 to improve

the

robustness. Decreasing the value of these attributes might

increase Uplink throughput, but the exact value depends on the site settings.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

For this feature enhancement, Uplink CoMP-capable hardware is needed.

This feature enhancement

is

applicable to

LTE

FDD and LTE TDD hardware. For more information, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive

IoT RAN.

Description of Correction

The uplink throughput of a single user that takes full buffer traffic service might

decrease, for example, a single user, which takes peak throughput test or

competition test. The greater the number of cells and background users, the more

obvious the degradation becomes.

To avoid single user uplink throughput decreasing in full buffer traffic service use

case, the recommendations are the following:

- For long-term solution, turn on the Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature.
- For short-term solution, set the value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to equal or smaller than 150.

Description of Correction

For most uplink CoMP users in very poor radio conditions, the uplink RLC BLER of the

node might increase with the Enhanced Load Management for Uplink Coordinated

Multi-Point Reception feature enhancement. The increase of uplink RLC BLER might

also be observed in other cases.
