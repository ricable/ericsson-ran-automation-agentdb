Summary

The Micro Sleep Tx feature decreases energy consumption of radio units in the node.

Energy is saved by switching off the power amplifiers on a symbol-time basis when no

user data needs to be transmitted on downlink.

Micro Sleep Tx enables Discontinuous Transmission on downlink to save energy during

low traffic. With Micro Sleep Tx, there is minimal power emission during OFDM

symbols that are not used for transmitting user data. The LTE downlink transmission

format, transmission of CRS, SSS, PSS, and PBCH, are kept intact.

Micro Sleep Tx automatically enables and disables the main power amplifier in the

radio. The power amplifier is turned off when no PDSCH traffic is scheduled on a

subframe, and during symbols that do not carry mandatory information.

Micro Sleep Tx is a non-license-controlled feature on LTE, and it is on by default.

This makes it possible for the power amplifiers to be ready for transmission when an

OFDM symbol is scheduled with data to be sent.

The Micro Sleep Tx feature is available for NB-IoT in-band and guard band deployments

as well.

The feature is enabled and disabled on sector carrier level in no combined cell

setup, but it is on by default at cell level per TX branch.

# 2 Dependencies of Micro Sleep Tx

The Micro Sleep Tx feature is related to features that influence the traffic and the

energy consumption of the radio units. This feature does not support several radio

units.

The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature can make more blank             subframes where no user data needs to be transmitted, so there are more opportunities             for when the power amplifier can be put into sleep mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Hardware

All Ericsson radio units released after March 2013 are supported, except the units

listed in the Limitations section.

Limitations

The Micro Sleep Tx feature works in mixed mode operation if multiple standards are

configured on the same radio with the following limitations:

- The feature works for each TX branch. Therefore, the feature is triggered on branches, even if other TX branches are configured with other standards: Branches configured for LTE only Branches configured in Mixed Mode with LTE This granularity applies for each band for most current multiband radios with two or more bands sharing one antenna connector (rfPort).
- The Micro Sleep Tx feature is triggered only in mixed mode configurations if all the standards support the feature. The combination of three or more standards is supported. A combination of the following standards is supported: ESS GSM LTE NB-IoT NR
- The feature only triggers power saving on TX branches if there is no transmission from any of the standards.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Micro Sleep Tx

The Micro Sleep Tx feature is active by default. It can be disabled and enabled on sector

carrier level in no combined cell setup, using the

SectorCarrier.microSleepTxEnabled attribute.

The actual power saving is performed in the radio unit by turning off the power amplifier

when there is no data to transmit. Functionality is blocked for radios and configurations that

are not supported.

Micro Sleep Tx automatically enables and disables the main power amplifier in the radio by

turning the gate bias on and off on a symbol duration time scale. The power amplifier is

turned off for each symbol if there is no data to transmit in downlink. For each symbol, the

baseband unit indicates to the radio if the power amplifier can be turned off.

To turn off power amplifiers, there must be no data to transmit by any carrier using the same

RF port if Single Mode Multiple Carriers configuration is used. If there is data to transmit

by at least one carrier, the power amplifiers of that RF port are in operation.

If an MBMS subframe is transmitted, the power amplifier always remains on.

In case of NB-IoT in-band and guard band deployments, the feature enables the configuration

of an NB-IoT guard band or in-band cell as 4T4R or 2T4R when the cell is attached to an LTE

sector carrier that is configured as 4T4R.In a 2T4R configuration for the NB-IoT cell, the

Micro Sleep Tx feature can trigger the power saving more often on two of the antenna ports.

This provides additional power saving for radios configured with LTE.

# 4 Network Impact

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

# 5 Parameters for Micro Sleep Tx

The feature is configured by parameters determining the capability and status of the

functionality and activating it on the carriers.

Table 3   Parameters

The microSleepTxRadioCapability attribute can have three

values:

| NO_SUPPORT      |    | Initial value used for the attribute until the capability is                             reported.                                                                                                                  |

| FULL_SUPPORT    |    | Used when the radio has full capability to support the feature, and when                             it is not possible to tell if the feature works on specified radio unit                             revisions. |
|                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| LIMITED_SUPPORT |    | Used when the radio has limited capability to support the feature. The                             radio cannot save power on every symbol position.                                                                |

The system evaluates whether the radios support the feature at the first carrier

setup after a successful self-test. The evaluation is independent of the activation

state of the feature.

Affected Parameters

The implementation of this feature affects no parameters.

# 6 Performance of Micro Sleep Tx

The operation of this feature can be observed through a PM counter.

Key

Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The SectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime PM counter shows the amount

of possible sleep time for the Micro Sleep Tx feature. The observed sleep time per

sector carrier can be different from the actual sleep time in the radio.

The following PM counters monitor the total time and ratio Tx branches are

switched off in radio units capable of reporting it, regardless of radio node

configurations and activated sleep features:

- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffTime
- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffRatio
- RfPort.pmTxOffTime
- RfPort.pmTxOffRatio
- FreqBandData.pmTxOffTime
- FreqBandData.pmTxOffRatio
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime1
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime2
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime3
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime4
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio1
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio2
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio3
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio4

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Benefits

and Summary

The enhancement removes the license for Micro Sleep

Tx

and makes it a basic feature for LTE. The feature is turned on by default.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The

SectorCarrier.microSleepTxEnabled

attribute is added, which is used to enable and disable the Micro Sleep

Tx

feature on sector carrier

level in no

combined cell setup.

NB-IoT Access in standalone deployment conflicts with

Micro Sleep Tx, they cannot both be activated simultaneously. Set the

SectorCarrier.microSleepTxEnabled attribute to

false in the following configurations:

- If standalone NB-IoT cell is configured on the same RfPort as LTE sector carrier.
- In a multiband radio, if multiple frequency bands share the same RfPort and the frequency bands have separate power amplifiers, only the LTE sector carrier on the same frequency band as the standalone Nb-Iot cell is affected.
- If the LTE sector carrier is configured as ESS, the same limitations apply when used together with a standalone NB-IoT cell.

NB-IoT guard band and in-band deployments can work together with Micro Sleep

Tx, but decrease its gain for energy saving.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.e: 22.Q2: NB-IoT Antenna Muting for Guard Band and In-Band

The power saving capabilities of the Micro Sleep Tx feature are increased for NB-IoT

guard band and in-band

deployment.

| Feature Name:           | System Enhancement in MI22.Q2   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | 18/FAJ 121 4970                 |
| Value Package Name:     | M-IoT RAN on LTE Base Package   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1000                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | MI                              |

Summary and Benefits

This system enhancement improves the performance of the Micro Sleep Tx feature for

NB-IoT guard band and in-band deployment. It enables the configuration of an NB-IoT

guard band or in-band cell as 4T4R or 2T4R when the cell is attached to an LTE

sector carrier that is configured as 4T4R.

In a 2T4R configuration for the NB-IoT cell, the Micro Sleep Tx feature can trigger

the power saving more often on two of the antenna ports. This provides additional

power saving for radios configured with LTE.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- The NB-IoT system can send data on 2T while the LTE data is kept sending on 4T.
- More power is saved on 2T without interrupting the NB-IoT data transmission by switching off power amplifiers more frequently when the LTE cell has low traffic.

Capacity and Performance

Setting the SectorCarrier.microSleepTxEnabled attribute to

false disables the Micro Sleep Tx feature. In this case, to

prevent coverage loss, the default value, ALL\_ANTENNAS\_ON is

recommended for the NbIotCell.microSleepTxPattern attribute.

Operation

The system enhancement affects the

SectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime counter in the following

way:

- For 2T4R configuration, the SectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime counter is calculated based on the sector carrier level.
- For 4T4R configuration, the SectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime counter is calculated based on all the carrier branches. This is different from the earlier implementation that is only dependent on the first carrier branch.

The NbIotCell.microSleepTxPattern attribute is introduced with

this enhancement with the following values:

- ALL\_ANTENNAS\_ON is the default value. The narrowband data is sent on four antennas.

- The value MAX\_TWO\_ANTENNAS\_ON is set when the narrowband data is sent on two antennas. In this case, power saving is expected although it results in coverage loss. This coverage loss can be marginal for interference-limited channels.

For examples on the configuration of the RfBranch MO, see the

following examples in Manage Hardware Equipment:

- Numbering of the RfBranch MO Instances Aligned with the RfPort and AuPort MO Instances for ABB4\_1A
- Ordering of RfBranch MO References Compliant with ABB4\_1A for a SectorEquipmentFunction MO

Interfaces
