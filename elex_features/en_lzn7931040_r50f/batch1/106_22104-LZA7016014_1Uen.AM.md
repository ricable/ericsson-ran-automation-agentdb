# 1 Robust Header Compression Overview

The Robust Header Compression feature increases capacity and coverage by compressing

packet headers.

Summary

The Robust Header Compression feature is a framework specified by the IETF to compress IP

packet headers. The feature is used in LTE to compress headers of primarily radio

bearers carrying VoIP calls (VoLTE or PTT) to increase capacity and coverage. Before

the Robust Header Compression feature is used, a channel between the two ROHC

end-points must be established.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Decreases the size of a VoIP packet and thereby decreases the capacity needed for a VoIP call. This improves the over-the-air capacity for best effort users which share bandwidth with VoIP users in the cell.
- Increases the cell coverage when segmentation occurs during H-ARQ retransmissions.

# 2 Dependencies of Robust Header Compression

The feature applies to PTT as well when Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk is

used.
