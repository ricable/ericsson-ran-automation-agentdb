# 3 Included Functions

## 3.1 Automated Mobility Optimization Overview

The Automated Mobility Optimization feature provides an RBS with the capacity to

automatically

calibrate

mobility parameters. It

allows

the operator to observe the occurrence of related problems.

| Feature Name           | Automated Mobility Optimization                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 3035                                            |
| Value Package Name     | Self-Organizing Networks                                |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0435                                            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                     |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license for each radio. |

Summary

The default mobility parameters in the RBS are not always optimized when an operator

deploys the network. An RBS with poor mobility parameters

might

encounter the following problems:

- Too early handover
- Too late handover
- Handover to wrong cell
- Ping-pong handover

The Automated Mobility Optimization feature reduces the number of radio connection

failures and unnecessary handovers,

which

increases

RBS throughput,

increases

RBS throughput and the quality of VoIP and streaming

services.

Depending on the network structure and customer needs, it is possible to selectively

deactivate

andactivate

the feature on three levels:

- Frequency-relation level
- Cell-relation level
- External vendor level

## 3.3 Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation Overview

The Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation feature removes the need for manually

allocating a spread of EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence and

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence

attributes. This reduces the overlap of root sequences.

| Feature Name           | Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 2026                                           |
| Value Package Name     | Self-Organizing Networks                               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0435                                           |

## 3.4 Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility Overview

The Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility feature improves the functionality of the

Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature by optimizing the search for alternative

frequencies through the use of collected data and

machine

intelligence.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license required for each node. |

Summary

The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature uses a search zone along the edge of the cell,

where UE measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells.

With

the Machine Intelligence Enabled

Mobility

feature, this search is limited to frequencies that a UE is

likely to accept as target for handover. This is achieved by predicting the

frequency coverage based on a model for the coverage of frequencies. The model is

built on data collected through UE measurements.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Faster inter-frequency handover
- On average, UEs spend less time in poor coverage
- Improved selection of target frequency for inter-frequency handover
- Possibility to reuse the same configuration for each defined EUtranFreqRelations MO
- Connected mode mobility priority over the entire network
- Combines configured priority with predicted coverage

## 3.5 Overlaid Cell Detection Overview

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature

optimizes

the detection of small cells for load balancing in the eNodeB

for

offload. The feature also improves offload by using automatic and dynamic

identification.

| Feature Name           | Overlaid Cell Detection                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 3078                                            |
| Value Package Name     | Self-Organizing Networks                                |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0435                                            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                     |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license for each radio. |

Summary

The

identification

of small cells for load balancing or offload is done based on hit rates.

Cells with different sizes are expected to be deployed in heterogeneous networks.When load

balancing and offload is used, the Overlaid Cell Detection feature improves the

efficiency of small cells with high capacity. Small cells are expected to be seen

with low hit rate from the surrounding large cells. If small cells

have

a lower hit rate than the specified threshold in the Best

Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature, they cannot be

automatically added as load relations.

Additional Information

- Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management
- Coverage-Adapted Load Management

## 3.6 PCI Conflict Reporting Overview

The PCI Conflict Reporting feature detects PCI conflicts and reports them to the

ENM.

| Feature Name           | PCI Conflict Reporting                                              |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                 |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                 |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each radio. |

Summary

This feature improves handover and UE drop statistics through the reporting of PCI conflicts

to the ENM. This allows for the fast resolution of PCI conflicts.

UEs cannot distinguish between two cells if the cells have the same PCI and the same

frequency. It is possible that a handover fails if the PCI that is included in the

measurement report does not uniquely identify the cell. The PCI Conflict Reporting

feature detects PCI confusion, which happens when PCIs do not uniquely identify the

neighbor cells. As a result, a faulty configuration can be detected

automatically.

PCI confusion might occur even when no configured relations exist.

PCI collision is when a UE is in one cell and can detect another cell with the same PCI and

frequency. If the UE needs to perform a handover to a cell with the same PCI as the

source cell, the UE moves towards the cell with the same PCI and frequency. In most

of these cases, the UE drops, because it cannot distinguish the target cell from the

source cell. PCI collision can be detected by the PCI Conflict Reporting feature

only if relations are manually configured. However, it is possible that a PCI

collision also results in a PCI confusion for another cell. PCI collisions are

detected indirectly by this feature. This improves statistics regarding UE drops

caused by PCI collisions.

## 3.7 UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization Overview

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature enables the UE to perform a

handover to the best cell earlier.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license for each radio. |

Summary

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature decreases the number of

unnecessary handovers in a radio network.

This

has the benefit of reduced signal load and increased

throughput

In a radio network where the HOM is configured to a high value, the UE Level

Oscillating Handover Minimization feature makes it possible to decrease the

configured HOM.

This

does not increase the number of handovers and has the benefit of allowing UEs to

perform a handover to the best cell earlier.
