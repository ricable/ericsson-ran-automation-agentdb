# 1 Introduction

The Network Impact Report (NIR) describes the new and enhanced features and how they affect

the overall network.

The content of this document is subject to change. New features and additional details are

added as more details are available from development and verification activities until the

features are released for commercial use.

How to Read the Network Impact Report

The purpose of the NIR is to provide information to support the introduction of new

features and upgrades to the network.

The NIR is split into the following sections:

| Released Functions               |    | Globally released and unrestricted changes to the network performance                                 and operation.                              |
|----------------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                   |
| Temporarily Restricted Functions |    | Restricted changes to the network performance and operation that are                                 planned to be released in upcoming releases. |

Each section is further divided into the following subsections, where every change

has its own separate description:

| New Features                |    | Newly introduced features that require activation and might also require                             a new license. The description of the feature includes the impact on                             capacity, counters, KPIs, alarms, parameters, and other operational                             aspects. For more information about a specific feature, refer to the                             corresponding Feature Description documents.   |

# 2 Released Functions

## 2.1 New Features

Overview information about the globally released and unrestricted new features.

For more information about the features, see the feature description documents.

### 2.1.1 23.Q1: NR and LTE OAM and Node Security for COM User Roles

The feature introduces new COM user roles for NR and LTE, which support more detailed

authorization. As a result, the execution of common tasks no longer requires unnecessarily

high privileges.

Summary and Benefits

The feature allows the allocation of tailored roles to user accounts for common

tasks, instead of using the high privileged Maintenance User account. The two new

pre-defined COM User Roles allow field technicians to do common tasks without having

full access to the entire MOM. Currently such tasks either require an administrator

role or a Maintenance User account, therefore the introduced roles will serve as a

solution to this issue.

The following characteristics apply to the roles:

- Users with the Diagnostic\_Application\_Troubleshooter role will be capable to execute health-checks, which is otherwise limited to read-only operations.
- Users with the Advanced\_Application\_Troubleshooter role will be capable to lock or unlock cells and perform an NE restart.

Assigning both roles to user profiles creates a combination of the two roles that

will provide sufficient privileges for advanced field technicians to perform a

complete set of operations.

The OAM and Node Security feature is introduced to NR and LTE base packages to

prevent security enhancements from being handled as system improvements.

Summary and Benefits

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Drastically reduce cost for deploying new sites.
- Operators can check if the transport network supports the required bandwidth before a new RBS is put into service.

This feature performs a throughput measurement between the RBS and an iPerf3 server

to provide information about the throughput to the RBS and from the RBS.

Capacity and Performance

If this feature is used on the RBS that is taken into service, the traffic might be

disrupted until the throughput transport network measurement is completed

successfully. To avoid network impact, it is recommended to use this feature before

the RBS is taken into service.

This feature supports up to four sessions simultaneously. The total possible

throughput is up to 3 Gbps.

Operation

The throughput measurement is triggered by running the ranperf

Ericsson CLI command.

With this feature, the process of an RBS installation has the following steps:

1. Installing the upgrade package
2. Locking cells to prohibit traffic
3. Measuring throughput from the RBS
4. Measuring throughput to the RBS
5. Unlocking cells to enable traffic.

The measurement result is printed directly in the shell. If the result shows that

there is not sufficient bandwidth, troubleshooting of the transport network is

needed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature is supported on the units in RAN Compute Group 4 and RAN Compute Group

5.

For more information on RAN Compute Groups, see DU and Baseband Configuration and Capacity.

Other Network Elements

This feature requires a standalone iPerf3 server or an iPerf3 server hosted by a

network element.

The performance of the network is measured between the RBS and another network

location chosen by the operator. Because of this, the iPerf3 server must be located

at that network location.

| Licensing:              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                 node. |

Summary and Benefits

During mobile network operation, different kinds of security threats can arise, such

as connecting to false base stations. This feature introduces a mechanism to detect

false base stations. It collects and prepares data for security checks without the

use of additional hardware components.

Data is collected from the UE according to 3GPP specifications. The following

measurement types are supported:

- Inter-frequency and intra-frequency E-UTRAN
- UTRAN
- GERAN

Security-Initiated PM events are generated based on received measurements reports.

These events are stored in the eNodeB and are transferred to ENM in the following

ways:

- In the Cell Trace
- In the UE Trace
- In the Cell Trace and the UE Trace

The collected data is analyzed in the ESM and compared with the legal network

topology stored in ENM to detect attacks on the network.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Attacks on network resources are prevented. This improves network security for the operator.
- Data interception and phishing is prevented. This improves network security for the subscriber.

Capacity and Performance

The feature affects network load in the following ways:

- The feature generates RRC signaling between the eNodeB and the UE, which increases the load on the Uu interface. The load is increased when UE measurements are started and stopped, and when the UE sends measurement reports to the eNodeB.
- Each incoming measurement report from the UE generates a PM event, which increases the load on the eNodeB.
- The increased number of PM events increases the load on the transport network when the events are transmitted to ENM.

The feature must be configured and used in a way that minimizes the following effects

on performance:

| Throughput and latency   |    | The increased uplink RRC signaling can decrease throughput and                                 increase latency. This is because RRC signaling has scheduling                                 priority over user data. Measurement gaps can also decrease                                 throughput and increase latency.   |

| Retainability            |    | An increased number of dropped calls can be expected when this                                 feature is used. The added signaling can affect retainability.                                                                                                                                                                |

| Mobility                 |    | If the UE is configured to transmit large measurement reports with                                 high frequency, RRC signaling increases significantly. This can                                 affect UE measurements used for mobility and mobility                                 performance.                        |
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| UE battery performance   |    | Each UE measurement requires processing power in the UE. Therefore,                                 each UE measurement reduces the battery performance of the UE.                                                                                                                                                           |

A maximum of two extra UE measurements triggered by Performance Management are

allowed for each cell at the same time. The purpose of this limit is to minimize the

impact of UE measurements on performance and capacity. A non-configurable priority

list is used to define the priorities of the UE measurements. In this priority list,

measurements performed by the LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature have

higher priority than the measurements performed by the PM-Initiated UE Measurements

feature. If the LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature is active, it is

possible that PM-initiated UE measurements are not selected. This is because of the

way the priority list is defined.

The feature affects several KPIs. The impact on the KPIs is described in Table 2.

Summary and Benefits

This feature detects and logs port scanning attacks over transport layer protocols on

ports where no incoming traffic is expected.

The feature filters and analyzes incoming traffic to detect ongoing port scanning

attacks. The detection of a suspected port scanning attack generates an entry in the

security log.

Security log entries of port scanning attacks include the following details:

- Date and time of the attack
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Destination ports

This feature has the benefit of increased auditability because of the logging of port

scanning attacks.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature tracks connection states in both ingress and egress traffic. As a result,

when the MAC address of a fragmented packet is resolved, the value of the following

PM counters increases by double the expected value:

- PeerIPsecTunnel.ipIfStatsOutFragCreates
- InterfaceIpv4.ipIfStatsOutFragCreates
- InterfaceIpv6.ipIfStatsOutFragCreates

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

In a routed network, if the packet fragments of a reassembled egress packet are

larger than the MTU of the interface, the Packet Too

Big ICMPv6 error message is sent for the reassembled egress

packet, not each individual packet fragment.

### 2.1.7 23.Q2: LTE Modulation-Aware Power Control

This feature provides a baseband power

backoff functionality to improve Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for non-AAS-capable radios,

excluding the Dot and high-band radios, at full power.

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature provides a baseband power backoff functionality.

This feature brings higher throughput due to improved EVM at full power.

This feature has the following limitations:

- Baseband power backoff is not supported for users with lower SINR.
- If the PRB load is low and high SINR users who satisfy the power backoff conditions are scheduled, the downlink throughput might be degraded due to over-backoff.
- Only CPRI interface is supported.
- ESS is not supported.

Capacity and Performance

This feature brings throughput improvement. The scheduler can order less than the

default full output power per PRB for users when the resulting lower output power

and better EVM together provide improved performance.

The observability can be monitored with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrb
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrb
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbQci

The performance can be observed through downlink throughput and BLER variation

compared with legacy, which could be observed through the following KPIs:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput - fixed time normalized
- Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput considering traffic
- Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PDSCH slot only
- Average DL MAC DRB Throughput
- DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS
- Mean Downlink Throughput

Operation

This feature is OFF by default. This feature introduces the attribute

SectorCarrier.evmPowerBackoffAllowed and can be enabled by

setting it to ON.

For cases of radio mixed mode on the same PA, the backoff value might be insufficient

for radio and excessive for some users due to absence of coordination between

schedulers. Therefore, it is recommended to keep this feature enhancement off if the

traffic load is always low even if the full transmitted power is used. Operators can

turn it on with the MOM attribute when the traffic load of all carriers is high.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

Radio Gateway and LC-05 9xCPRI in Conversion mode are not supported.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 23.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

Summary and Benefits

The LTE Random Access Range Restriction feature introduces MO attributes to allow the

configuration of random access range. With the new attributes, random access range

can be configured more accurately.

This feature has the following benefits:

- The configuration of the random access procedure is improved.
- The benefits of this feature are most prominent if the random access range is configured to be much smaller than the cell range.

Capacity and Performance

If the random access range is configured to be much smaller than the cell range, the

probability of accepting UEs within the cell range but outside of the random access

range is reduced. In setups with large cell ranges, this configuration improves the

accuracy of UEs accepted in the cell.

If the random access range is configured to be smaller than the cell range, UEs in

the area within the cell range but outside of the configured random access range are

unable to request initial access to the cell. If there are many UEs in this area,

the Random Access MSG1 Success Rate KPI decreases.

Operation

To enable this feature, the EUtranCellFDD.raRange attribute or the

EUtranCellTDD.raRange attribute must be set to a value larger

than 0. If the value of these attributes is 0,

this feature is disabled. If the feature is disabled, these attributes are ignored

by the cell, and the random access range is defined instead by the cell range.

Summary and Benefits

This feature introduces a procedure to perform inter-frequency handover when the UE

is in connected mode if the following conditions apply:

- A frequency with higher priority is available.
- Coverage is good.

The operator can turn on the feature in specific cells and specify higher priority

frequencies as inter-frequency handover targets for the UE.

This feature has the following benefits:

- The UE can be handed over to a cell with better coverage, even if the coverage is good in the original cell.
- Uplink throughput is improved.
- Network capacity is improved.

The following UEs are not targeted by the LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher

Priority feature:

- UEs using QCI1 bearers
- UEs with active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk sessions
- UEs with Category M type
- UEs with ongoing emergency calls

Capacity and Performance

By enabling inter-frequency handovers, the number of handovers increases, both in

general and within the LTE cell.

This feature might

increment the following PM

counters

that track inter-frequency handover performance:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexCellHoExeAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexCellHoExeSuccLteInterF
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexCellHoPrepAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexCellHoPrepSuccLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSuccLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSuccLteInterF
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexCellHoExeAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexCellHoExeSuccLteInterF
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexCellHoPrepAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexCellHoPrepSuccLteInterF

The feature might have a negative impact on retainability KPIs, because an increased

number of handovers might lead to more call drops.

The increased number of handovers might also affect the following KPIs:

- Mobility Success Rate
- Cell Mobility Success Rate
- Handover Success Rate
- Cell Handover Success Rate
- Handover Execution Success Rate
- Cell Handover Execution Success Rate

Operation

The feature introduces the following attributes on the

EUtranCellTDD andEUtranCellFDD MO

- EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEnabled

The feature introduces the following attributes on the

UeMeasControl MO class:

- UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT
- UeMeasControl.waitStartInterFHoHigherPrio

Prioritized frequencies of the feature are set through the

EUtranFreqRelation.ifHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute. Feature

operation can be further configured by changing the

UeMeasControl.waitStartInterFHoHigherPrio and

UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timers.

The feature introduces the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio MO

class and its following attributes for the A5 measurement configuration:

Summary and Benefits

This feature enables capability dissuade node theft by preventing its enrollment into

new networks.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Reduce the rate of theft of Baseband units
- Save operator from losing money and network coverage

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature introduces the TheftDeterrence MO class and the

following attributes:

- TheftDeterrence.thdAuthentication
- TheftDeterrence.thdStatus
- TheftDeterrence.thdStoredId

The following actions are used for locking or unlocking a node:

- TheftDeterrence.lock
- TheftDeterrence.unlock

The protection mechanism works partially by disallowing to configure PLMN IDs when

this feature is activated, in order to prevent malicious manipulation of the PLMN ID

configuration from illegitimate owners.

If the Baseband node detects a misconfiguration of PLMN IDs when this feature is

active, the node enters a misconfiguration state, and the Theft

Deterrence Board Restore Pending alarm is raised. This alarm

causes the node to revert to initial software mode after the grace period has

elapsed.

Summary and Benefits

The Radio Gateway feature parity with non-AAS-capable CPRI radio units in ESS

configurations has the following benefits:

- Improved flexibility for allocating carriers to RF ports with Radio Gateway.
- Reduced power consumption due to the possibility of not using all RF ports on radios in Radio Gateway and ESS configurations.

This system improvement supports NR explicit in Radio Gateway configurations and can

be combined with LTE maximal or LTE explicit in ESS configurations.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This system improvement enables the setup of Radio Gateway, so ESS configurations no

longer fail due to mismatching antenna values. If the value of the

noOfTxAntennas or noOfRxAntennas

attribute under the SectorCarrier or

NRSectorCarrier MO does not match between RANs in ESS

configurations, the lowest value is used for setup, and the RAN with highest value

becomes degraded. The ESS Inconsistent Configuration

alarm is raised.

If the ConfigurationOrCustomizationError text is

displayed, it corresponds to the ESS Inconsistent

Configuration alarm with the additional text Value

of parameter noOfRxAntennas or noOfTxAntennas is inconsistent with value already

configured by ESS partner.

Summary and Benefits

The

PmEventService.ueTrExcludeNonRacUeRefEvents

attribute

is

set to true. Because of

this,

it filters out PM events from the UE trace file that do not contain a

valid

UE identifier. This change includes cell and

RBS-type

events.

The benefit of this change is to

deny

the UE trace file to exceed the allocated 1 MB storage. Without this change, the UE

trace collects UE type PM events associated with more than just the UE to be traced,

making the trace file exceed the allocated 1 MB storage.

Summary and Benefits

Continuous evolution of the RAN software portfolio has a natural side effect that the

software size becomes bigger with each release. Sometimes, it leads to a shortage of

an internal RAN Compute unit storage. From 23.Q1 radio software is no longer stored

on the RAN Compute unit disk, resulting in a significant increase of the amount of

available disk space. It will benefit upgrades with 23.Q1 as a from-state, and all

future upgrades. Please observe that Baseband R503 software and Radio Gateway

software are in this context treated as radio software.

Before 23.Q1, the radio software was permanently stored on the RAN Compute unit disk,

while from 23.Q1 onwards, the radio software is deleted after the radio units have

been successfully loaded and started. The radio software is also deleted from older

Upgrade Packages (UPs), that are stored on the RAN Compute unit disk. If a radio

software is needed again, it is automatically redownloaded from SMRS. Downloading a

radio software from SMRS can take from a few seconds up to a few minutes, depending

on dimensioning of the O&amp;M link.

Radio units have own persistent storage for software, where they store the software

currently running, and a previous one. Therefore, it is only in rare cases that a

radio requires software from a RAN Compute unit again. Examples of such cases are: a

radio unit replacement, or a rollback to a second older UP.

Although this is not a new requirement, it is important to remember that all RAN

Compute units must have access to an SMRS server where UPs are located. It is also

important to make sure that the SMRS server stores all the UPs that are used by the

RAN Compute units in the network, either currently or as a backup.

ENM 21.4 introduced a feature for locking UPs at SMRS to prevent accidental removal,

that can be of additional help. In case a radio software is needed, but the related

UP is not be found on SMRS, the alarm Software Management Lost

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following changes:

- The E-RAN traffic latency is measured automatically.
- The latency threshold for E-RAN traffic is set automatically.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The maximum throughput between two carrier aggregating Elastic RAN nodes can increase in the downlink.
- The manual workload of operators is decreased.

Capacity and Performance

The maximum throughput between two carrier aggregating Elastic RAN nodes can increase

in the downlink, if E-RAN tunnel link latency is 20-160 µs. This change can be

observed in the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran

E-RAN tunnel link latency can be observed with the following read-only attributes:

- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency1minAvg

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                      |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement updates the X2 TNL Address Discovery procedure. The update

allows the Automatic Neighbor Relations feature on the eNodeB to create consistent

neighbor configuration for NR cells with MORAN configuration hosted by a shared

gNodeB.

The feature enhancement introduces the following functions:

- An IP request can be sent from the MME to the gNodeB through a proxy Master Node for the hosted neighbor NR cell with MORAN configuration. The proxy Master Node can select the gNodeB based on the global gNodeB ID received from the NCGI measurement report of the cell with MORAN configuration sent from the UE.
- The Automated Neighbor Relations feature can correct the inconsistent neighbor configuration of an external neighbor gNodeB with MORAN configuration.
- Automatic EN-DC X2 setup to the neighbor gNodeB with MORAN configuration.
- Selecting the correct IP address for EN-DC X2 setup between the eNodeB and the neighbor gNodeB with MORAN configuration when multiple IP addresses are configured for the operators.

The Master Node is acting as proxy in the X2 TNL Address Discovery procedure by

providing the following functions:

- Sending information to the MME about the connected Secondary Nodes
- Forwarding IP address requests from the MME to the selected Secondary Node

The eNodeB provides separate instance for a connected gNodeB hosting cells with

MORAN configuration, if the

ENodeBFunction.separateEngNBForMoranEnalbed is set to

true. As a result, the gNodeB has separate instances for MORAN

and non-MORAN configured cells in the list of connected gNodeBs

IE. The MME can identify the gNodeB from the global gNodeB ID received from an NCGI

measurement report for a cell with MORAN configuration.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The number of successful EN-DC setups to a gNodeB with MORAN configuration increases.
- The need for manual configuration of LTE-to-NR cell relations is decreased.
- New NR cells with MORAN configuration can be introduced without specific neighbor cell relation planning.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement increases the load on the main processor, because of the

increased modification of the NR neighbor object and the increased signaling on the

S1 interface.

Outgoing NR IRAT handovers are interrupted until the inconsistent NR neighbor objects

are removed and the correct NR neighbor object is created.

Increase in the

throughput

KPIs can be observed with the following PM

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrb

- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrb

The

correction of the incorrect configuration can be monitored with

the following PM

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmAnrNeighbrelAdd
- EUtranCellFDD.pmAnrNeighbrelRem
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAnrNeighbrelAdd
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAnrNeighbrelRem

Operation

To allow the Automatic Neighbor Relations feature to create consistent cell relations

to NR cells hosted by a gNodeB with MORAN configuration, the following attributes

must be configured:

- The AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute must be set to ACTIVATED.
- The ENodeBFunction.endcX2IpAddrViaS1Active attribute must be set to true.
- The GUtranFreqRelation.anrMeasOn attribute must be set to true.

If the MME identifies the target gNodeB by a combination of any PLMN from the

Broadcast PLMNs and the gNodeB ID from the list of connected

gNodeBs IE, the

ENodeBFunction.separateEnGNbForMoranEnabled attribute must be

set to false.

If the MME identifies a separate instance for the MORAN configuration of the target

gNodeB by a combination of the first PLMN from the Broadcast PLMNs and the gNodeB ID

from the list of connected gNodeBs IE, the

ENodeBFunction.separateEnGNbForMoranEnabled attribute must be

set to true.

The correction of the

incorrect

configuration can be monitored with the following PM events:

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NEIGHBREL\_REMOVE with the EVENT\_VALUE\_CORRECT\_FAULTY event parameter in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_CAUSE.
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NEIGHBREL\_ADD

The relocation of the ExternalGUtranCell MO class under the

correct parent MO can be monitored with the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NEIGHBCELL\_CHANGE PM event with the

following event parameters:

- EVENT\_VALUE\_CORRECT\_FAULTY in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_CAUSE
- EVENT\_VALUE\_REMOVE or EVENT\_VALUE\_ADD in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_OPERATION

The removal of an incorrect ExteranlGNodeBFunction MO can be

monitored with the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NEIGHBGNB\_CHANGE  PM event

with the following event parameters:

- EVENT\_VALUE\_CORRECT\_FAULTY in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_CAUSE
- EVENT\_VALUE\_REMOVE in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_OPERATION

The creation of the correct ExteranlGNodeBFunction MO can be

monitored with the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NEIGHBGNB\_CHANGE PM event

with the following event parameters:

- EVENT\_VALUE\_CORRECT\_FAULTY in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_CAUSE
- EVENT\_VALUE\_ADD in the EVENT\_PARAM\_ANR\_OPERATION

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the following

interfaces:

- S1 The signaling and message size is increased on the S1 interfaces when the ENodeBFunction.separateEnGnbForMoranEnabled attribute is set to true. The following messages are used to send the Connected en-gNB List IE to the MME to update the list of connected gNodeBs IE: S1AP S1 SETUP REQUEST S1AP ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE The following IEs are updated to indicate the PLMN for the selected IP network: Selected TAI on Source eNB ID in EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer Selected TAI on Source en-gNB ID in EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer The following messages are used to send the updated EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer IE: S1AP eNB CONFIGURATION TRANSFER S1AP MME CONFIGURATION TRANSFER

Summary and Benefits

This

system

enhancement improves UE attachment and cell throughput in NB-IoT

cells by increasing scheduling opportunities for CE level 0 and 1

UEs.

Capacity and Performance

This

system

enhancement improves uplink and downlink resource usage ratios

for CE level 0 and 1 UEs. The cell throughput increase can be observed using the

following PM counters:

- NbIotCell.pmRadioThpVolDlCe
- NbIotCell.pmRadioThpVolUlCe

High uplink or downlink load in the cell also affects the average UE throughput. The

following PM counters can be used to calculate the KPI for average throughput:

- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnTimeCe0Distr
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnTimeCe1Distr
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnTimeCe2Distr
- NbIotCell.pmUeSessionVolDlCe0Distr
- NbIotCell.pmUeSessionVolDlCe1Distr
- NbIotCell.pmUeSessionVolDlCe2Distr
- NbIotCell.pmUeSessionVolUlCe0Distr
- NbIotCell.pmUeSessionVolUlCe1Distr
- NbIotCell.pmUeSessionVolUlCe2Distr

The increased scheduling opportunities result in an increased number of CE level 0

and 1 UE attachments in the cell. The following PM counters can be used to observe

the UE attachment status in the cell:

- NbIotCell.pmRaAttNbCbra
- NbIotCell.pmRaMsg2AttNbCbra
- NbIotCell.pmRaSuccNbCbra
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnCe0Sum
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnCe0Max
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnCe1Sum
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnCe1Max

In case of high uplink or downlink load, the number of abnormal UE releases can

increase as well, because of the lack of available resources and the increase in

uplink and downlink interference. The following PM counters can be used to observe

the status of interference and abnormal releases:

- NbIotCell.pmRadioRecInterferencePwr
- NbIotCell.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrlCe
- NbIotCell.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbUeLostCe

The decrease of average uplink UE throughput can result in an increase of delays in

uplink transmission, and a higher probability of UE-triggered random access success

rate. The NbIotCell.pmRaSuccSrCe PM

counter

can be used to observe the random access success rate.

### 2.2.49 23.Q2: Elastic RAN Latency Autoconfiguration

This feature enhancement supports automatic latency measurements and

configuration.

| Feature Name           | Elastic RAN         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name     | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following changes:

- The E-RAN traffic latency is measured automatically.
- The latency threshold for E-RAN traffic is set automatically.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The maximum throughput between two carrier aggregating Elastic RAN nodes can increase in the downlink.
- The manual workload of operators is decreased.

Capacity and Performance

The maximum throughput between two carrier aggregating Elastic RAN nodes can increase

in the downlink, if E-RAN tunnel link latency is 20-160 µs. This change can be

observed in the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran

E-RAN tunnel link latency can be observed with the following read-only attributes:

- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency1minAvg
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency15minHWM
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency24hrsHWM

CPRI link one-way delay can be observed with the following PM counters:

- RiLink.pmLinkDelayHigh
- RiLink.pmLinkDelayLow

Operation

With this feature enhancement, the operator does not need to set the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRTTDelay attribute, as the

value of this attribute is not used by the eNodeB. Instead, the maximum allowed

delay for the E5 link depends on the RAN compute unit:

- The maximum allowed RTT is 60 µs for the following RAN Compute units: Capacity module B for RAN Compute Group 3 and 4 in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module C in LTE Radio CPRI mode
- The maximum allowed RTT is 160 µs for the following RAN Compute units: Capacity module A in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module B for RAN Compute Group 5 in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module A in LTE FDD AAS CPRI mode

With this feature enhancement, the

ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlRecDistr and the

ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlTransDistr PM counters also do

not take effect.

This feature enhancement introduces the Elastic RAN tunnel link latency

exceeds maximum allowed value. alarm text to the Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable

alarm.

The Inconsistent Configuration alarm is also updated to be

raised with the Elastic RAN cannot be activated towards remote eNodeB.

Values of eranLinkMaxRttDelay do not match. alarm text, if this

feature enhancement is not used for at least one pair of eNodeBs.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory              | Mandatory                       |

Summary and Benefits

More PM Events may be collected per ROP, limited by the size of the RAM disk rather

than the maximum file size.

The three cell trace files: CCTR, High Priority and Normal Priority are now

configurable independently in terms of their maximum size. The Normal priority file

size maximum is increased from 30MB to 100MB.

RAM disk size for low capacity hardware is scaled in line with node capacity, thereby

enabling more memory for traffic related functionality. Common usage of disk monitor

functionality is introduced.

Assignment of a file size does not guarantee the space is available and the overall

storage space is still constrained by the size of the RAM disk.

Capacity and Performance

The larger Normal Priority maximum file size means more PM Events may be collected by

ENM per ROP. ENM capacity and network bandwidth limit the number of nodes in the

network that can use this functionality.

Operation

New attributes are introduced for configuration of the maximum file size per file

type per event producer. For each file type the operator configures the

fileSizePercent as a percentage of the

fileSizeMax provided by the system.

LTE Configuration Management Impacts.

- The following attributes applicable to RAN Compute Groups 1 &amp; 3a, with LRAT are no longer used due to the new approach of managing the overall disk space and are obsolete without replacement: PmEventService: cellTraceHighPrioReserve PmEventService: totalCellTraceStorageSize PmEventService: totalUeTraceStorageSize PmEventService: totalEventStorageSize PmEventService: cellTraceFileSize applicable for all baseband hardware used by LRAT is now obsolete without deprecation. Instead of a single attribute to control the maximum file size for the CCTR, High Priority and Normal Priority files the file sizes are configured independently using attributes under PmEventM:EventProducer=Lrat:FileTypes=1:FileType. The existing setting is not preserved at upgrade. Instead, the default setting is set to be the maximum file size that was supported by the old attribute (30MB for a 270 MB RAM disk), minimizing customer impact at upgrade. Overall file storage is still protected by the disk monitor.

NR Configuration Management Impacts:

- CCTR, Normal Priority and High Priority file size maximums are no longer hardcoded at 30MB and they are now configurable to 30MB, 100MB and 30MB respectively (for a 270 MB RAM disk). The default value is 30MB.

Interfaces

This feature does not impact signaling interfaces.

Hardware

There are no hardware limitations on supported Baseband units.

Other Network Elements

The OAM interface and its overall bandwidth requirements are impacted. Larger files

mean that ENM needs to collect, process and store more data per ROP. The feature is

planned for delivery without any dependency on ENM. Increasing the file size has an

impact on ENM collection, mediation and storage of PM events, it is recommended to

have Overload Protection Mechanism for PMIC File System in place.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                                  |

Summary and Benefits

To rule out some Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception users, this feature

enhancement provides a new user selection functionality.

In high uplink traffic load environments, the following benefits might be observed

by tuning the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to a lower

value:

- Improved robustness
- Improved cell and UE throughput in the uplink
- Improved UL Scheduled Entities per TTI

Capacity and Performance

The performance of this feature enhancement can be observed with the following

counters monitoring the total UE scheduling activity in Uplink Coordinated

Multi-Point Reception:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp

Robustness is improved in high uplink traffic load cells.

This feature enhancement decreases the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCompUlDeltaSinrPuschDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCompUlDeltaSinrPuschDistr

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr
- EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr
- EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrHys
- EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrHys

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp

The recommended value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or

the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute is

400. In high uplink traffic load cells, the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute can be set to a

smaller value to rule out more users from Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.

A smaller value might have a negative impact on the following KPIs:

- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput
- UL HARQ BLER

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

### 2.2.64 23.Q3: Enhanced Load Management for Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

This feature enhancement improves the

robustness of the node in the network

after the

Uplink CoMP is enabled.

| Access Type            | LTE                                        |
| Upgrade at Impact      | Mandatory                                  |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement reduces the PUSCH receiver processing load, and improves the

robustness

after

the Uplink CoMP is enabled

based

on the following processes:

- Identification of Uplink CoMP users and non-uplink CoMP users
- Definition of different PUSCH receiver processing load consumption for Uplink CoMP users and non-uplink CoMP users

This feature enhancement supports the mixed Uplink CoMP and non-uplink CoMP

users.

Capacity and Performance

With

this feature enhancement,

Uplink

Medium Access Control (MAC) throughput for each BBM might

increase,

when the following conditions are

both

met:

- There are both Uplink CoMP and non-Uplink CoMP users in high Uplink traffic load cases.
- Most of the users are non-Uplink CoMP users, and fewer users are Uplink CoMP users. The specific proportion of Uplink CoMP users is difficult to predict, since it is related to the distribution of users and the user traffic model in network.

In other cases,

the

Uplink throughput and PUSCH receiver processing load decreases,

while the robustness of the node increases.

Operation

The default values of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr

attribute and the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute

are changed from 150 to 400. As a result, more UEs

are selected as Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception users, Uplink throughput

might degrade in high Uplink load

scenario.

In high Uplink traffic load cases, it is recommended to set the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or

EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to a value

smaller

than 400 to improve

the

robustness. Decreasing the value of these attributes might

increase Uplink throughput, but the exact value depends on the site settings.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

For this feature enhancement, Uplink CoMP-capable hardware is needed.

This feature enhancement

is

applicable to

LTE

FDD and LTE TDD hardware. For more information, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive

IoT RAN.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory               | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

The following Public Warning System feature processes are updated for all MORAN on

single Baseband participating operators:

- The eNodeB filters the cells for message broadcast based on the MORAN on single Baseband participating operator core network from which the S1AP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message is received.
- The S1AP PWS RESTART INDICATION message is sent to all affected MORAN on single Baseband participating operators after eNodeB restart or recovery from complete S1-C link failure.
- When the MORAN on single Baseband configuration is used, the eNodeB filters the cells that must stop the CMAS notification broadcast. The filtering is based on the MORAN on single Baseband operator core network from which the S1AP KILL REQUEST message with the CMAS notification is received.

The benefit of this feature enhancement is that the updated Public Warning System

feature processes enable support for the MORAN on single Baseband Shared LTE RAN

configuration.

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrResLongUtilCell
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPucchSrResLongUtilCell

Operation

This feature enhancement does not support the Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

feature.

The feature enhancement updates the

ENodeBFunction.ulPhyProcResTradingEnabled attribute by

setting the default value from 0 to 2 to enable

Flexible Uplink Processing feature. With this value, the following attributes can be

used to configure PUCCH capacity in each cell:

- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers
- EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers
- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers
- EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers

The feature enhancement optimizes the use of the values of the

ENodeBFunction.ulPhyProcResTradingEnabled attribute, because

the previous non-default settings have the same behavior as the 1

value that is used to enable the feature with the configuration of the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchFormat1PrbPairsPerFrameConf
- EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchFormat1PrbPairsPerFrameConf
- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchFormat2PrbPairsPerFrameConf
- EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchFormat2PrbPairsPerFrameConf

If ulPhyProcResTradingEnabled is set to a non-zero value, the

system automatically changes it to 1 after the software

upgrade.

If ulPhyProcResTradingEnabled is set to a default value, the

system automatically changes it to 2 after the software

upgrade.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

FDD and TDD AAS are not supported by this feature enhancement.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                       |

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement enables the eNodeB to queue E-RAB setup requests during CGI

reporting and to handle them after the procedure is completed. E-RAB setup requests

are still rejected if the CGI reporting is started by one of the following

features

or feature enhancements:

- The Non-planned PCI Range feature
- The Living with PCI Conflicts feature enhancement of the Automated Neighbor Relations feature

Depending on the network environment, this system improvement can have the following

benefits:

- Fewer E-RAB setup requests are rejected during CGI reporting because of interactions with another procedure.
- The number of E-RAB setup attempts decreases and the number of successes increases.
- KPIs measuring added E-RAB establishment success rate show better results.

For more information on E-RAB management procedures, see 3GPP TS 36.413

version 15.5.0 or later.

Capacity and Performance

The queuing of E-RAB setup requests decreases the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabAttAdded

- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedOngoingProc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedOngoingProc

This system improvement introduces updated versions of existing KPIs. Compared to

their legacy counterparts, the values of the updated KPIs increase because they do

not count E-RAB setup requests containing E-RAB IDs that are already in use.

Operation

This system improvement introduces the

ENodeBFunction.queueErabSetupDuringCgiMeas attribute to

enable or disable E-RAB setup request queuing. The default setting of the attribute

is true.

This system improvement introduces the following PM counters to measure the number of

E-RAB setup requests containing IDs that are already in use:

- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUse
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUse
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUse
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUseArp
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUseArp
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUseQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabFailAddedErabIdInUseQci

The following KPIs are introduced:

- Added E-RAB Establishment Success Rate 23.Q3 and later Note: The Added E-RAB Establishment Success Rate 23.Q3 and later KPI is also increased if it is compensated or differentiated using flexible PM counters.
- Added E-RAB Establishment Success Rate for Emergency Calls 23.Q3 and later
- Added E-RAB Establishment Success Rate per QCI 23.Q3 and later

The following KPIs are marked as deprecated and are planned to be removed:

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                                     |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement excludes the source NR frequency from connected mode and

idle mode mobility back to NR Standalone when the UE is moved to LTE by the

Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function. As a result, the UE avoids the

undesired ping-pong effect.

A cell relation must exist to enable matching the NCGI measurement with the NR

frequency.

Capacity and Performance

The number of mobility actions to NR Standalone can decrease when this feature

enhancement is operable.

Operation

The ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled MO attribute is

introduced.

The DisabledMobilityModeBackToNr enum is introduced by the

ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute to

manage mobility to the related NR frequency.

This

feature enhancement is operable when the

EnodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set

to a value other than 0.

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to observe the number

of times the NR frequency is ignored as target for mobility:

- GUtranFreqRelation.pmConnModeMobilityExcluded
- GUtranFreqRelation.pmIdleModeMobilityExcluded

This feature enhancement introduces the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_FREQUENCY\_EXCLUDED PM event.

It

is created when NR frequency is excluded from mobility back to NR.

In idle mode mobility, the NR Mobility After Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System

Handover function operates on an already prepared IMMCI IE. The activation of a

feature triggering the IMMCI IE creation and addition to the

RRCConnectionRelease message is required.

Interfaces

No Impact

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

UEs must support connected mode and idle mode mobility to NR Standalone to fully

benefit from this enhancement.

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement introduces the ExtendedTransport MO

class                 as a structural MO class that represents Transport features on the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance other than the primary

core.

Observability and troubleshooting are improved for eCPRI links by aligning the

EthernetPort MO instance on the TnPort and

the RiPort MO classes.

Capacity and Performance

The following Ethernet-related counters are applicable for eCPRI links:

- ifHCInOctets
- ifHCInBroadcastPkts
- ifHCInMulticastPkts
- ifHCInUcastPkts
- ifHCOutBroadcastPkts
- ifHCOutMulticastPkts
- ifHCOutOctets
- ifHCOutUcastPkts
- ifInErrors
- ifOutErrors

Operation

- It is not needed to manually configure the EthernetPort MO instance for RiPort MO instances.
- A read-only EthernetPort MO instance is created when Ethernet-based Radio Link Control is established.
- Any configuration of the EthernetPort MO instance for the RiPort MO instance by the operator is rejected.
- The EthernetPort MO instance for the RiPort MO instance can be manually deleted by the operator.
- The RiEthernetPort MO instance is deprecated and is not to be used any longer for eCPRI link observability and troubleshooting.

For RiPort MO instances, when using the Ethernet transmission

standard that is part of a Field Replaceable Unit other than the primary core, a

single ExtendedTransport MO instance is created automatically

under the relevant FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance.

The automatically created MO instance then has a child

EthernetPort MO instance for each such

RiPort MO instance, with encapsulation to the

RiPort MO instance.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This system improvement is applicable for Baseband units that are capable of

eCPRI.

Other Network Elements

ENM version ENM 23.4 or later is required for this system improvement.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement prevents unnecessary EN-DC setup attempts and unwanted LTE

RRC Connection Re-establishment after PSCell change during the Master Node Initiated

Secondary Node Modification procedure.

This is only applicable when intra-band EN-DC is blocked.

Capacity and Performance

The decrease in the number of EN-DC setup attempts can be observed with the following

PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttEndcSetup
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttEndcSetup

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the X2-C interface because the X2AP protocol is

updated to support the SCG-related overheating information. In case of the X2AP

protocol, the SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message is updated.

During the Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure, the

SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message also contains the PCell

frequency information, except during SCG release.

The Secondary Node uses this information to prevent intra-band EN-DC configuration

when performing PSCell and SCell selection. The Secondary Node sends the PSCell and

SCell frequency information to the Master Node using the SGNB MODIFICATION

REQUIRED message. The Master Node uses this information to prevent

intra-band EN-DC configuration when performing SCell selection.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement prevents unnecessary EN-DC setup attempts and unwanted LTE

RRC Connection Re-establishment after PSCell change during the Master Node Initiated

Secondary Node Modification procedure.

This is only applicable when intra-band EN-DC is blocked.

Capacity and Performance

The decrease in the number of EN-DC setup attempts can be observed with the following

PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttEndcSetup
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttEndcSetup

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the X2-C interface because the X2AP protocol is

updated to support the SCG-related overheating information. In case of the X2AP

protocol, the SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message is updated.

During the Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure, the

SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message also contains the PCell

frequency information, except during SCG release.

The Secondary Node uses this information to prevent intra-band EN-DC configuration

when performing PSCell and SCell selection. The Secondary Node sends the PSCell and

SCell frequency information to the Master Node using the SGNB MODIFICATION

REQUIRED message. The Master Node uses this information to prevent

intra-band EN-DC configuration when performing SCell selection.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

This feature enhancement ensures balanced processing load for the PRACH receiver on

the TTI level. If the PRACH load is high in a given TTI, the processing cycle

resources for PUCCH and PUSCH are reduced in it.

As a result, fewer UEs can be scheduled with the uplink traffic, which improves

system stability.

### 2.2.103 23.Q4: LTE Mobility Improvement

This system improvement enables the release of source cell resources by the target

cell during intra-eNodeB handovers and connection reestablishments where UEs are set up with

SCG radio resources. The release is done independently of the E-RAB modification

confirmation.

| Feature Name           | System Improvements in L23.Q4   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | 39/FAJ 121 1447                 |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                       |

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement prevents the prolonged storing of UEs with established

context in the source cell and in the gNodeB.

Some intra-eNodeB handovers where the UE had the SCG radio resources set up were

previously considered failed handovers. These handovers are now counted as

successful, therefore, improvement in certain KPIs is expected. The release of

source cell resources by the target cell during intra-eNodeB handover indicates to

the source cell that the handover is successful, and the

pmCellHoExeSuccLteIntraF PM counter is incremented on the

source cell.

Capacity and Performance

This system improvement can have an impact on the following KPIs:

- Cell Handover Execution Success Rate
- Cell Handover Success Rate
- Cell Mobility Success Rate
- Intra-Frequency Cell Mobility Success Rate

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The UeContextRelease message is sent from the target cell to the

source cell during intra-eNodeB handovers and connection reestablishments where UEs

are set up with SCG radio resources. This is done independently of the result of the

E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message. The E-RAB MODIFICATION

CONFIRM message can include the following:

- Success
- Failure
- Time-out

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Description of Correction

The uplink throughput of a single user that takes full buffer traffic service might

decrease, for example, a single user, which takes peak throughput test or

competition test. The greater the number of cells and background users, the more

obvious the degradation becomes.

To avoid single user uplink throughput decreasing in full buffer traffic service use

case, the recommendations are the following:

- For long-term solution, turn on the Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature.
- For short-term solution, set the value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to equal or smaller than 150.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                   |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement extends the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature to initiate

both blind and measurement-based mobility actions to NR standalone networks if the

UE measures poor LTE coverage. The feature enhancement also introduces

the

B2 NR event measurement framework for UE mobility actions if the LTE coverage is

poor.

The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature can also interact with the Mobility Control at

Poor Coverage feature, as well as the MBMS service.

This feature enhancement provides additional mobility actions for UEs, which can

improve UE performance through offering the option for coverage by the best

available network.

This feature enhancement has the following

limitations:

- If the UE reports the PCI as unknown in the B2 NR measurement report, the ANR does not create neighbor relations between the serving cell and the reported cell.
- If the Cell Soft Lock feature is active in the cell, during the soft lock phase, no B2 NR measurements are performed when VoLTE is established for the UE. Additionally, NR cells are not considered as valid mobility targets for such UEs.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement can

improve UE performance by increasing the chance

for coverage by the best available network.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces support for the inner and outer search zones, as

well as the critical zone, for mobility actions to NR frequencies if the Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage feature is also active in the node.

This feature enhancement introduces the ReportConfigB2NR MO

class                 under the existing UeMeasControl MO class to configure B2 NR

event measurements. The ReportConfigB2NR MO class contains the

following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelSCNr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNr

This feature enhancement can increase the following counters, as more UE mobility

actions can occur:

- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSucc
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSucc

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the Uu interface. The RRC protocol is updated with

the following IEs:

PLMNs on the list are compared with the PLMN supported by the UE.

If the PLMN supported by a UE is not present on the list, CGI measurements are not

triggered, and handover attempts to unsupported femtocells are avoided.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Handover success rate is increased.
- Unnecessary UE measurements are avoided.
- Unnecessary signaling between the UE and the eNodeB is reduced.

Capacity and Performance

The

feature enhancement prevents unnecessary CGI measurements if the

PLMN of the UE is not supported by the femtocell.

This

means that the downlink throughput is not decreased by

unnecessary measurements for UEs that belong to PLMNs that are not supported by the

femtocell.

This feature enhancement improves handover success rate, which can be observed with

the following PIs:

- Mobility Cell Intra-Frequency Femto Success Rate
- Mobility Cell Inter-Frequency Femto Success Rate

The following existing counters can be monitored to observe the improved handover

success rate:

- pmCellHoPrepAttLteIntraFNpPCI
- pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFNpPCI
- pmCellHoPrepSuccLteIntraFNpPCI
- pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFNpPCI
- pmCellHoExeAttLteIntraFNpPCI
- pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFNpPCI
- pmCellHoExeSuccLteIntraFNpPCI
- pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFNpPCI

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

EutranFreqRelation.nonPlannedPciAllowedPlmnList attribute.

This attribute is used to configure up to six supported PLMNs.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces MOM structure support for multiple NR TACs and the

associated PLMN information in the NCGI report. Existing LTE-to-NR Standalone

relations are updated automatically based on the NCGI report in the B1 NR Standalone

measurement.

The handover evaluation process of the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is updated

to support the MOM structure change and consider the available NR TACs and the

associated PLMNs in each cell.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The eNodeB MOM structure supports the NR TACs and PLMNs of additional operators that use the shared neighbor NR cell.
- Handover options increase for UEs because of the updated handover evaluation process of the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature.
- Additional LTE-to-NR Standalone relations are created automatically if the first PLMN does not support mobility and at least one additional PLMN does.

Capacity and Performance

The eNodeB can access the NR TAC and the PLMN information of the operators that share

the same NR cell. This results in the following changes:

- The number of LTE-to-NR Standalone relations increases.Note: This is only applicable if the first PLMN does not support mobility and at least one additional PLMN does.
- The number of successful NR IRAT handover attempts increases.

The introduced eNodeB MOM structure allows the creation of new LTE-to-NR Standalone

relations and handover to the additional PLMNs of the shared NR cell. The feature

enhancement can be observed with the following existing PM

counters:

- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSucc
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSucc

The

behavior of the feature enhancement can be observed with the following

events:

- INTERNAL\_PROC\_HO\_EXEC\_S1\_OUT
- INTERNAL\_PROC\_HO\_PREP\_S1\_OUT
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NEIGHBGNB\_CHANGE

Operation

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature must be activated for the

feature enhancement to operate. This is a prerequisite for creating Automated

Neighbor Relations for LTE-to-NR Standalone neighbor cell relations.

The legacy feature enhancement for the automatic creation of LTE-to-NR Standalone

relations is a prerequisite for this feature enhancement to operate.

The feature enhancement is applicable for new LTE-to-NR Standalone relations.

Existing LTE-to-NR Standalone relations are automatically updated after activating

the feature enhancement. The update is requested by the UE and is based on the B1 NR

Standalone measurement.

The feature enhancement introduces the

GutranCellRelation.mobilityStatusNR attribute, which is

automatically created based on the NR TAC value and shows the mobility status

information of the neighbor NR cell.

The feature enhancement introduces the

ExternalGUtranCell.ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO class for the

neighbor NR cell shared by multiple operators. The attributes in this MO

class                 contain the NR TAC and the associated PLMN information. The

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO class and the attributes under

it are created and deleted automatically by the Automated Neighbor Relations

feature. The following attributes in the

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO class are also introduced:

- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.createdBy
- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.externalBroadcastPLMNInfoId
- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList
- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC

If the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList and the

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attributes are manually

configured by the operator, the Automated Neighbor Relations feature does not

overwrite them automatically. If the configuration of the

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList and the

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attributes change on the

gNodeB side after activating the feature enhancement, the eNodeB MOM structure can

only be updated manually.

A maximum of 12 ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances can exist

at the same time in each ExternalGUtranCell MO instance. A

maximum of 12 unique PLMN IDs are supported across the

ExternalGUtranCell MO instance, including all

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances.

The handover evaluation process of the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is updated.

If at least one ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instance exists, the

handover evaluation process checks all available information about the NR TAC and

the associated PLMNs only in the attributes that belong to the

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances. If there are no

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances, then the handover

evaluation process checks the ExternalGUtranCell MO instance.

If the first PLMN does not support mobility and at least one additional PLMN does, a

new LTE-to-NR Standalone relation is created. The following conditions must be true

to create the relation:

- The value of the associated ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute of the first PLMN in the NCGI report is -1 or 0.
- The value of the associated ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute of at least one additional PLMN of the shared NR cell is higher than 0.

Each PLMN across the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList attribute

must have a unique ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute

value, except when the value of the

ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute is empty.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The UE must be capable of LTE-to-NR Standalone and support the

reportCGI-NR-EN-DC-r15 and the

reportCGI-NR-NoEN-DC-r15 UE capabilities.

It is required to use ENM version 23.03 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.

Without ENM, parameters can only be configured through

MOShell.

Summary and Benefits

Enabling uplink SRS when there are many connected UEs might affect the KPIs of

neighbor cells.

Capacity

and Performance

When uplink SRS is enabled, connected UEs send SRS with full band to the eNodeB on

special subframes 1 and 6, even if there is no uplink traffic. This SRS might cause

higher interference to neighbor cells compared with uplink traffic. As a result, if

there are many connected UEs, the KPIs of neighbor cells might be affected in the

following way:

- RSSI degradation
- Decreased SINR in special subframes 1 and 6

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

mobility to an NR network can be differentiated for each subscriber by configuring

subscriber-based priorities for NR frequencies. This prioritization overrides

existing voice connection priorities defined in

GutranFreqRelation MO instances.

Operators can decide whether to transfer all UEs with an ongoing VoLTE connection or

only some of them to achieve the desired network effect. This can be configured with

the use of voice-specific configuration attributes.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the FreqPrioNR.voicePrio

attribute that enables frequency prioritization for handovers with an ongoing VoLTE

connection. The FreqPrioNR.voicePrio attribute is operable only

when the ENodeBFunction.voiceHoToNrEnabled attribute is set to

true.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                      |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves the NR Standalone frequency priority handling with

the introduction of different time-to-trigger values for NR SA B1 measurements and a

configurable time window.

The different time-to-trigger values for each frequency relation increase the

flexibility of measurement configuration and band priority control.

The configurable time window allows more time for the UE to report the availability

of a higher priority cell.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on the GutranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override

attribute settings, the number of handovers might decrease or increase. The lower

the value, the greater number of handover attempts are possible.

The configuration of the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attribute

might affect the mobility performance by delaying mobility action.

If the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override and the

UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attributes are used together,

the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override attribute must

be set to a lower value for a higher priority frequency. Improper configuration

might cause unnecessary delay in the mobility action to NR Standalone. As a result,

the number of handover reattempts might increase.

Operation

The following attributes are introduced:

- GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override
- UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the RRC protocol on the Uu interface. Time-to-trigger

values are sent in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message during

the measurement configuration.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.16 22.4 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release

Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier

ENM versions also.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows searching for preemptable UEs in all active cells

configured for inter-cell UE preemption, other than the cell where a UE with

preemption authority requests admission.

When UE preemption is unsuccessful in the cell where the UE with preemption authority

requests admission, and there is UE congestion on the eNodeB or the Baseband level,

inter-cell UE preemption is initiated. If the candidate cell valid for inter-cell UE

preemption is selected from the list of cells reported as candidates, UE preemption

is started in that cell. If inter-cell UE preemption is unsuccessful, there are no

further UE preemption attempts.

Additional UE preemption is started in the selected cell from the list of cells

reported as candidates for inter-cell UE preemption. If UE preemption fails in the

selected cell, no further UE preemption attempts are performed in other candidate

cells.

The benefit of the feature enhancement is that there is a higher chance for HPA and

emergency call users to be admitted into a cell during UE congestion on the eNodeB

or the Baseband level.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement does not impact cell UE capacity.

The Accessibility and Mobility main KPIs increase for HPA

and emergency call users compared to non-privileged access users. The

Retainability main KPI decreases for non-privileged access users

compared to HPA and emergency call users. These KPI changes are observable only when

there is UE congestion on the Baseband or the eNodeB level.

The following

existing

PM counters can be used to observe the number of RRC Connection Request attempts and

their success rate for HPA UEs:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa

The following PM counters are introduced to observe the number of successful UE

context releases caused by inter-cell UE preemption:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPeInterCell
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPeInterCell

The feature enhancement updates the EVENT\_PARAM\_UE\_PREEMPTION\_CAUSE PM

event parameter with the following values:

- EVENT\_VALUE\_INTER\_CELL\_UE\_PREEMPTION
- EVENT\_VALUE\_PREEMPTION\_CELL\_THRESHOLD\_EXCEEDED

The activation of the Differentiated Admission Control feature is a prerequisite for

this feature enhancement. The

AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState attribute can be

used to activate or deactivate ARP-based preemption.

### 2.3.19 23.Q2: NR Frequency Inclusion in IMMCI for Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

With this feature enhancement, NR

frequencies are included in the IMMCI for idle mode mobility of the NR standalone-capable

UEs.

Summary and Benefits

If this feature enhancement is enabled, the NR frequencies are added to the IMMCI

during the RRC Connection Release procedure based on the configured cell reselection

priorities and

subpriorities.NR

standalone-capable UEs can connect to NR frequencies faster because the UEs can

reselect NR frequencies in idle mode from the IMMCI.

While the UePolicyOptimization.t320 timer is running, the NR

standalone-capable UEs immediately select the NR frequency that is included in the

IMMCI. This is possible only if the UE is in the coverage of the NR cell in idle

mode and the SIB24 is broadcast.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits

for

NR standalone-capable UEs in NR coverage in idle mode:

- NR-standalone capable UEs can be steered in idle mode to be provided with NR coverage in connected mode.
- The duration of NR service delays is reduced.

Capacity and Performance

The Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

features allow the inclusion of the selected NR frequencies based on the cell

reselection priorities and subpriorities of the

GUtranFreqRelation MO in the IMMCI.

When

the IMMCI is signaled to NR standalone-capable UEs for idle mode mobility control,

the number of RRC connections to the LTE cell are reduced. Because of this, the NR

standalone-capable UEs are steered to the NR cell.

Operation

The feature enhancement is enabled by setting the

UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute to

2. This affects NR standalone-capable UEs during connection

release if the UE qualifies to be released with prioritized EN-DC or TM9-capable

frequencies. If this configuration is used, the frequency selection process is

performed according to the following steps:

1. EN-DC or TM9-capable frequencies are prioritized.
2. NR frequencies for which the value of the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority attribute is equal to or greater than 0 are selected.
3. NR frequencies with the value of 0 in the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute are disregarded.
4. The RRC Connection Release procedure is performed to the UE with EN-DC or TM9-capable frequencies and NR frequencies in the IMMCI.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                             |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces interaction between the Intelligent Power Emission

Control and Carrier Aggregation features. The feature enhancement enables predicting

and controlling the power density to comply with EIRP exposure regulations for the

separated sector or cell. Global SCell Evaluation is updated with a modified

algorithm for bandwidth factor based on the power limitations for SCell selection or

reselection. This improves Carrier Aggregation throughput when the number of PRBs is

limited by the Intelligent Power Emission Control feature.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The Intelligent Power Emission Control feature can keep the network compliant with EIRP exposure regulations and simultaneously coexist with the Carrier Aggregation feature.
- The Global SCell Evaluation feature is updated with an enhanced algorithm for bandwidth factor to improve UE throughput when the number of PRBs is limited by power backoff.

Capacity and Performance

Carrier Aggregation throughput is increased. This also increases the Average DL PDCP

UE Throughput for Carrier Aggregation KPI.

The following PM counters can be used for further observation of the performance

improvement:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbCa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbLastTTICa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpTimeDlCa

| Impact at Upgrade:      | Optional                 | Optional                       |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary clocks

to use SyncE and OTA as assisting time references.

The feature enhancement also allows Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary

clocks to distribute SyncE in assisted mode to cascaded Baseband nodes. This allows

cascaded Baseband nodes to synchronize with the Baseband node configured as boundary

clock. The following limitations apply:

- Only Baseband nodes within one hop of each other are supported.
- Only Ericsson Baseband nodes are supported.
- Baseband nodes that are configured as PTP grandmasters are not supported.

This feature enhancement provides the benefit of prolonged time holdover. If the GNSS

or PTP G.2875.1 primary reference fails, Baseband nodes that are configured as

boundary clocks use SyncE or OTA as an assisting reference.

Capacity and Performance

If the primary reference fails, but a SyncE or OTA assisting reference is available,

this feature enhancement keeps time-dependent services enabled. As a result, the

value of the RadioEquipmentClock.timeAssistedHoldoverSec PM

counter continues to increase.

This impact is applicable to the following nodes:

- Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary clocks
- Cascaded Baseband nodes

Operation

The IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock feature (FAJ 121 4755) must be activated to use this

feature enhancement.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The SyncE source must have PRTC or ePRTC quality level.

All network elements that distribute SyncE must support ESMC with at least QL

TLV.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following benefit:

- An advanced filter capability is introduced to allow the user to define precise conditions that examine variable contents of alarm or alert fields. These conditions decide if a notification is sent out to ENM or suppressed.

The introduced mechanism is a general Fault Management function. The function is

applicable for all alarms and alerts generated in the node. This includes all Radio

Access Technologies deployed in the node.

Suppressed alarms and alerts are still logged on the node in Alarm Log and Alert

Log.

The FmAlarm MO is instantiated for all active alarms whether they

have been notified or not.

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement provides

the

possibility to configure

an

MO

attribute

for all supported AISG 3.0 devices

based

on the results returned by

Antenna

Device Scan. The automated configuration supports full Antenna

Device Scan at initial integration as well as periodical background scanning.

Keeping

track of

hardware

IDs for AISG devices at site integration

is

automatic with this improvement, along with

the

input

of

hardware-specific

data to establish connection with connected AISG devices.

As a benefit of the system improvement, autoconfiguration

is

supported for AISG 3.0 units as well.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following

introduced

attribute is used to enable and disable the system improvement:

- EquipmentDiscovery.autoCreateAisgUnits

The following limitations apply to this system improvement:

- This system improvement is only supported for radio units that fully support Antenna Device Scan.
- Limitations to supported site configurations: AISG devices are connected in one Antenna Unit Group for a single radio. Otherwise, RBS is able to identify the proper AntennaUnitGroup MO, which is to be a parent for newly created AntennaNearUnit MOs. AISG devices that are connected to a TMA or an RIU and not directly connected to a single or a cascaded radio serve the same antenna as the TMA. This enables solving the MO reference between AntennaSubunit and AISG device.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

To allow autoconfiguration for AISG

3.0,

devices

that support

the

AISG

device standard are required. The supported

devices are MALD and SALD.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                          | Optional                        |

Summary and Benefits

With this system improvement, the user is able to activate PIM cancellation in the

radio unit to suppress in-line PIM in individual antenna ports. Activating PIM

cancellation requires one HWAC license for each radio and each node. PIM sources

considered are non-linear or stable. Non-linear PIM sources have the following

characteristics:

- No saturation of third-order and fifth-order inter modulation products
- Third-order inter modulation is stronger than fifth-order

The characteristics of stable PIM sources vary because of temperature and aging.

This system improvement provides the following benefits:

- Mitigation of the sensitivity degradation caused by PIM. Receiver sensitivity is impacted if PIM overlaps receiver signals in the spectrum. With PIM cancellation, the overlapping PIM is suppressed, which improves the receiver sensitivity.
- Improved uplink KPIs for NR and LTE FDD radio units
- Improved uplink throughput
- Fewer site visits for PIM source cleaning

Capacity and Performance

PIM cancellation protects uplink signals by suppressing third- and fifth-order

in-line PIM that is generated by downlink signals.

Operation

The following attributes are used for PIM cancellation configuration:

- PimcHwacControl.pimcEnabled
- PimcHwacControl.pimcHwacAllocated

The radio unit must be locked before the PIM cancellation configuration is changed

and then unlocked.

The PIM cancellation performance can be observed through the following PM

counters:

- RfPort.pmPimcCancellationDepth
- RfPort.pmPimcPowerSignalInjected

During the configuration of PIM

cancellation,

the following alarms can be raised:

- The MO Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the Key alarm indicates the shortage of PIM cancellation HWAC licenses. PIM cancellation configuration requires one HWAC license for each radio and each node.
- The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm indicates that the radio is not supported for PIM cancellation.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The system improvement is supported on the following hardware units:

- Radio 2262
- Radio 4490
- Radio 4490HP 44B1 44B3 C
- RAN Compute Groups 3-5

For more information on specific RAN Compute units, see DU and Baseband

Configurations and Capacity in the Radio Node Configurations library.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 21.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced

by this system improvement.

Summary and Benefits

The

features affected by this feature enhancement prioritize the NR frequencies in IMMCI

based on the comparison of the relative priority values set for LTE frequencies and

NR frequencies. These priority values are configured by the operator. The

NR

frequencies are assigned with dedicated priorities for IMMCI based on the relative

priority order. This way, the

NR

and LTE frequencies are sorted in a relative priority order in the IMMCI signaled to

the NR standalone-capable UE during the RRC Connection Release procedure. The NR

standalone-capable UE uses the NR frequencies in IMMCI for cell reselection in idle

mode.

This

feature enhancement increases the chance for NR standalone-capable UEs to be steered

to the desired LTE or NR frequency in idle mode by considering the priority order

between the LTE and NR frequencies. The priority order is configured by the

operator.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is used to enable

this feature enhancement. If the

UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to

3, the

NR

frequencies in IMMCI are prioritized by the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and

the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control features for NR standalone-capable UEs.

The process considers the relative priority order between the

LTE

frequencies and NR frequencies.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement modifies the procedure of scanning a node with device scan

to allow the targeting of specific ports and reduces the duration of the current

procedure to a few seconds or minutes depending on the configuration.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

EquipmentDiscovery.targetLdn attribute, which allows the

targetability of the device scan. When the targetLdn attribute is

left empty, the AISG device scan procedure scans the whole node according to the

chosen portConfiguration. When the targetLdn

attribute is set to either radio or rfPort LDNs,

then only the selected MOs are scanned. If the targetLdn

attribute contains both radio and rfPort LDNs,

then the performFullAntennaDeviceScan action is rejected with an

inconsistent configuration error. When the

EquipmentDiscovery.antennaDeviceScanInBackground attribute is

set to TRUE the targetLdn attribute is ignored,

and a full scan is executed.

The feature enhancement introduces the following values to the

EquipmentDiscovery.portConfiguration attribute:

- SCAN\_AC\_PORTS\_ONLY
- SCAN\_RF\_PORTS\_ONLY

If a targetLdn contains one or more MOs of

rfPorts, then the portConfiguration

attribute is ignored and only rfPorts specified in the

targetLdn are scanned.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement supports AISG 2.0 and AISG 3.0.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 23.1 or later is required for this feature

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                 |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, it is possible to automatically detect and report a

PCI conflict or the resolution of a PCI conflict for NR neighbor cells in LTE.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- With this enhancement, the operator can quickly detect and resolve PCI conflicts.
- The information supplied by the feature enhancement can be used for PCI planning in customer networks to avoid PCI conflict on NR cells.
- The NR PCI conflict reporting function is applicable for ANR-created and manually created neighbor configurations.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute is introduced

to enable the feature enhancement for LTE, for NR, or for both.

The following attributes are introduced to provide information about NR PCI conflict

and conflict resolving:

- ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict
- ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflictCell
- ExternalGUtranCell.pciDetectingCell

The following PM events are introduced to provide information about NR PCI conflict

and conflict resolving:

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_DETECTED
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_RESOLVED

If the feature is planned to be activated on a large number of nodes in one ENM

deployment, it is recommended to only activate a few hundred nodes every few hours.

Otherwise, too many CM notifications might be generated for the newly detected PCI

conflict cells at feature activation, which increases ENM load.

The feature enhancement allows up to two NR PCI conflict cells to be reported even in

cases when more than two cells exist with PCI conflict.

ANR can only configure EN-DC-capable NR cells as an NR neighbor cell with PCI

conflict in LTE.

Interfaces

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement detects the NR neighbor cell where PCI conflict is suspected.

It continues to search for another NR cell that has the same PCI, and if it finds

one, it creates a cell relation by adding the other NR cell as a new neighbor cell.

This behavior results in a fast NR PCI conflict detection.

Operation

The enhancement enables the SPID-based frequency relation differentiation of UE in

the cell for connected and idle mode mobility. When a configured profile is assigned

to an E-UTRAN or NR frequency relation, new priority parameter values are applied

for the matching SPIDs.

The following MO attributes are introduced:

- EUtraFreqRelProfile.arpPrio
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.cellReselectionPriority
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.loadBalancingAllowed
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.ueProfileFilterRef
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.voicePrio
- EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef
- GUtraFreqRelProfile.cellReselectionPrio
- GUtraFreqRelProfile.connModeMobilityPrio
- GUtraFreqRelProfile.ueProfileFilterRef
- GUtraFreqRelProfile.voicePrio
- GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef
- UeProfileFilter.spidList
- UeProfileFilter.t320
- UeProfileFilter.ueCapPrioAllowed

If the RFPM function of the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is active,

parameters from the following MO class and MO structure can be overridden on cell

level:

- FreqPrioNR
- FreqPrioEUTRA

If the RATFreqPrio MO is not used, then corresponding

parameters on respective frequency relations can be differentiated using SPID

value.

If priority values are duplicated between different RATs at cell reselection, the PM

event related to the RRCConnectionRelease message has the

IMMCI\_VALID parameter set to false.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement enables setting equal cell reselection priority for

different RATs. If the cell reselection priority configuration leads to duplicates,

then the idleModeMobilityControlInfo IE is not sent in the

RRCConnectionRelease message.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

### 2.3.46 23.Q4: Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

This feature enhancement enables MIMO sleep state to activate during cell sleep mode

time windows if conditions for MIMO reduction are met.

| Feature Name           | Cell Sleep Mode     |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4390        |

| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0413        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to have both Cell Sleep Mode and

MIMO Sleep Mode features activated at the same time. During the cell sleep mode time

window, MIMO sleep detection can be triggered. If the conditions for entering MIMO

sleep mode are met, and cell sleep state is not active during the cell sleep mode

time window, MIMO sleep state can be active.

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can also be active during the cell sleep

mode time window. This extends the time of operation of the LTE AI Powered MIMO

Sleep Mode feature to 24 hours regardless of the time window settings of the Cell

Sleep Mode feature.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- MIMO sleep detection and MIMO sleep state can start during cell sleep mode time window.
- The energy consumption of the radio unit is lowered because of the deactivation of additional antenna branches.

Capacity and Performance

The following PM counters affected by the MIMO Sleep Mode feature might further

increase:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmMimoSleepTime
- EUtranCellTDD.pmMimoSleepTime

The following benefits of the full MIMO configuration are temporarily reduced or

unavailable when MIMO sleep state is active:

- Coverage for low SINR users
- Throughput for low SINR users
- Peak throughput for high SINR users

Operation

The following setting is recommended for thresholds of the Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO

Sleep Mode features:

- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownPrbThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute.
- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownRrcConnThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellRrcConnSleepThreshold attribute.

For the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature to trigger MIMO sleep state during the

cell sleep mode time window, the

CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute is

recommended to be set to less than 10%. The reason for this is the fixed PRB

threshold for the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

node level for TDD cells. Each cell can be configured and activated with the

transmission mode based on its TX antenna as

TM2,

TM3, TM4, TM7 or TM8.

This system improvement enables the Single Layer Beamforming Performance Package

feature and the Dual Layer Beamforming Performance Package feature to interact and

operate with the Dual Antenna Downlink Performance Package in a TDD cell.

This system improvement has the following benefits:

- Additional TM2 or TM4 transmission modes, other than TM3 only, can be applied to 2TX TDD and 4TX TDD cells that coexist with TM3, TM7, or TM8 8TX TDD cells.
- Additional transmission mode combinations of TM2, TM3, TM4, and TM8 can be supported for the following carrier aggregation types: Elastic RAN carrier aggregation Intra-eNodeB carrier aggregation Inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                         |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the Master Node to add overloaded NR cells to a

denylist. Cells added to the denylist are excluded from EN-DC-related procedures and

IRAT Handover procedures to NR SA. The period for which a cell remains in the

denylist is configurable.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- The signaling load is reduced in the Master Node for the following procedures: EN-DC setup SCG Addition Outgoing NR IRAT Handover
- Improved success rate of EN-DC procedures and IRAT Handover procedures to NR SA by excluding overloaded cells from the procedures.

The feature enhancement only considers Secondary Node Addition or SCG Addition

procedure failures. If the overloaded NR cell is only used in NR SA, a failed

handover does not trigger the feature enhancement. As a result, the cell is not

added to the NR cell denylist and it is not excluded from IRAT Handover

procedures.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement might improve the following KPIs:

- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in eNodeB
- Mobility Success Rate
- Cell Mobility Success Rate
- Handover Success Rate
- Cell Handover Success Rate
- Handover Execution Success Rate
- Cell Handover Execution Success Rate

Retainability might degrade in poor radio conditions because the UE might not be

moved to an available cell that has better conditions than the current cell.

Throughput for NR UEs might decrease. If the

ENodeBFunction.nrCellOverloadBackoffTime attribute is set to

a longer period than the amount of time the denylisted NR cell is overloaded, UEs

might stay connected to LTE cells longer, or EN-DC is set up with an NR cell that

provides worse conditions than the denylisted NR cell.

The feature enhancement improves the NR Handover Success Rate PI.

The value of the following PM counters might decrease:

- GUtranCellRelation.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- GUtranCellRelation.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmEndcSgnbAdditionRequest

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrq
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrq

Operation

During the Secondary Node Addition or the SCG Addition procedures, if the Master Node

receives the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST REJECT or the X2AP

SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST REJECT message with the cause value indicating

cell overload, the candidate cell is added to the NR cell denylist for a

configurable period. The feature enhancement introduces the

ENodeBFunction.nrCellOverloadBackoffTime attribute, through

which this period can be configured.

While the NR cell is included in the denylist, the cell is not considered a candidate

PSCell, and the cell is excluded from the following procedures:

- Configuration-based EN-DC setup
- Measurement-based EN-DC setup
- SCG Addition
- EN-DC-triggered handover
- LTE handover without Secondary Node change
- Outgoing NR IRAT Handover

The feature enhancement introduces the

ExternalGutranCell.pmBackoffTimeCellBarred PM counter.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
