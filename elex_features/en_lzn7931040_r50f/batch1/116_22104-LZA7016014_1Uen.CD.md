# 1 Dynamic UE Admission Control Overview

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature greatly improves retainability, UE

throughput, and eNodeB stability in certain overloaded scenarios by differentiating and

rejecting incoming requests to be admitted in the cell.

| Feature Name           | Dynamic UE Admission Control                                               |

| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                         |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature has the following benefits:

- Retainability KPIs are increased during overloaded situations because of the reduced number of RLFs.
- Risk is reduced that admitted UEs cannot be properly served according to QCI parameters (minimum bit rate, maximum waiting time, delay) because of the overload.
- The DRB-SRB traffic ratio is kept high during overloaded situations because of less signaling caused by the establishment or reestablishment of the radio links.

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature introduces several new PM counters and

updated events that provide details of MSR load utilization. This information can be

useful to plan expansions or capacity constraints, and to set up and tune the

admission thresholds.

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature offers admission control in the following

different places where UEs are entering the node:

- UEs requesting a connection establishment by sending the RRC Connection Request message to the eNodeB over the radio interface
- UEs requesting a connection reestablishment, for example after RLF, by sending the RRC Reestablishment Request message to the eNodeB over the radio interface
- UEs subject to handover from another cell on the same node (intra-node handover) or another eNodeB (inter-node handover)

Each decision on whether to accept or reject a UE depends on the current load in the

system and the configured thresholds. One threshold is employed for RRC connection

requests and a second threshold for reestablishment and handovers.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

To benefit from Dynamic UE Admission Control, the following need to be assigned:

- All traffic scheduling algorithms
- Configuration allowing for high-prioritized scheduling to happen

Examples of such configurations are described in QoS-Aware Scheduler, Delay-Based Scheduling and Grant Estimation, and Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler.

Resource Fair Scheduler configuration is described in this

feature.

# 3 Feature Operation

This section describes the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature

in more detail, including network configuration requirements and operation

flows.

## 3.1 Dynamic UE Admission Control Functionality

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature provides the capability to limit the amount of

resources used to schedule high-priority traffic to reduce the risk that admitted UEs cannot

be properly served. Any UE which is not properly served has an increased risk of experiencing

an RLF, rendering high-priority signalling associated with reestablishing the radio link. This

can reduce the number of UEs that the system can serve, causing the system to become unstable,

see Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows how the system becomes unstable and

can fail to serve the users at high load. The throughput, or DRB volume, rapidly degrades to

almost zero.

Figure 1   Problem Scenario

The resources must be limited by employing admission control. The UEs signaling that they

want to enter the node are rejected if the node is at risk of failing to serve already

admitted UEs. The system must prioritize already admitted UEs over accepting new ones.

## 3.2 Dynamic UE Admission Control Thresholds

The load in the system is measured and is denoted MSR.

Eleven defined MSRs are grouped into three MSR groups:

Five uplink MSRs:

- Uplink PRB utilization for each cell
- Uplink PRB utilization for each BBM
- Uplink SE or TTI utilization for each cell
- Uplink SE or TTI utilization for each BBM
- Uplink baseband capacity utilization for each BBM

Five downlink MSRs:

- Downlink PRB utilization for each cell
- Downlink PRB utilization for each BBM
- Downlink SE or TTI utilization for each cell
- Downlink SE or TTI utilization for each BBM
- Downlink baseband capacity utilization for each BBM

One downlink and uplink shared MSR:

- CCE utilization for each cell

These eleven MSRs are total MSRs in the sense that they reflect

GBR, non-GBR and Signaling Radio Bearers, in contrast to the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature which also utilize similar

MSRs, but only reflecting GBR load.

The MSRs are observed during a measurement period after which an averaged value for the MSR

usage is calculated.

Each MSR is further filtered by a corresponding EWMA filter using the filter time constant

set by the parameter EUtranCellFDD.dynUeAdmCtrlFilterConst or

EUtranCellTDD.dynUeAdmCtrlFilterConst.

These

attributes must be set to the same value for all cells in the same

eNodeB.

There are two different thresholds defined per MSR group. When any of the eleven filtered

MSRs is above a corresponding threshold, specific UEs are rejected.

The first threshold, xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr, xx meaning downlink,

uplink, or CCE MSR group, reserves a margin for reestablishments and handovers, while

rejecting UEs sending (initial) RRC Connection Request. The second

threshold, xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr, blocks everything except for

privileged access.

Figure 2 shows the admission policy with two

admission thresholds. Here xx means downlink, uplink, or CCE MSR group.

Figure 2   Admission Policy

When a UE is attempting to enter the node, the filtered result is compared to the two

thresholds as specified above. The result of this comparison determines whether the cell is

considered to be overloaded or not. If the cell is overloaded, it is also decided whether only

UEs entering via RRC connection request must be rejected, or if also

handovers and reestablishments must be rejected.

If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature considers the dynamic PTT downlink MSR reservation at MSR use calculation during the

admission threshold check.

Privileged Access

## 3.3 Thresholds for Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

If the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated,

three different thresholds are defined for each MSR group. When a UE attempts to connect

to the node, the filtered MSRs are compared to these three thresholds. The result of

this comparison determines whether the cell is considered to be overloaded or not. When

any of the filtered MSRs is above a corresponding threshold, specific UE access requests

are immediately rejected or queued instead. After a period, the queued requests can be

admitted or rejected depending on the availability of system resources. If the Enhanced

PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the downlink PTT dynamic MSR reservation is

also compared to the three different thresholds beside the filtered MSRs. The total load

is compared to the following thresholds:

Table 2   Thresholds to the Total Load Is Compared

| Thresholds  (1)             | Accepted UE Access Requests above the Threshold                      | Queued or Rejected UE Access Requests above the Threshold                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr    | Reestablishment and handover     Privileged Access (PA) request  (2) | RRC Connection Request                                                      |
| xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr   | PA request                                                           | RRC Connection Request     Reestablishment and handover  (3)                |
| xxDynUeAdmCtrlPaOverloadThr | No accepted UE access request                                        | RRC Connection Request     Reestablishment and handover     PA request  (4) |

(1)

The first two characters xx of the threshold

parameter names mean downlink, uplink, or CCE MSR group.

(2)

The following types of requests are considered

to be PA:

- RRC connection requests with emergency or high priority access establishment causes.
- For handover requests and RRC connection reestablishment requests, where any of the E-RABs has an Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level value equal to or below that of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute.
- With the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature activated, the mobile-terminating access requests with paging priority higher than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This threshold is configured by the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute.

(3)

Call queuing function is not available for

handover requests and RRC connection

reestablishment requests.

(4)

Call queuing function is not available for

handover requests and RRC connection

reestablishment requests.

Figure 3 shows the admission policy with three

admission thresholds. The first two characters xx of the threshold

parameter names refer to downlink, uplink, or the CCE MSR group.

Dynamic UE Admission Control Thresholds

## 3.4 Mobile Terminating Access Handling with Dynamic UE Admission Control

If the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature is activated, the

mobile-terminating access requests are included in the admission control

function.

Figure 4 shows the relation between the

thresholds of the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature and the thresholds introduced by

the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature.

Figure 4   Admission Policy with Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

The Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

feature introduces the following paging priority thresholds:

These thresholds are mapped to the thresholds in the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature. If the load in the cell is above the differentiating threshold of the Dynamic

UE Admission Control feature, only mobile-terminating access requests with a priority

that is equal to or higher than the differentiating paging priority threshold are

accepted. If the load is above the overload threshold of the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature, only mobile-terminating access requests with a riority that is equal to

or higher than the overload paging priority threshold are accepted.

## 3.5 Privileged Access

Without the activation of the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

feature, Privileged Access (PA) user requests are always admitted by the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature. When the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature

is activated, PA user requests are rejected in case of overload. Activating the two features

together with the Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature, the PA user requests that are

about to be rejected because of overload, are queued instead.

The following types of requests are considered to be PA:

- RRC Connection Requests with emergency or high priority access establishment cause.
- For handover requests and reestablishments where any of the E-RABs has an Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level equal to or below the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. Call queuing function is not available for handover requests and RRC connection reestablishment requests.
- With the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature activated, the mobile-terminating access requests with paging priority higher than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This threshold is configured by the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute.

## 3.6 High Priority Traffic in Resource Fair Scheduler

For the Resource-Fair scheduler to generate traffic scheduled with high priority, a targeted

maximum allowed time between scheduling occasions of a bearer can be configured. A bearer that

is not scheduled within the specified time, one of the following is given the priority

specified in its corresponding QoS configuration:

- ENodeBFunction.dlMaxWaitingTimeGlobal
- ENodeBFunction.ulMaxWaitingTimeGlobal

The same setting is applied to all QCIs, so it is not possible to set it uniquely for

each QCI.

## 3.7 Interaction between QoS Parameters and Dynamic UE Admission Control

The MSRs reflect how much traffic is scheduled with high priority to meet the configured

QoS requirements. The higher the MSR values, the more problematic it is to fulfill QoS

requirements at all times.

To tune the parameters, it is advised to firstly configure QoS parameters as required,

and then the Dynamic UE Admission Control thresholds.

# 4 Network Impact of Dynamic UE Admission Control

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature improves retainability and mobility KPIs, and

maintains the cell throughput during overload scenarios.

Capacity and Performance

When a cell is starting to become overloaded, then the following can happen:

- There is a slight reduction in the maximum peak throughput compared to when the feature is disabled, so UEs start to get rejected.
- There is an increased number of rejected UEs.

The number of RRC connected UEs is dynamically controlled by the level of scheduler

high-priority traffic load. The maximum number of RRC connected UEs depend on the

current traffic load and RF conditions, and is less than or equal to the licensed or

maximum supported RRC connected UEs for the particular Baseband type.

If the feature is off, then there is a risk that the overload becomes too severe,

with significantly degraded node throughput as a result. This does not happen when

the feature is on and correctly configured. Throughput is maintained at the cost of

UEs being rejected at RRC Connection Requests, RRC

Reestablishment Requests and handovers.

Mobility

It is expected that retainability and mobility KPIs are improved as new incoming

requests are rejected in overloaded scenarios giving priority to existing or already

registered users in the system. It is also expected that accessibility KPI and

throughput for each cell KPIs are impacted, but this is preferred in terms of giving

existing or already connected users a better service experience.

Mobility Success Rate decreases when node is close to maximum capacity.

Key Performance Indicators

The feature is expected to improve retainability and maintain the cell throughput on

an acceptable level during overload scenarios, at the cost of decreased

accessibility and mobility.

Table 3 lists the main KPIs affected by the

Dynamic UE Admission Control feature.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

Configuring the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature is done by setting the thresholds

specified in Dynamic UE Admission Control Thresholds and Parameters.

By configuring the two thresholds correctly, the following different behaviors of the

system can be achieved:

- If handovers and reestablishments are not to be subject to admission control by this feature, then xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr must be set to its maximum value.
- If no reserved area for reestablishments and handovers is required, then If handovers and reestablishments are not subject to admission control by this feature, then xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr must be set to the same value as xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr.
- By properly configuring the reserved area defined by the MSR range from xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr to xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr, retainability for reestablishment and handover users can be configured.

There is a trade-off between the following:

- Maximum peak throughput and accessibility.
- Ability to retain already connected UEs.

For high throughput, xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr must be set

high. This reduces the reserved area and potentially causes establishment and handover

users to be rejected, because of the xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr

threshold.

Conversely, for high retainability,xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr

must be set low. Therefore, more users entering through RRC Connection Request are

rejected.

When the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature is activated and Resource Fair

Scheduling is in operation, then it is highly recommended to configure

MaxWaitingTimeGlobal, for admission control to function as

intended. Therefore, congestion for users using Resource Fair Scheduling is also taken

into account in admission control, otherwise it is not. A bearer that is not scheduled

within MaxWaitingTimeGlobal is prioritized according to its

configured QCI priority, see QoS-Aware Scheduler.

To include the mobile-terminating access requests in the

admission control decisions, the thresholds introduced by the Prioritized Mobile

Terminating Access at High Load feature must be configured.

The following configurations are recommended:

- For the overload paging priority threshold, the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute is configured to the value that is assigned as the paging priority to the privileged access mobile-terminating calls by the MME.
- For the differentiating paging priority threshold, the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityDiffThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityDiffThr attribute is configured to the value that is assigned as the paging priority to the mobile-terminating VoLTE calls by the MME.

Benefits

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature continuously estimates the maximum amount

of dynamic resources needed in downlink for PTT traffic. PTT reservations are

immediately updated when admitting or releasing PTT bearers. By activating the

enhancement, the algorithm of the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature becomes

available for the affected features and function. They become capable for

considering the dynamic PTT downlink MSR reservation at MSR use calculation. The

enhancement ensures the following benefits for the following affected features and

function:

- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature allows only those UEs to be admitted that can be adequately served.
- The Preferential Traffic Management function improves blocking handovers for non-priority UEs and blocking idle mode camping when PTT UEs are present in the eNodeB. This feature is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.
- The Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature improves prioritizing cell resources for RRC connected users if there is high load.
- An attribute is introduced for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature to control the rejection of the privileged access bearer setup requests. Also, improved handover and re-establishment rejection observability is ensured for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control and the Enhanced PTT Admission Control features. Dynamic GBR Admission Control is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.

For more information about the operation of the Enhanced PTT Admission Control

feature and this enhancement, see the following documents:

- Dynamic GBR Admission Control
- Load-Based CA SCell Handling
- Preferential Traffic Management

Capacity and Performance

When the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, it dynamically reserves

resources for PTT users. This can impact the node capacity beside providing stable

performance in high load cases with PTT service active.

Operation

The enhancement introduces three new parameters related to dynamic reservation of

resources for PTT users and resource use for privileged access users.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement can be operated on the following Baseband Units:

- Baseband 5212
- Baseband 5216
- Baseband 6303
- Baseband 6318
- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630
