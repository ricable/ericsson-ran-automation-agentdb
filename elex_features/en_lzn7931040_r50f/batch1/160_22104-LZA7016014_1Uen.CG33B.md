# 1 Admission-Triggered Offload Overview

This feature monitors MSR-based GBR load, which is used for admission control. If the

load is above a threshold, new UEs in connected mode are moved to another

LTE

or to WCDMA frequency.

Summary

The Admission-Triggered Offload feature helps to control the load created by GBR bearers in

LTE cells. The feature offloads the UEs to other LTE frequency or RAT when the GBR

usage of the source cell exceeds the configured

admission-Triggered

Offload threshold. This ensures efficient utilization of

resources

in

the LTE cell and available IRAT resources.

The offload of UEs with GBR bearers is triggered before admission rejection or service

degradation occurs. The underlying trigger mechanism uses MSR to signal if resource

usage exceeds the configured threshold.

The Admission-Triggered Offload feature offers the following benefits:

- Enables more efficient GBR overload handling
- Enables better service quality during degradation for GBR bearers that are already set up in the system
- Improves end-user experience through minimizing the rate of rejections for services that need GBR bearers
- Improves the resource utilization of LTE cells and involved WCDMA cells.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

A UE can be moved by the Admission-Triggered Offload feature if the following

conditions are met:

- For an E-UTRAN frequency, the UE must have the capabilities to support both inter-frequency handover (FGI 13) and A5 measurement (FGI 14).
- For an UTRAN frequency, the UE must have the capabilities to support both UTRAN handover (FGI 8 and 22) and B1 measurement (FGI 15).

Network Requirements

No Network Requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Admission-Triggered Offload

The Admission-Triggered Offload feature controls cell load based on thresholds related

to GBR MSR usage by offloading UEs to other LTE or IRAT frequencies.

Process Steps

1. The MSR usage for GBR bearers is periodically measured and compared with the following Admission-Triggered Offload thresholds on the source eNodeB: AdmissionControl.lbATOThresholdLevel1 AdmissionControl.lbATOThresholdLevel2 It is possible to set two different thresholds based on the bearers QCI that the UE has at the moment. When AdmissionControl.lbATOThresholdLevel1 is reached the feature starts searching and move UEs with a specific QCI only, for example QCI1. When AdmissionControl.lbATOThresholdLevel2 is reached the feature moves UEs with QCIs defined for AdmissionControl.lbATOThresholdLevel1 and AdmissionControl.lbATOThresholdLevel2, for example QCI1 and QCI2. Note: If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the downlink PTT dynamic MSR reservations are considered when checking the admission-triggered offload thresholds.
2. When the MSR usage exceeds any Admission-Triggered Offload threshold, the source eNodeB selects the candidate UEs for Admission-Triggered Offload and configures the A5 or B1 measurement. The choice depends on configuration for this feature. When the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, the following applies: UEs are selected for offload based on the priority of their subscriber group. Up to 12 subscriber groups can be defined. Offload candidate selection works only on cells that reference PRIORITY Preferential Traffic Management cell profiles. The order of the subscriber group offload is defined by the order of the subscriber group references in PtmAtoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef. Groups from the top of the PtmAtoConfig.ptmSubscriverGroupRef list have lower priority and are offloaded earlier. For high priority groups, a special threshold is introduced to control the timing of the Preferential Traffic Management initiated offload. Offload is not stopped due to lack of UEs with low priority SPIDs or which cannot be moved for other reasons, for example emergency call or bad coverage in the target cell. When the Admission-Triggered Offload throughput is evaluated, it is then decided whether the amount of offloaded UEs fulfills the threshold requirements. If not, the next group of UEs are offloaded. Note: Enabling subscriber group-based UE selection for offload requires the following configuration: Priority cells reference cell profiles where PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY. PtmFunction.ptmEnabled is set to TRUE. For more information, see Preferential Traffic Management Guidelines. Figure 1 Frequency Filter for Admission-Triggered Offload In the UE selection process, the UE measures the E-UTRAN or UTRAN target frequency using the A5 measurement or B1 measurement report. Only such a UE is selected that supports the target frequency band and triggers A5 measurement or B1 measurement report on the target cell. The source cell Main Processor load condition and frequency filter rules are considered as follows: Handover to a target cell is inhibited, if the source cell Main Processor load state is high. If an HRL is provided for the UE, it prevents UE selection to forbidden target E-UTRAN or UTRAN cells. Admission-Triggered Offload to a target cell is inhibited for a UE if either of the two parameters for the concerned target carrier frequency, FreqPrioEUTRA.atoAllowed or FreqPrioUTRA.atoAllowed, is set to FALSE for the matching UE SPID. Otherwise, if set to TRUE or there is no matching UE SPID, the Admission-Triggered Offload towards a target cell for the UE is allowed. See Subscriber Triggered Mobility for details on the support of SPID use. QCI-dependent UE selection criteria can be configured for the individual E-UTRAN and UTRAN frequencies, if the Service Specific Load Management feature is activated. For more information, see Service Specific Load Management.

4. The node evaluates the A5 measurement or B1 measurement report when received from the UE. Table 2 Thresholds Checked at Receiving Measurement Report Event Threshold Description A5 measurement inter-frequency ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold1Rsrp ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqLb.a5Threshold2Rsrp ReportConfigA5.a5Threshold1Rsrq ReportConfigA5.a5Threshold2Rsrq If an A5 measurement report is received, the node checks whether the reported values for RSRQ and RSRP are above the relevant thresholds. For more information, see Inter-Frequency Load Balancing. B1 measurement IRAT ReportConfigInterRatLb.utranB1ThresholdEcNo ReportConfigInterRatLb.utranB1ThresholdRscp If an B1 measurement report is received, the node checks whether the reported quantity is good enough and above the configured thresholds. See Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA for more details. Note: If the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is active and there are restrictions on Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk service in the GERAN and UTRAN networks, mobility towards these networks is prevented
5. The node initiates X2 or S1 handover to intra-LTE or WCDMA according to the target frequency. The handover is performed using the normal inter-frequency handover procedures, as follows: X2 Handover Preparation S1 Handover Preparation RRC Connection Reconfiguration The following conditions are considered for handover: If a HRL is provided for the UE, it prevents UE selection to forbidden target E-UTRAN or UTRAN cell. See Shared LTE RAN for details on HRL support. Handover to a target cell is inhibited if either of the two attributes EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed or UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed is set to FALSE, or mobilityStatus.available is set to FALSE in either the EUtranCellRelation or the UtranCellRelation MO. The handover cause value is set according to either of the two attributes LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1SourceTriggersOffload or LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeX2SourceTriggersOffload.

## 3.1 Monitored System Resources

RBS considers its MSRs to decide if it can admit a request or not, see Figure 2. Each MSR represents the utilization of a

system resource that potentially is a bottleneck in the RBS. Moreover, the MSR represents the

accumulated resource utilization from all admitted requests.

Figure 2   Admission Control Checks the MSRs

The MSRs can be either static or dynamic, see Figure 3. Requests can be admitted (indicated as up)

and released (indicated as down). The resource consumption to a static MSR because of an

admitted request does not vary during the time the request is served by the RBS. The resource

consumption changes if a specific modification request, for example an E-RAB Modify Request on

S1AP, is issued. The resource consumption to a dynamic MSR because of an admitted request can

vary during the time the request is served by the RBS. The variations depend on the scheduler,

radio conditions, or mobility.

Consideration of dynamic MSRs for GBR traffic is part of the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature and protects QoS of already

admitted E-RABs.

Figure 3   Static versus Dynamic MSRs

# 4 Network Impact of Admission-Triggered Offload

More handovers are performed due to redistributing LTE users to other LTE or WCDMA

cells. Service quality and network capacity improves as the Admission-Triggered Offload

feature enables better utilization of LTE and WCDMA cells.

Capacity and Performance

The Admission-Triggered Offload feature enables better utilization of LTE and WCDMA

cells by offloading UEs which have GBR bearer load. Therefore service quality and

network capacity are improved.

Mobility

The Admission-Triggered Offload feature redistributes LTE users to other LTE or WCDMA

cells by monitoring the GBR resource usage. Therefore, more handovers are performed

due to the Admission-Triggered Offload feature. The Mobility KPI is not affected

because the counter values for the Admission-Triggered Offload feature related

handovers are subtracted from the KPI formula.

# 5 Parameters for Admission-Triggered Offload

The feature introduces new MOM attributes for configuration and uses already existing

attributes in load management for A5 measurement and B1 measurement handling and for

handover handling.

Table 3   Parameters

# 6 Performance of Admission-Triggered Offload

The Admission-Triggered Offload feature is associated with performance management

entities measuring handover capabilities.

# 7 Activate Admission-Triggered Offload

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011814 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Admission-Triggered Offload

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011814 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Admission-Triggered Offload

Admission-Triggered Offload feature can be enabled in a cell for frequency relation,

per SPID in all cells on a node, or per cell per SPID.

Enabling Admission-Triggered Offload in a Cell

Admission-Triggered Offload can be enabled in a cell for a frequency relation, by

setting EUtranFreqRelation.atoAllowed to

TRUE for E-UTRAN frequencies, and setting

UtranFreqRelation.atoAllowed to TRUE for

UTRAN frequencies.

Enabling Admission-Triggered Offload per SPID

Admission-Triggered Offload can be allowed in cells on one node for frequency

relations for UEs with certain SPIDs-configured in MO attribute

RATFreqPrio.spidList.

Admission-triggered offload is allowed to E-UTRAN frequencies, if the corresponding

FreqPrioEUTRA.atoAllowed attribute is set to

TRUE.

Admission-triggered offload is allowed to UTRAN frequencies, if the corresponding

FreqPrioUTRAN.atoAllowed attribute is set to

TRUE.

Enabling Admission-Triggered

Offload

If Preferential Traffic Management is used, Admission-Triggered Offload can

be

enabled by setting

PtmCellProfile.cellType

to

PRIORITY,

and disabled by setting it

NON\_PRIORITY.

Enabling Admission-Triggered Offload per QCI

The value of

PtmCellProfile.cellType

is

checked.

If it is set to

PRIORITY,

the thresholds for Admission-Triggered

Offload-AdmissionControl.lbAtoThresholdLevel1 and

AdmissionControl.lbAtoThresholdLevel2-are signaled with the

values configured in MOM.

Otherwise, the following threshold values are used:

- AdmissionControl.lbAtoThresholdLevel1 = 100
- AdmissionControl.lbAtoThresholdLevel2 = 100
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resMsrUsageThreshold = 100
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresMsrUsageThreshold = 100

Example 1 shows an example where

the Admission-Triggered Offload is configured to perform handover for UEs with QCI1

when AdmissionControl.lbAtoThresholdLevel1 is reached. When

AdmissionControl.lbAtoThresholdLevel2 is reached, the

handover is performed for UEs with QCI2.

Example 1   Enabling Admission-Triggered Offload per

QCI

The frequency-earfcn parameter value 3590 is allowed to

Admission-Triggered Offload handover by UE with QCI1 for Admission-Triggered Offload

threshold level 1 and UE with QCI1 and QCI2 for Admission-Triggered Offload

threshold level 2, lbA5Threshold2RsrpOffset for QCI1 (Struct[0])

to 2 for Admission-Triggered Offload and lbA5Threshold2RsrpOffset

for QCI2 (Struct[1]) to 1 for Admission-Triggered Offload. QCI3 and QCI4 are not

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q1: Preferential Traffic Management

The Preferential Traffic Management solution enables the operator to control user access

to priority and non-priority bands. With Preferential Traffic Management, it is possible to

define up to 12 subscriber groups denoted by a list of SPIDs and PLMN with different

selection priority for Inter-Frequency Offload and Admission-Triggered Offload.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | 20/FAJ 121 1447                         |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node      |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

The Preferential Traffic Management solution offers the operator the possibility to efficiently

use an LTE network, deployed on several frequency bands, with one frequency band used

primarily for priority users. The solution enables the following:

- To use the priority band for both priority and non-priority users as long as co-existence rules allow it.
- To use the priority band exclusively for priority users in the intended traffic situations.
- To use the non-priority bands for both non-priority and priority users, both as coverage bands and bands to offload priority traffic when the priority band is overloaded.
- To define how Preferential Traffic Management functions treat specific UEs by using subscriber groups.

The load management policies used depend on the current traffic load level. Traffic load

states in the solution are defined by configurable load threshold parameters.

The solution is developed for existing commercial RAN infrastructure with a designated

band used as priority band, using an MOCN architecture. The solution is achieved by a

collection of extensions in existing licensed features, configured to work together.

For more detailed information on Preferential Traffic Management, see Preferential Traffic Management

Guidelines.

Capacity and Performance

The capacity on priority bands is limited for non-priority users and changes with network

congestion level. This is because of the need to provide uninterrupted connectivity

for priority users. During network congestion, an increased drop in mobility success

rate towards priority cells is expected.

Operation

The Preferential Traffic Management solution is activated on node level using the

PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute.

On the eNodeB, a maximum of four cell profiles can be configured, but a cell refers

to only one predefined profile. This controls which Preferential Traffic Management

actions are triggered on the cell. Each cell profile can be configured using the

PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute with the following

settings:

- PRIORITY
- NON\_PRIORITY

UE selection for Admission-Triggered Offload and Inter-Frequency Offload works only

if the PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute is set to

PRIORITY.

The function introduces the following new MO classes:

- PtmAtoConfig
- PtmCellProfile
- PtmFunction
- PtmIflbConfig
- PtmIfoConfig
- PtmResOpUseConfig
- PtmStmConfig
- PtmSubscriberGroup

This function is controlled by the following new parameters:

- PtmAtoConfig.minSuccRateThreshold
- PtmAtoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmCellProfile.cellType
- PtmFunction.ptmEnabled
- PtmIflbConfig.stopIncomingIflbThreshold
- PtmIflbConfig.stopOutgoingIflbEnabled
- PtmIfoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resSRatioThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresSRatioThreshold
- PtmStmConfig.inhibitImpInterval
- PtmStmConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmSubscriberGroup.plmn
- PtmSubscriberGroup.spidList

Handover of UEs with certain PLMN IDs and SPID to a

target cell can be blocked. This occurs when the PLMN ID of the UE is "reserved for

operator use" in the target cell. It can be reserved, because the priority cell has

a very high traffic load-subscription ratio or MSR usage. It is also required that

the SPID of the UE is configured in the PtmSubscriberGroup MO as

the PtmStmConfig MO refers to that group.

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement enhances accessibility for priority UEs as part of the

Preferential Traffic Management solution. It enables priority UEs that utilize

non-priority equivalent home PLMN to connect to priority bands and to fully utilize

priority cell resources under the following circumstances:

- The priority cells are in a high traffic load.
- The priority PLMN core network is not available due to S1-C connection failure.

Capacity and Performance

This system improvement can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedSubRatio
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedSubRatio

Operation

This system improvement introduces the

PtmResOpUseConfig.suspResOpUsePlmnList attribute. This

attribute can suspend dynamic PLMN reservation during S1-C connection failure. The

operator can select priority PLMNs for which the cell reservation is suspended.

If the PtmResOpUseConfig.suspResOpUsePlmnList attribute is empty,

which is the default value, any of the priority PLMNs can suspend dynamic PLMN

reservation for cells during S1-C connection failure.

This system improvement introduces the following PM events:
