# 1 Service Specific Inactivity Timer Overview

The Service Specific Inactivity Timer feature enables the extension of the UE

inactivity timer for each QCI. The UE is kept in connected mode longer to give VoLTE or PTT

voice more time to answer a call before it is dropped due to inactivity.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4246                                             |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

When a VoLTE or PTT call is made, the alert phase is often longer than it is for a

regular call. If the UE inactivity timer times out during this alert phase, the UE

becomes idle and the call is dropped. To avoid dropping the call, the Service

Specific Inactivity Timer feature enables the extension of the expiration time for

the existing UE inactivity timer.

Different time values can be configured for different QCIs to mach their respective

needs.

With this feature activated, it is possible to prevent dropping a call even if the UE

takes too much time to answer.

# 2 Dependencies of Service Specific Inactivity Timer

The feature is related to another feature differentiating between QCIs.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

# 3 Feature Operation of Service Specific Inactivity Timer

The feature enables operators to extend the expiration time of the UE inactivity timer

by configuring different time offset values for different QCIs.

The feature extends the expiration time of the inactivity timer for UEs with an active QCI 1

bearer for VoLTE calls according to GSMA IR.92. As a result, the UE is kept in connected mode

longer and a ringing VoLTE UE stays connected to the LTE cell to answer the call.

The offset values of the affected QCIs are configured with the following attributes:

- QciProfilePredefined.inactivityTimerOffset
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.inactivityTimerOffset

The configuration extends the inactivity timer value set by the

Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute, which is configured on the node

level.

## 3.1 Process Steps

To extend the inactivity timer for a UE, the

QciProfilePredefined.inactivityTimerOffset or the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.inactivityTimerOffset attribute needs to be set

to a value higher than 0.

The value of the total inactivity timer is calculated from the sum of the

Rcs.tInactivityTimer and the highest value of the

QciProfilePredefined.inactivityTimerOffset or the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.inactivityTimerOffset attribute.

The extended expiration time is updated at the following procedures:

- E-RAB setup
- E-RAB modify
- E-RAB release
- InitialContextSetup
- S1 and X2 Handover
- At Path Switch Request Acknowledge that is successfully performed

When the status of a UE changes from inactive to active, the UE inactivity timer resets to

the total inactivity timer value.

# 4 Network Impact of Service Specific Inactivity Timer

The feature can affect retainability and mobility.

Capacity and Performance

The feature can decrease retainability and mobility on the node level, if the

Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute is set to a high value.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Service Specific Inactivity Timer

The feature introduces parameters related to prolonging the default inactivity

timer.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                                       | Type       | Description                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QciProfileOperatorDefined.inactivityTimerOffset | Introduced | See MOM description.  A value of 0 means that this parameter is not used. |
| QciProfilePredefined.inactivityTimerOffset      | Introduced | See MOM description.  A value of 0 means that this parameter is not used. |

# 6 Performance of Service Specific Inactivity Timer

The feature can decrease the node retainability and mobility KPIs. The feature is

associated with counters related to extended inactivity time.

KPIs

The table lists the main KPIs associated with the feature, and the expected

impact.

Table 3   Key Performance Indicators

| KPI           | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retainability | When the Service Specific Inactivity timer feature is activated,                                     the node retainability rate can decrease. |
| Mobility      | When the Service Specific Inactivity timer feature is activated,                                     the node mobility rate can decrease.      |
