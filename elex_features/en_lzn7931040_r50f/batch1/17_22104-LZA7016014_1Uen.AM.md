Summary

The CPRI Link Observability feature improves the observability of LTE RAN, WCDMA RAN, and GSM

RAN. The feature is applicable for both electrical and optical links and includes

the following functions:

- Fault detection
- Fault localization
- Fault isolation
- Alarm handling to CPRI links and SFP modules

The main benefits of the CPRI Link Observability feature are as follows:

- Identifies the equipment used in the network.
- Improves the fault management process, and speeds up investigation.
- Helps to avoid unnecessary hardware returns to the manufacturer of radio units and Baseband units. Monitors and reports the quality and performance of CPRI links through metrics.
- Reduces CPRI link-related downtime.

The feature simplifies the collection of information needed for troubleshooting CPRI

link issues in the field. The information collection is simplified with the

following:

- Adding inventory support for SFP modules
- Enhancing CPRI fault handling
- Adding CPRI-related performance data (CPRI PM counters)

# 2 Dependencies of CPRI Link Observability

The CPRI Link Observability feature is supported only the Baseband Radio

Node.

Feature Dependencies

The feature has no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

The feature has the following hardware limitations:

- CPRI Link Observability is not supported for IDL/IDL2/IDL-2 connections. PM counters reported for such RiLinks are not valid for use.
- CPRI Link Observability is not supported on non-Ericsson radios that do not have CPRI monitoring capability.

Limitations

The feature has no limitations.

Network Requirements

The feature has no network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of CPRI Link Observability

The CPRI Link Observability feature uses inventory information, CPRI-related fault

reporting, and counters for failure detection.

Inventory Information

The inventory information is available in the MOM for all installed SFP modules.

There is no need to execute Ericsson CLI commands in the field or collect logs

through scripts. The data is updated as SFP modules are inserted and removed. The

provided inventory information also identifies whether a particular SFP module is

certified for use by Ericsson. SFP modules certified by Ericsson provide associated

Ericsson product data, for example, RDH number. Not certified SFP modules, or for

which the data cannot be read, are identified as "non-Ericsson".

Fault Isolation

The CPRI Link Observability feature modifies fault reporting related to CPRI links

and ports. To avoid unnecessary hardware returns, the CPRI-related fault isolation

is enhanced so that specific CPRI faults are reported on the corresponding

equipment. For example, if a specific CPRI link or SFP module is faulty, an alarm is

raised on that link or module and not on the Baseband unit. Stability

conditions of the link or module can also be detected and reported.

The feature improves the level of information contained in CPRI link and SFP-related

faults, which provide more clear operator procedures for CPRI-related alarms.

For

Baseband Radio Nodes, specific alarms are added for faults that are related to the

SFP modules.

Counters

Figure 1 shows an

example of laser failure detection with the CPRI Link Observability feature on LTE.

The CPRI Link Observability feature give SFP stability warnings before link failure

occur. The counter data also indicates laser degradation over a long period as

follows: The counters provided for CPRI Link Observability feature are used to

monitor, compare, and troubleshoot various CPRI- and equipment-related items in a

configuration.

- The pmSfpTxBias PM counter shows the increasing bias current.
- The pmSfpTemperature PM counter shows stable temperature for the same period.

Preventive maintenance based on counter data can avoid the link failure.

Events

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for CPRI Link Observability

## 8.1 Baseband R Support, LTE Only

The CPRI Link Observability feature is available for Baseband R in the LTE RAN. PM counters

are available on the SfpModule and SfpChannel MOs for

the Baseband R. The counters monitor the SFP inventory and performance data for SFPs installed

on Baseband R, and SFP faults.

Figure 4 shows an example of a connection with

Baseband R on the CPRI links and ports.
