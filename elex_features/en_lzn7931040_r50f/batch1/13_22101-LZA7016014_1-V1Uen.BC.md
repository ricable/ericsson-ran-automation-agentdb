# 1 Mixed Mode Radio Node LTE Identity

# 2 Benefits of Mixed Mode Radio Node LTE

The features included in the Mixed Mode Radio Node LTE value package maximize

hardware use between multiple radio standards. This is achieved by sharing RBS 6000 Support

Systems, or

Baseband

units, antenna feeders and antennas.

The features included in the Mixed Mode Radio Node LTE value package provide the

following benefits

on

the site:

- Power consumption is reduced.
- Footprint is reduced.
- The load on structures is reduced.
- The operational costs are reduced.
- Traffic migration from one standard to another can be done without site visits.
- A site can be hardware-prepared for a standard that is remotely activated at a later stage.
- LTE deployment is cost efficient in multistandard networks.

Summary

The main benefit of the Mixed Mode Radio feature is that radio units can be shared

between two nodes of the same or different radio standards. The Mixed Mode Radio

feature improves the flexibility of existing and new RBS installations. The costs

associated with running different radio standards in the same frequency band are

minimized.

Additional Information

Mixed Mode Radio combinations are maintained as a whole. This means that the software

and hardware used for Mixed Mode Radio must be compatible. Both the node software

level and the radio software level must match the radio unit in use. For specific

compatibility information, see the appropriate radio unit description, the release

notes for the relevant software version, and Radio Node Configurations.

For the summary of Mixed Mode Radio feature enhancements, see Feature Change History of Mixed Mode Radio.

For more information about this feature and related topics, see 3GPP TS 37.104,

NR, E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE; Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Station (BS)

radio transmission and reception.

## 3.2 Mixed Mode Baseband Overview

The Mixed Mode Baseband feature allows multi-standard operation within a single RAN

Compute unit.

Summary

This feature provides the possibility to add an additional RAT without the need to

install additional Baseband hardware. This feature also allows efficient use of the

Baseband hardware for sites with medium requirements on Baseband capacity. This

feature allows flexible multi-standard configuration, adding or replacing standards

for the desired combination, even without site visits. Efficient use of RAN Compute

hardware for sites with medium requirements on RAN Compute capacity.

Both FDD and TDD for LTE and NR are supported.

Hardware reconfiguration is not required to divide the physical resources, as the

Baseband Radio Node detects which sector carriers or TRXs are configured in the

system, and configures itself accordingly.
