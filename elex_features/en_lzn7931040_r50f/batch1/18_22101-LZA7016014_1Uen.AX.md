# 1 Frequency Synchronization Identity

| Value Package Identity   | FAJ 801 0414   |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Introduced in            | L17.Q2         |

# 2 Benefits of Frequency Synchronization

The Frequency Synchronization value package offers extended robustness of the time

and phase synchronization solution and more accurate synchronization without the need of

additional hardware at the cell site or any hardware dependencies in the

backhaul.

The features included in the Frequency Synchronization value package have the following

benefits:

- No hardware dependencies in the backhaul. A synchronization server is required in the network, which can serve multiple RBSs.
- Usable in multi-vendor and multi-RAN networks
- Reduced training time and planning time, because PTP is a common protocol in multi-vendor networks
- No additional hardware needed at the cell site
- Extends the robustness of the time and phase synchronization solution when using IEEE 1588 through SyncE
- Synchronization accuracy is independent of backhaul network load when SyncE is used

# 3 Frequency Synchronization Business Values

OPEX Reduction: ReducedTtraining

PTP is a common protocol in multi-vendor networks.

Training about the protocol itself and the tools support planning. Thus operations of

the synchronization solution can be reduced.

CAPEX Reduction: Only A Software Upgrade Is Needed at the Cell Site

No additional hardware needed at the cell site.

In contrast to other synchronization solutions, such as GPS, no additional hardware

is needed on site to deploy PTP for frequency synchronization or to deploy

SyncE.

PTP for frequency synchronization has the advantage that it requires no support

across the backhaul. A synchronization server is required in the network, but that

can serve many RBSs.

# 4 Included Functions

## 4.1 IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization Overview
