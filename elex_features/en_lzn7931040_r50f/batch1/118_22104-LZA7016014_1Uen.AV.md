Summary

The PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature provides tools to configure and run UE

measurements according to 3GPP specifications. From these UE measurements, the

operator can collect information required to monitor and fine-tune UE behavior in

the network.

UE measurements are configured for each cell. All UEs within a cell have the same

measurement configuration. The start and stop of UE measurements are controlled

using the OSS.

For example, mobility measurements can be fine-tuned without changing the actual

configuration of the mobility measurements and without disturbing normal traffic

behavior. Using PM counters, statistics can be gathered about the radio environment

and UE behavior can be observed within a specific cell.

This feature enables the configuration of two separate intra-frequency E-UTRA

measurements, inter-frequency E-UTRA measurements, or both. It also supports the

configuration of separate inter-RAT measurements for UTRA or GERAN. A total of six

measurements can be configured.

The UE measurement is started by including at least one specific PM event in a Cell

Trace or UE Trace Subscription Profile. The information from the measurements is

available in the form of PM events and PM counters.

The PM counters are connected to one of the PM events, and are referred to as RES

counters. The counters for individual cells provide statistical results of the

PM-initiated UE measurements in those cells.

# 2 Dependencies of PM-Initiated UE Measurements

The feature is related to session continuity features because it is possible to

configure different measurements for different frequencies and different

RATs.

Network Requirements

The following UE capabilities are prerequisites for PM-Initiated UE Measurements

depending on measurement configuration:

- Feature Group Indicator 14: Measurement reporting A4 measurement and Measurement reporting A5 measurement.
- Feature Group Indicator 15: Measurement reporting B1 measurement.
- Feature Group Indicator 16: Periodical measurement reporting for non-automated neighbor relations measurements.
- Feature Group Indicator 23: IRAT GERAN measurements and reporting B2 measurement in E-UTRA connected mode.Feature Group Indicator 22: IRAT UTRAN measurements and reporting B2 measurement in E-UTRA connected mode.
- Feature Group Indicator 25: Inter-frequency measurements and reporting in E-UTRA connected mode.
- Feature Group Indicator 39: IRAT UTRAN TDD measurements and reporting event B2 in E-UTRA connected mode.
- Feature Group Indicator 111: Measurement reporting A6 measurement. Refer to 3GPP TS 36.331 for further information about measurements.

# 3 Feature Operation of PM-Initiated UE Measurements

Before using PM-Initiated UE Measurements, the MO parameters must be configured for the

feature.

A UE measurement configuration consists of two fundamental components:

- A measurement object
- A report configuration

For further details about these components, refer to 3GPP TS

36.331.

Configuring PM-Initiated UE Measurements is done using the MOM. The two measurements for

E-UTRA, UTRA, or GERAN are represented by two MO attributes. Each attribute points to

two MOs representing the measurement object and the report configuration. Before

initiating UE measurements, the attributes must specify the configuration of each E-UTRA

measurement, the measurement object, and the report configuration.

When applicable MOs have been configured, the operator initiates the measurements in the

OSS by including the applicable PM events (see Events Associated with the Operation of the Feature) in a

Cell Trace or UE Trace Subscription Profile.

The following figure provides an overview of how PM-Initiated UE Measurements are used in

the network:

Figure 1   Using PM-Initiated UE Measurements in Network

Cell Trace and UE Trace Subscription Profiles

1. The RBS configures the UE to perform the measurement, which includes creating new MOs for PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq1 and PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq1 attributes.
2. The event job scanner containing the UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ and the UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ events under the PM-Initiated UE Measurements is activated.
3. The UE reports the results to the RBS Note: The information from the measurement reports can then be retrieved from the PM events in the Cell Trace or UE Trace ROP file.
4. UE measurements are terminated when all profiles that include the specific PM event are deactivated.

When using a Cell Trace Subscription Profile, the RBS (depending on UE fraction for

the profile) initiates UE measurements on one or more user equipment. To avoid

affecting or disturbing ordinary traffic, the RBS does not initiate all UE

measurements at once in a specific cell. The RBS initiates UE measurements with

periodicity of 1 second in each cell.

As long as there are measurements to start (consider a queue of UE measurements), the

RBS initiates one measurement per second in each cell. This also applies when

PM-Initiated UE Measurements are terminated.

Timing of UE Measurements

When the RBS sends the measurement configuration to the UE, that configuration is

used for a particular UE until the measurement is ended. When the operator changes

the MOM configuration at time T1 after activating a Cell Trace Subscription Profile

(including applicable PM events), measurements initiated after time T1 obtain the

new MOM configuration. UE measurements initiated before time T1 continue with the

old MOM configuration. Once the UE measurement configuration is sent to the UE, that

configuration is not changed if the operator changes the MOM configuration

later.

RES Counters

The RES counters are connected to one of the PM-Initiated UE Measurements, which is

represented by PM event UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ1,

UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ1, UE\_MEAS\_GERAN1,

UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN1, or all. These counters give a statistical

result of the UE measurement reports. To receive statistical information, the PM

Initiated UE Measurement connected to that specific configuration must be initiated.

The RES counters are reset after each ROP period.

To ensure that RES counters contain statistics for only one MOM configuration in each

ROP period, RES counters show statistics based on the MOM configuration available at

the beginning of the specific ROP period.

One example is a scenario in which the Cell Trace Subscription Profile (including

applicable PM event) is activated together with the RES counters at time T0, in ROP

period R0 and with the MOM configuration C0.

At time T1 (in ROP R0) the operator changes the MOM configuration to C1. After time

T1 some UE may run with configuration C0 and some UE may run with configuration

C1.

At end of ROP R0, the RES counters only contain statistics for configuration C0. The

MOM configuration remains unchanged during ROP R1 (some UE may still run with

configuration C0 and some UE may run with configuration C1). At end of ROP R1, the

RES counters only contain statistics for configuration C1.

PM-Initiated UE Measurements at Handover

At handover, PM-Initiated UE Measurements run with the configuration present in the

target cell. Consider a UE running PM-Initiated UE Measurements in source cell and

then performs a handover to a cell in which has no PM-Initiated UE Measurements

configured. The specific UE measurements are ended during the handover. In case of

UE Trace, if the same UE later returns to the previous cell, the PM-Initiated UE

Measurements are initiated after successful handover. At Cell Trace however, no

guarantee exists that the UE is included in the set of initiated UE measurements in

that cell.

Observation of Measurement Results

The measurement results are observed in the specific PM events and counters.

# 4 Network Impact of PM-Initiated UE Measurements

This section describes how the PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature has an impact on

network functions and

capabilities.

Capacity and Performance

Since using PM-Initiated UE Measurements generates RRC signaling between the RBS and

the UE, it increases the load on the Uu interface. The load is increased when UE

measurements are initiated and terminated, and when the UE sends measurement reports

to the RBS.

When using this feature, every incoming measurement report from a UE generates a PM

event and increases the load in the RBS:

- UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ1
- UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ2
- UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ1
- UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ2
- UE\_MEAS\_GERAN1
- UE\_MEAS\_GERAN2
- UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN1
- UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN2

The increasing number of PM events also increases the load on the transport network

when they are transmitted to the OSS.

Methods to reduce the load when using PM-Initiated UE Measurements include the

following:

- When using Cell Trace, it is recommended that the UE Fraction is set to a suitable value.
- When using UE Trace, Ericsson recommends that the trace depth is set to a suitable value.
- Using periodical measurement configurations and using only one of the two PM-Initiated UE Measurements are also means for reducing the load on transport network, Uu interface, and RBS.
- When configuring periodical measurements, consider the periodicity if there are performance or capacity issues.

It is important that the PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature is configured and used

carefully to minimize impact on the following network elements:

| Throughput and latency   |    | Increases in uplink RRC signaling can decrease throughput and increase                             latency (RRC signaling has scheduling priority over user data).                             Measurement gaps can also decrease throughput and increase latency.                                              |
|--------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Retainability            |    | An increased number of dropped calls can be expected when this feature is                             in use. The added signaling can impact retainability.                                                                                                                                                     |
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Mobility performance     |    | If the UE is configured to transmit large measurement reports with high                             frequency, RRC signaling increases significantly and may have an impact                             on UE measurements used for mobility. Mobility performance can be                             affected. |
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| UE battery performance   |    | Each UE measurement requires processing power in the UE. Each UE                             measurement reduces the UE battery performance.                                                                                                                                                                    |

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for PM-Initiated UE Measurements

The following figures show how PM-Initiated UE Measurements can be configured for one

cell:

Figure 2   Configuring PM-Initiated Intra-Frequency UE Measurements in Cell

Figure 3   Configuring PM-Initiated Inter-Frequency UE Measurements in Cell

Figure 4   Configuring PM-Initiated Inter-RAT UE Measurements in Cell

An overview of the configuration process is given in the following table:

Table 6   Overview of PM Initiated Configuration Process

|   Stage | Description                      |
|---------|----------------------------------|
|       1 | Measurements are configured.     |
|       2 | Measurements are initiated.      |
|       3 | Statistics are collected.        |
|       4 | Measurements are deactivated.    |
|       5 | Measurement results are observed |

Each stage of the process is described in detail in the following sections.

## 9.1 Configuration of Measurements

The operator starts by creating and configuring the MO

ReportConfigEUtraIntraFreqPm or

ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqPm, ReportConfigInterRatPm,

or all. Up to six instances can be created, and up to two instances can be activated, per

cell. If not already created, the operator creates and configures the MO

EUtranFrequency. This MO denotes the measurement object.

Intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT measurements are supported. This means that

the EUtranFrequency MO (to which PmUeMeasControl MO is

pointing) must be configured.

The EUtranFreqRelation, UtranFreqRelation, or

GeranFreqGroupRelation MO enables the RBS to order measurements on a

particular frequency and must be manually created at configuration.

If more than two measurements are configured, two of them are selected in the following order:

1. EUTRAN measurements have higher priority than IRAT.
2. Measurements that step PM counters have higher priority than measurements that do not step PM counters.
3. Intra-frequency measurements have higher priority than inter-frequency measurements.

Intra-frequency Measurements

To connect the Report Configuration and the Measurement Object for intra-frequency

measurements the operator has to take the following actions:

1. Create the MO PmUeMeasControl.
2. Set the attributes PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq1 or PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq2, or both to point to the created ReportConfigEUtraIntraFreqPm MOs and EUtranFrequency MO.

For intra-frequency measurements, if both PM-Initiated UE Measurements

(PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq1 and

PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq2) in a specific cell have the same

configuration, two similar measurements are started in the applicable UE.

Inter-frequency Measurements

To connect the Report Configuration and the Measurement Object for inter-frequency

measurements the operator has to take the following actions:

1. Create the MO PmUeMeasControl.
2. Set the attributes PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq1 or PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq2, or both to point to the created ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqPm MOs and EUtranFrequency MO.

For inter-frequency measurements, if both PM-Initiated UE Measurements

(PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq1 and

PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq2) in a specific cell have the same

configuration, two similar measurements are started in the applicable UE.

Inter-RAT Measurements

To connect the Report Configuration and the Measurement Object for inter-frequency

measurements the operator has to take the following actions:

1. Create the MO PmUeMeasControl.
2. Set the attributes PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat1 or PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat2, or both to point to the created ReportConfigInterRatPm MOs and UtranFrequency or GeranFrequency, or both MOs.

For inter-RAT measurements, if both PM-Initiated UE Measurements

(PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat1 and

PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat2) in a specific cell have the same

configuration, two similar measurements are started in the applicable UE.

## 9.2 Initiation of Measurements

When required configuration is complete, the measurements are ready to be initiated. The

initiation is done by including one of the following PM events or all of them in a Cell Trace

Subscription Profile and then activating the profile:

- UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ1
- UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ1
- UE\_MEAS\_GERAN1
- UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN1

Alternatively the initiation is done by including one of the following PM events or all of

them in a Cell or UE Trace Subscription Profile and then activating the profile:

- UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ2
- UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ2
- UE\_MEAS\_GERAN2
- UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN2

When creating the User Equipment Traffic Recording (UETR) profile with depth Maximum (trace

depth two), the following measurements are shown in the UETR data:

- PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq2
- PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq2
- UE\_MEAS\_GERAN2
- UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN2

Table 7 shows how PM events correspond to the

configuration of attributes.

Table 7   PM Event and Attribute Configuration

| PM Event           | Corresponding Configuration of Attribute   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| UE_MEAS_INTRAFREQ1 | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq1           |
| UE_MEAS_INTRAFREQ2 | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq2           |
| UE_MEAS_INTERFREQ1 | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq1           |
| UE_MEAS_INTERFREQ2 | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq2           |
| UE_MEAS_GERAN1     | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat1            |
| UE_MEAS_UTRAN1     | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat1            |
| UE_MEAS_GERAN2     | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat2            |
| UE_MEAS_UTRAN2     | PmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat2            |

## 9.3 Collection of Statistics

To collect statistics, the RES counters must be activated by setting up a Statistical

Subscription Profile containing the counters. In addition to the profile,

UE\_MEAS\_INTRAFREQ1 or UE\_MEAS\_INTERFREQ1 or

UE\_MEAS\_GERAN1 or UE\_MEAS\_UTRAN1, or all, must be

configured and initiated to receive statistical information from the RES counters.

## 9.4 Disabling Inter-Frequency and IRAT Measurements Based on ASGH

Inter-frequency and IRAT measurements triggered by the PM-Initiated UE Measurements

feature can be disabled in a subscriber group for downlink and uplink UE throughput

improvement.

If the UE is in a subscriber group, the inter-frequency and IRAT measurements with

measurement gap triggered by the PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature can be

disabled.

For disabling the measurements, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute must

include the value that corresponds the PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature name.

With the disabled inter-frequency and IRAT measurements, the downlink and uplink

throughput improves for the UE. However, the collected measurement reports might be

insufficient.

## 9.5 Deactivation of Measurement Collection

To stop measurement collection, the specific Cell Trace and UE Trace Subscription Profile

must be deactivated.

Upon deactivation of UE measurements, the RBS reconfigures the

UE through the RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure. Incoming

measurement reports are handled by the RBS which generates applicable

PM events and stores them in an ROP file. Statistical data is stored

in a corresponding XML file.

## 9.6 Incorrect or Adverse Behavior

The following adverse behaviors can be observed with the corresponding PM events:

- If the PM-Initiated UE Measurements are initiated without having the feature license, the PM event UE\_MEAS\_EVENT\_FEAT\_NOT\_AVAIL appears in the applicable ROP file.
- If the PM-Initiated UE Measurements are initiated without having performed necessary MOM configuration, the PM event UE\_MEAS\_EVENT\_NOT\_CONFIG appears in the applicable ROP file.
- If the MOM configuration is available at the time of initiation of the PM-Initiated UE Measurements but then removed while there still are measurements in the queue, the PM event UE\_MEAS\_EVENT\_NOT\_CONFIG appears once in the applicable ROP file and the queue of measurements are emptied.
- When the RBS is about to initiate UE measurements towards the UE, the PM event INTERNAL\_EVENT\_UE\_MEAS\_FAILURE can appear in the applicable ROP file if the UE measurement is rejected by either the RBS or the UE. One of the reasons that the RBS rejects a certain measurement can be that the UE is not capable of performing the specific measurement.
