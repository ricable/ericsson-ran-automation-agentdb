Summary

The 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity enables the operator to allocate 5+5 MHz sector carrier

capacity units depending on the requirement of the operator. This provides a more flexible

capacity licensing capability to the node with an increased number of cells.

# 2 Dependencies of 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity has no dependencies to other features, but can limit the size of the

node. This limitation can effect other features.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

There are no special hardware requirements for this capacity.

Limitations

The 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity is related to the overall node capacity and can

limit the size of the node. The limitation on the node size can affect other

features.

Network Requirements

There are no network requirements for this capacity.

# 3 Feature Operation of 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity works through allocating 5+5 MHz sector carriers for units.

The 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity introduces a capacity license. The license restricts the

number of 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity units that can be activated on a node. This capacity

enables the allocation of 5+5 MHz capacity units for each sector carrier.

This capacity checks the free 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units when a cell that refers

to single or multiple sectors is unlocked or reconfigured. The operator can allocate more 5+5

MHz sector carrier capacity units, or undo the cell unlocking or reconfiguration if any of the

following happens:

- The free units are insufficient.
- The cell unlocked or reconfiguration fails.
- A relevant alarm is triggered.

## 3.1 Calculating the Number of Required 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units, FDD

The 5+5 MHz sector carrier is the capacity granularity for every cell per Radio Access

Technology (RAT) per node.

The operator can use the following formula to calculate the required number of 5+5 MHz sector

carrier capacity units for one cell:

The Configured Channel Bandwidth is the sum of values of the

EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth and the

EUtranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth attributes.

The number of cell sector carriers is determined by the

EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute.

For example, a 1.4 MHz/3 MHz cell with single sector carrier requires one 5+5 MHz unit. A 5

MHz cell with two sector carriers requires two units, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Examples of Required 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units Calculation, FDD

Example 1   Calculating the Number of Required Units, FDD

```
•  Required capacity units 
   = Ceiling (<Configured channel BW> / 10 MHz) * 
     <no. of SC of the cell>

•  Configured channel BW = 
   For DL only FDD cell
      : DL BW
   For FDD cell
      : DL BW + UL BW
   DL BW = EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth
   UL BW = EUtranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth
   UL channel bandwidth of each SC = ulCarrierBandwidth 
      from CAT(a lower value of ifBandwidth and 
      ulChannelBandwidth)

•  1.4 MHz/3 MHz require at least 1 unit of 
   5+5 MHz SectorCarrier license
```

## 3.2 Calculating the Number of Required 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units, TDD

The 5+5 MHz sector carrier is the capacity granularity for every cell per Radio Access

Technology (RAT) per node.

The operator can use the following formula to calculate the required number of 5+5 MHz sector

carrier capacity units for one cell:

The Configured Channel Bandwidth is determined by the

EUtranCellTDD.channelBandwidth attribute.

The number of sector carriers of a cell is determined by the

EUtranCellTDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute.

For example, a 5 MHz cell with two sector carriers requires two

units, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Examples of Required 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units Calculation, TDD

Example 2   Calculating the Number of Required Units, TDD Only

```
•  Required capacity units 
   = Ceiling (<Configured channel BW> / 10 MHz) * 
     <no. of SC of the cell>

•  Configured channel BW = 
   For TDD cell
      : BW
   BW = EUtranCellTDD.channelBandwidth

•  1.4 MHz/3 MHz require at least 1 unit of 
   5+5 MHz SectorCarrier license
```

## 3.3 Checking 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity

The CapacityFeatureLicense.capacityUnit attribute shows the value of the

5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity of a cell.

## 3.4 Allocating 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units

When unlocking or reconfiguring a cell, the eNodeB checks if there are sufficient free

licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units:

- If there are, the eNodeB allocates the 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units to the cell. The cell and all its SectorCarrier are successfully activated.
- If the free 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity units are sufficient for at least one referenced SectorCarrier but not all, the eNodeB only partly licenses the cell. The cell is activated with setting SectorCarrier.availabilityStatus attribute to DEGRADED. SectorCarrier can be activated while others fail. If this occurs, alarm Resource Allocation Failure is triggered. Note: The operator cannot configure the SectorCarrier in the activated cell, as it is dependent on the order in which SectorCarrier activation belongs to the cell.
- If the 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units are insufficient for all referenced SectorCarrier, the cell unlocking operation fails and the Resource Allocation Failure alarm is triggered.

## 3.5 Releasing 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units

When locking a cell, the 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated to the cell are

released and return to the unit pool. The Resource Allocation Failure alarm (if any) is ceased, along with any

other alarms in the cell.

## 3.6 Changing 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity

The operator can change the number of 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units by installing a

new LKF or activating the emergency state.

If the new license allows a lower number of 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units than the

allocated license, the activated cells stay in service. However, new unlocking cells are

rejected because of the license allocation failure. To release some units to match the new

license capacity, the operator can select cells to lock or reconfigure.

If a new license allows more 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity units,

the operator can unlock more cells. The operator can also reconfigure

cells to utilize the recently applied license capacity.

# 7 Enable or Disable Capacity

While license-controlled features need to be individually activated, capacities are

automatically enabled when the License Key File is installed on a node. Capacity cannot

be deactivated once it is enabled on the node.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity enforces the 5+5 MHz sector carrier license rules with software

upgrade.

Software Upgrade

The 5+5 MHz sector carrier license rules are instantly enforced during upgrade. This

is because of the node restart that results in unlocked cells and sector carriers.

To avoid network disturbance, operators need to have a clear upgrade strategy for

all nodes. The following high-level process is recommended:

1. Add 5+5 MHz sector carrier licenses to each customer bulk in Ericsson License Information System.
2. Download new LKFs which contain the number of licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units depending on the customer contract.
3. Deploy the new LKFs before downloading the software.
4. Ensure that all LKFs are updated before rolling out the software.

Before upgrading, it is suggested to verify the presence of 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

license key ID in UpgradePackage.verifyUpgrade MO. After the

upgrade is triggered, the presence of 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier license key ID is also

checked with UpgradePackage.rebootNodeUpgrade or

UpgradePackage.upgrade actions. If the license key ID is

found in the LKF, the verification or upgrade sequence continues. Otherwise, further

execution of the sequence is rejected. This status is visible in

UpgradePackage.actionResult attribute, without rollback.
