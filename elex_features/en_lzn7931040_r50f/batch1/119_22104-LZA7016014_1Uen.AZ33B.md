Summary

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature decreases the number of

unnecessary handovers in a radio network.

This

has the benefit of reduced signal load and increased

throughput

In a radio network where the HOM is configured to a high value, the UE Level

Oscillating Handover Minimization feature makes it possible to decrease the

configured HOM.

This

does not increase the number of handovers and has the benefit of allowing UEs to

perform a handover to the best cell earlier.

Figure 1   Time Measurements for the Decision Process and Performance Measurements

The handover decision process is different for intra-frequency and inter-frequency

relations.

The intra-frequency handover decision has the following specifications:

- The process is triggered by an A3 measurement.
- The node calculates the time in the current cell.
- The node checks the handover oscillation rules.
- The outcome is one of the following: Attempt the handover Reject the handover Apply an offset to the HOM

If the decision is to apply an offset, the process continues in the following way:

- The HOM is calculated.
- The offset is added to the HOM.
- The handover condition is checked. The result is one of the following decisions: Attempt the handover Reject the handover

The inter-frequency handover decision has the following specifications:

- The process is triggered by an A5 measurement.
- The node calculates the time in current cell.
- The node checks the handover oscillation rules.
- The outcome is one of the following decisions: Attempt the handover Reject the handover Apply an offset to the HOT

If the decision is to apply an offset, the process continues in the following way:

- The HOT is calculated.
- The offset is added to the HOT.
- The handover condition is checked. The result is one of the following decisions: Attempt the handover Reject the handover

Figure 2   Handover Oscillation Decision Process

This decision process modifies the handover sequence described in Intra-LTE Handover.

## 3.1 Process Steps

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature minimizes the number of

unnecessary handovers with prevention functions.

For every UE, the node measures the time in the current cell and keeps a record of the time

in

the last cell. The node then bases the handover decision on these values.

Handover Time Measurements and Handover Oscillation Detection

The time in the current cell is a time interval. It starts when the RLC and the MAC layer

of the Uu link is established between the UE and the node It is measured until the handover

attempt decision that the node makes when it receives the RRC measurement report.

The time in the last cell measurement is fetched from the UE History provided in the X2-AP

or S1-AP HANDOVER REQUEST message, from the last cell.

During every handover evaluation, the time in the current cell is measured and compared to

the configured time limits. Based on these measurements, a handover can be allowed without

any additional conditions, or the following specific prevention rules can be triggered:

- Prevention of Very Fast Handovers
- Prevention of Fast Intra-Frequency Handovers
- Prevention of Fast Inter-Frequency Handovers
- Prevention of Repeated Oscillating Handover to a Neighbor

For more information, see Table 3.

For more information about RRC, see 3GPP TS 36.331. For more

information about X2AP, see 3GPP TS 36.423. For more information

about S1AP, see 3GPP TS 36.413.

Prevention of Very Fast Handovers

When the UE Level Oscillation Handover Minimization feature is active, the node never

performs a very fast handover of a UE. The limit for very fast handovers is time limit1.

According to the standard process, if the UE is in the current cell for less than time

limit1, and the UE sends an RRC mobility measurement report, a handover is triggered.

Because of the prevention rule, the node does not attempt a handover in these cases.

Prevention of Fast Intra-Frequency Handovers

The node uses an increased HOM for fast handovers without reconfiguring the measurements in

the UE.

Without the UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature, the node configures the UE

with a specified HOM. The UE sends an A3 measurement report if the signal strength of a

target cell is higher than the signal strength of the serving cell. The HOM is calculated

using the formula in the following equation:

HOM = a3offset − cellIndividualOffsetEUtran + hysteresisA3

The reception of an A3 measurement report causes the node to attempt the handover of the UE

to the target cell.

For more information about the A3 measurement reports, see Intra-LTE Handover.

With this feature enabled, if the time in the current cell is less than time limit2, and

the last cell is the same as the target cell, the node applies the applicable

offset

to the HOM. For more information on offsets, see Table 3.

The node applies the extra offset by calculating the HOM, and checking whether the

condition in the following equation is valid:

SN&gt; SC + HOM + Offset

Signal strength in the current cell and signal strength in the neighbor cell are retrieved

from the A3 measurement report.

If the equation is valid, the handover is attempted and counted by the

EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscIntraF PM counter. When a QCI1 bearer is

established for the UE, the value of the EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscQci1

PM counter increases. Otherwise, handover is prevented and the value of the

EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscIntraF PM counter does not increase.

Prevention of Fast Inter-Frequency Handovers

![Image](../images/119_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AZ33B/additional_3_CP.png)

![Image](../images/119_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AZ33B/additional_3_CP.png)

For the prevention of fast handovers, the node increases the inter-frequency HOT with the

applicable offset. The offset has the same value for the prevention of fast inter-frequency

handovers and for the prevention of fast intra-frequency handovers. For more information on

offsets, see Table 3.

The HOT is calculated using one of the following equations, depending on the trigger

quantity used for the A5 measurement reports:

- If RSRP is used, the equation is the following: HOT = a5Threshold2RSRP − cellIndividualOffsetEUtran + hysteresisA5
- If RSRQ is used, the equation is the following: HOT = a5Threshold2RSRQ − cellIndividualOffsetEUtran + hysteresisA5

This is done by the node without reconfiguring the measurements in the UE.

Under certain conditions, the node configures the UE to send an A5 measurement report if

the signal strength of a target cell is higher than the HOT.

For more information on the A5 measurement reports, trigger quantities, and other

conditions that are not affected by the UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature,

see Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover.

After receiving an A5 measurement report, the node attempts the handover of the UE to the

target cell according to the standard process. With this feature enabled, if the time in

current cell is less than time limit2, and the last cell is the same as the target cell, the

node applies the applicable offset to the HOT.

The node applies the extra offset by calculating the HOT, and checking if the condition in

the following equation is valid. SN is retrieved from the A5 measurement report.

SN&gt; HOT + Offset

If the equation is valid, the handover is attempted and counted by the

EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscInterF PM counter. When a QCI1 bearer is

established for the UE, the value of the EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscQci1

PM counter increases. Otherwise, handover is prevented and the value of the

EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscInterF PM counter does not increase.

Prevention of Repeated Oscillating Handover to a Neighbor

The node prevents a repeated fast handover to a neighbor by using the applicable offset, if

the following conditions apply:

- Time in the last cell is less than time limit2.
- Time in the current cell is less than time limit3.

For more information on offsets, see Table 3.

In this case, the offset is used for both inter-frequency and intra-frequency handover in

the same way as described  in Prevention of Fast Intra-Frequency Handovers and Prevention of Fast Inter-Frequency Handovers.

If the stricter conditions are satisfied, handover is permitted by this feature, otherwise,

the

handover

is prevented.

# 4 Network Impact of UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature makes it possible to increase

capacity in the network, and decrease unnecessary handovers.

Performance and Capacity

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature enables increased capacity in the

network in many scenarios. The increase is made possible by allowing the operator to

configure a smaller HOM without increasing the rate of unnecessary handovers.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature reduces the number of unnecessary

handovers in the network in many scenarios.

# 5 Parameters of UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature affects MOM attributes by adding

offsets.

| a5Threshold2RSRP | Affected | In certain prevention processes, an offset is added to this parameter for one UE.                 The offset does not affect the parameter value registered in the MOM. |
| a5Threshold2RSRQ | Affected | In certain prevention processes, an offset is added to this parameter for one UE.                 The offset does not affect the parameter value registered in the MOM. |

# 6 Performance of UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization

The UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature has KPIs for downlink and uplink

throughput calculation, counters for handover calculation and performance management

events.

KPIs

| KPI                 | Description                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Downlink Throughput | Indicates the average downlink throughput for each UE.    |
| Uplink Throughput   | Indicates the average uplink throughput for each UE.      |
| E-RAB Retainability | Indicates the retainability of each UE in connected mode. |

Counters

- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscIntraF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscQci1

For a given neighbor relation, only one of

EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscInterF and

EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscIntraF steps, depending on the type of the

relation.

The counters are also available when the UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature

is not activated.
