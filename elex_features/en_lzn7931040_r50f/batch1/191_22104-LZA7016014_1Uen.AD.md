Summary

Supported UEs can experience a reduction in battery consumption with this feature.

This feature builds on the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature.

This feature provides the following benefits for both the network and PFT-capable

UEs:

- PFT-capable UEs are able to stay in RRC connected mode for a longer time, compared to the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature. This reduces the frequency of switching between RRC connected and RRC idle modes.
- PFT-capable UEs can quickly obtain a scheduling request when moving from out-of-sync to in-sync provided by fast scheduling resource allocation. PFT-capable UEs can then decide to stay out-of-sync while bundling delay sensitive data. This occupies network resources for a shorter time.
- PFT-capable UEs are not required to acknowledge the reception of an RRC Connection Release message when they are out-of-sync and the RRC inactivity timer expires.

# 3 Feature Operation of UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction

The UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction feature reduces the battery power consumption of

PFT UEs.

The PFT UE dynamically suggests a DRX configuration among a set

of predefined battery saving DRX profiles that suits the traffic type

being exchanged.

The PFT UE can request to move to out-of-sync mode and take advantage of a more battery

saving DRX configuration if the traffic exchanged is delay tolerant. A list of pairs of

customized time alignment timers. One of them is of short duration suitable for delay

tolerant traffic and a longer one that is used for other types of traffic.

On the expiry of the selected time alignment timer, the UE is moved to out-of-sync state. The

selection of the pair of time alignment timers is statically made at the handshaking

phase and it is decided by the eNodeB based on the

pftTatPairSelection parameter. The PFT UE can request the DRX

inactivity timer to be stopped to go to sleep immediately reducing its battery

consumption. The PFT UE can ask to be released to idle mode without waiting for the

inactivity timer expiry if no traffic is anticipated.

The network benefits from the released resources and the UE benefits from battery consumption

reduction. Implicit RRC connection release is introduced to allow the PFT UEs to be

released without a need to double RACH to switch to in-sync mode and then send the

acknowledgment for the release.

No battery power gain is lost because of the RACH. The PFT UE can request to stop the DRX

inactivity timer and switch to another DRX configuration on the next DRX on duration

reducing the need to wake up for scheduling request.

PFT Signaling Reduction

It is assumed that the UE has entered PFT mode as described in UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX.

Figure 1   PFT Signaling Reduction

The feature is related to in-sync, out-of-sync, RRC Connected, and RRC Idle modes as

follows:

1. The RRC Inactivity Timer is extended for all PFT UEs. This allows PFT UEs to stay in RRC-Connected mode longer than with the legacy timer. Staying in RRC-Connected mode reduces the amount of switching between Connected and Idle modes. This reduces the amount of RRC signaling.
2. For delay sensitive traffic, UEs are able to stay in-sync for a longer time because of a longer time alignment timer. This reduces the signaling and resources needed to switch back and forth between in-sync and out-of-sync modes. This also allows for battery saving potential at the UE.
3. Fast scheduling request assignment allows the eNodeB to send an allocated scheduling request resource to a PFT UE without having to wait for the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message. This allows the PFT UE to respond quickly to delay sensitive traffic while reducing the need for the UE to re-RACH to acquire a scheduling request resource. This contributes to PFT UE battery savings.
4. A new unacknowledged release procedure is used when the RRC Inactivity timer expires for an out-of-sync PFT UE. The RRC Connection Release procedure is on the eNodeB but it does not require the out-of-sync PFT UE to come in-sync to be released. As a result, there is a reduction in signaling between the UE and the eNodeB and the PFT UE has additional battery saving potential.

# 4 Network Impact of UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction

This feature impacts the performance of PFT UEs.

Capacity and Performance

PFT UEs can transition more frequently between out-of-sync and in-sync, which can lead to

increased RACH load. A PFT UE can choose a DRX profile with a long DRX sleep time resulting

in increased latency.

The number of UEs in RRC Connected mode can increase because more PUCCH resources are made

available by a higher number of out-of-sync PFT UEs. At high load, some out-of-sync UEs

cannot find resources to be able to come back to in-sync mode.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Supported UEs can experience a reduction in battery consumption.
