# 2 Benefits of Energy Efficiency

The Energy Efficiency value package lowers RAN energy consumption, improves energy

efficiency, and contributes to lower energy OPEX without degrading network

performance.

The features included in the Energy Efficiency value package reduce power consumption

while maintaining network performance using the following functionalities:

- Switching off power amplifiers on radio units on a microsecond level if there is no data to transmit
- Automatically turning off capacity cells that are not required
- Automatically turning off radio transmit branches that are not required for the current traffic demand
- Operator-controlled thresholds that are used to enable and disable sleep mode

## 3.1 Cell Sleep Mode Overview

The Cell Sleep Mode feature provides automatic energy savings.

| Feature Name           | Cell Sleep Mode                                                            |

| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The main benefit of the Cell Sleep Mode feature is automatic energy saving.

In densely populated networks, overlaid cells are deployed. Without this feature,

cells are constantly turned on. With the Cell Sleep Mode feature, the overlaid

capacity cells can detect low traffic conditions and turn off to save energy with

confirmed support from overlaid coverage cells. The overlaid coverage cell monitors

traffic conditions to turn on the sleeping cells. This is a SON capability that is

adaptive to the network traffic conditions.

When an overlaid capacity cell is turned off, the traffic load in the cell is

offloaded to overlaid coverage cells. Overlaid coverage cells can be configured

manually or automatically. The Cell Sleep Mode feature provides Coverage Cell

Discovery, which can automatically detect neighbor cells that are capable to serve

as overlaid coverage cells. Enabling the Cell Sleep Mode feature is not required in

overlaid coverage cells.

Once overlaid capacity cells are turned off for energy saving reasons, the CRS

interference is reduced in the network. Therefore, UE throughput can be

improved.

Capacity cells are dynamically and automatically turned on and off based on the

current traffic load. This reduces power consumption and inter-cell interference.

Therefore, the Cell Sleep Mode feature can reduce OPEX.

Figure 1   Example Scenario for Energy Saving for E-UTRAN

In this scenario, E-UTRAN Cells C, D, E, F, and G are covered by E-UTRAN Cells A and

B. Here, Cell A and Cell B have been deployed to provide basic coverage, while the

other E-UTRAN cells boost the capacity. When some cells that provide additional

capacity are no longer needed, they can be switched off to save energy. In this

case, both the continuity of the LTE coverage and the QoS is guaranteed by coverage

cells.

| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0413                                                                                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                                                |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                                                |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                 node. |

Summary

The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature maximizes the number of blank subframes by

delaying traffic data transmission until the traffic data conditions meet a specific

threshold. This is achieved by utilizing the Micro Sleep Tx feature to turn off

power amplifiers. Blank subframes consume less energy, so the energy consumption is

reduced.

Only downlink transmission is in the scope of this feature.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature reduces power consumption in radios in the node. This is achieved by

automatically changing the MIMO configuration to a smaller MIMO or a SIMO

configuration when low traffic conditions are detected in the cell.

Based on machine intelligence techniques, the feature discovers, learns, and applies

optimal MIMO configuration automatically. The feature does not require manual

configuration, however, the model accuracy level threshold can be manually

configured.

In a smaller MIMO and SIMO configuration, power consumption is reduced because of

either of the following reasons:

- Lower RF radiation at the radio unit
- Shutting down the radio unit power amplifier of the deactivated TX antennas

The decision point and the capability depend on the radio unit capacity.
