# 1 7-12 Cell Support Overview

The 7-12 Cell Support feature enables the configuration of up to 12

cells.

Summary

The 7-12 Cell Support feature allows the configuration of up to 12 cells. For

example, with 12 cells, a three sector site

with

four carriers each can be supported in one eNodeB.

The feature supports both single-carrier and dual-carrier configurations with carrier

or sector pooling, which enables flexibility and cost-effective ways for building

networks in different cases.

12-cell configurations provide increased coverage, especially where physical barriers

limit the cell coverage area, for example, for indoor deployments.

The

7-12 Cell Support feature provides the following benefits:

- Increased eNodeB capacity
- Sector coverage redundancy for dual-carrier configurations

# 2 Dependencies of 7-12 Cell Support

The 7-12 Cell Support feature requires the 6 Cell Support feature and is related to

several other features.

# 6 Performance of 7-12 Cell Support

The ENodeBFunction.pmMoFootprintMax counter is used to specify the

current footprint in the eNodeB from the configured MO instances for all different Cell

Relations and External Cells in relation to the MO system limit.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

- ENodeBFunction.pmMoFootprintMax

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate 7-12 Cell Support

To use this feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011356 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate 7-12 Cell Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any conflicting

feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011356 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for 7-12 Cell Support

Configuring 7 to 12 Cells When a License is Missing

![Image](../images/171_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.BJ/additional_3_CP.png)

![Image](../images/171_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.BJ/additional_3_CP.png)

In a node without the 7-12 Cell Support feature license, more than six cells can be

configured, but only three cells can be unlocked. If the 6 Cell Support feature license is activated, the number

of unlocked cells can increase to six. Requests to unlock additional cells result in

the Configuration Requires Feature Activation

alarm on the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO. Additional text in

the alarm indicates that a license for the 7-12 Cell Support feature is missing.

Removing or Deactivating the License With More Than Six Cells in

Operation

Removing or deactivating the license in a node takes effect when the cells are locked

and unlocked, or when the node is restarted. This means that enabled cells are not

immediately affected when the license is removed or deactivated.
