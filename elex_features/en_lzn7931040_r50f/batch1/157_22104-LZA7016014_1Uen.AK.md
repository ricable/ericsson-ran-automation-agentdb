# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Multiuser MIMO

Operation of the Uplink Multiuser MIMO feature, including network configuration

requirements and operation flows.

In the Uplink Multiuser MIMO feature, the eNodeB can select two users to transmit data on the

same time and frequency resources without notifying the users, which increases uplink cell

throughput.

As shown in Figure 1, by assigning two UEs with

the same uplink frequency resource, the used PUSCH resources for them are shared. In this way,

the main benefit is that the spectrum efficiency of the cell is increased and more data is

transmitted without increasing the radio bandwidth.

Figure 1   Overview of the Uplink Multiuser MIMO Feature

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 2 shows the feature operation sequence. When the

Uplink Multiuser MIMO feature is implemented, the UEs (UE0, UE1, UE3, and UE5) that meet the

pairing criteria are selected and paired. The same PRB resources are allocated to the paired

UEs (UE0 and UE1, UE3 and UE5). The eNodeB can decode the multiplexed UE data in the

receiver. Such a mechanism increases cell throughput without expanding the radio

bandwidth.
