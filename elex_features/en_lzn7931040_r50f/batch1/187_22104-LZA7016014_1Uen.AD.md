# 1 Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support Overview

Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support introduces the functionality to support

handling of emergency calls in an LTE network for UEs in limited service mode.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1743                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

The feature enables the UE user to setup and maintain emergency calls even when UE is

out of home network coverage or there is no SIM card inserted.

This comprises:

- Broadcast in SIB1 of an ims-EmergencySupport indicator of the core network support of emergency calls for UEs in limited service mode, for example UEs without a SIM card. With this indication UEs are allowed to set up emergency calls in limited service mode.
- Support of EIA0 (null) integrity protection algorithm and EEA0 (null) ciphering protection algorithm expected to be (implicitly) signaled by the MME for UEs in limited service mode. Note: EIA0 (null) integrity protection algorithm and EEA0 (null) ciphering protection algorithm is supported regardless of the configuration of the following parameters: SecurityHandling.cipheringAlgoPrio SecurityHandling.integrityProtectAlgoPrio
- Support of mobility of emergency calls for UEs in limited service mode.

# 2 Dependencies of Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

The Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support feature supports the admission

control functionality in prioritizing emergency calls.

| Admission Control (FAJ 121 1857) | Related        | Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support can be seen as an add-on                                 to the feature Admission Control, which is part of LTE Basic. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

This feature has no prerequisite network configuration requirements.

# 3 Network Impact of Limited Service Mode Emergency Call

The Limited Service Mode Emergency Call feature has an impact on the capacity and

mobility of a network by granting access to emergency calls in limited service mode.

Capacity and Performance

There is a minor impact on network capacity, as UEs (which are normally served by other

networks) are allowed to make emergency call in this network.

Mobility

There is a minor impact on mobility because UEs in limited service mode are granted access

during handover attempts.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
