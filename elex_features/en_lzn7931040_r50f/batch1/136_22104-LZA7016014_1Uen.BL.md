Summary

This feature increases uplink throughput for UEs with uplink 64-QAM

capability in areas with good coverage, and makes the uplink spectrum more

efficient.

The benefits on uplink cell throughput increases if more receiving antennas are used. This

feature provides support of 64-QAM modulation in the uplink for Category 4 and

Category 5 UEs with UL Category 5, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.306.

This feature enables higher-order modulation on PUSCH, increases the number of bits for each

symbol used in LTE physical layer resources, and improves throughput.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Increased uplink peak rate up to 70 Mbps for 64-QAM capable UEs in FDD 20-MHz bandwidth
- Increased uplink throughput for 64-QAM capable UEs in areas with good coverage

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- MCS 0-28, are supported for Category 5 UEs, where MCS 21-28 are used with 64-QAM modulation.
- MCS 0-24 are supported for non-Category 5 UEs, where MCS 21-24 are used with 16-QAM modulation.

Network Requirements

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a

valid license key must be installed and the feature must be explicitly activated by

setting a MOM attribute.

# 3 Feature Operation of 64-QAM Uplink

The feature increases uplink throughput using 64-QAM modulation on PUSCH.

The 64-QAM Uplink feature does the following:

- Enables higher-order modulation on PUSCH
- Increases the number of bits per symbol used in LTE physical layer resources
- Improves throughput

# 4 Network Impact of 64-QAM Uplink

The feature allows increasing the overall uplink cell throughput, depending on the ratio

of the 64-QAM

users.

Capacity and Performance

64-QAM is selected based on estimated uplink channel quality.

Since UE is power limited, 64-QAM can be applied in good radio conditions with the

knowledge of the power headroom of the UE.

The overall uplink cell throughput and spectral efficiency is expected to increase

however, the amount of the increase depends on the ratio of 64-QAM users and their

channel characteristics.

Ideally the Uplink 64-QAM allows the following values for single user uplink peak

rate and spectral efficiency:

- ~75 Mbps in 20 MHz, while ~55 Mbps in case of 16-QAM

- 3.75 bits/s/Hz, while 2.75 bits/s/Hz in case of 16-QAM

RBs are allocated to PUSCH and PRACH. So a realistic single user uplink peak rate is

70 Mbps with 90% 96 SBs allocation and 10% 90 SBs allocation.

When the feature is enabled, the enable64QAM and the enable64QAM-v1270 information

elements are true in SIB2 and Mobility Control Information.

# 7 Activate 64-QAM Uplink

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011946 MO instance.
2. Perform the cell lock and unlock procedure after changing the feature state.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate 64-QAM Uplink

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011946 MO instance.
2. Perform the cell lock and unlock procedure after changing the feature state.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
