| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required. |

The UE uses the random access process to gain access to cells for the following reasons:

- Initial access to the network from the idle state
- Regaining access to the network after a radio link failure
- Gaining timing synchronization with a new cell as part of the handover process
- Regaining uplink time alignment
- Request uplink grant for UE without dedicated scheduling request resource

The random access process allows multiple UEs, transmitting different random access preamble

codes in uplink on the PRACH, to gain simultaneous access to a cell.

The correct operation of the random access process is required to ensure the following

actions:

- Initial access to the network
- Correct operation of LTE handover
- Successful transmission of downlink and uplink data
- Successful UE paging

Hardware

No special hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The LTE basic system must be configured to allow UE to use CBRA for the following:

- Initial network access
- Handover between cells
- Synchronization for uplink transfers
- Access following a radio link failure

CFRA is disabled by default.

# 3 Feature Operation of Random Access

The Random Access feature allows the UE to obtain new or renewed access to the network,

and to obtain uplink timing synchronization.

The Random Access feature allows multiple UEs to use different random access preamble codes

to gain simultaneous access to a cell. The random access preamble codes are transmitted in

uplink on the PRACH. The preamble codes exhibit extensive cross-correlation properties. This

allows the eNodeB to detect multiple random access preambles in the same PRACH activity.

The following different forms of the random access process are used:

- The CFRA process is initiated by the network. It is used when the UE is known to the network. The CFRA uses a dedicated random access preamble code allocated to the UE for a limited period. This can increase the probability of random access success, and eliminates the need for contention resolution. CFRA process is used for handover and synchronization.
- The CBRA process is initiated by the UE to gain access to the network. It involves the UE randomly selecting one random access preamble code from a list of codes available for selection by all UE in the cell. CBRA requires additional signaling to resolve contention. Contention can occur when multiple UE attempts are made to access the cell in the same PRACH subframe using the same preamble code. The CBRA process can be used for all random access applications.

The difference between the CFRA and CBRA is that in CFRA the UE is assigned a dedicated

preamble code sequence by the cell. No other UE can attempt a random access using the same

preamble code sequence. This makes the CFRA process faster.

| Random Access Cases                                                | CBRA   | CFRA   |

| Incoming handover between cells                                    | •      | •      |

Figure 1   Operational Process of Random Access

## 3.1 CFRA Preamble Assignment

For each LTE cell where the CFRA is enabled, several preamble codes are reserved for CFRA.

The assignment of the preamble sequence by the network makes the random access faster as there

is no need for contention resolution. It is used for handover and synchronization as it

reduces the time taken for UE to complete these tasks.

The preamble code required for the random access is sent to the UE on the following downlink

dedicated signaling:

- Handover command by the serving eNodeB if handover is active
- PDCCH order if uplink synchronization is active

If the CFRA is disabled, no dedicated preambles are allocated.

In this case, the preambles are used for the CBRA.

## 3.2 Random Access Preamble

The random access preamble transmission is common to both CFRA and CBRA processes.

The UE transmits random access preamble bursts on the PRACH uplink channel. The network

provides information about the PRACH to the UE in an overhead message. This allows the UE to

determine when the PRACH channels are scheduled and also determines the preamble format and

code sequence to use.

The following information is included in the overhead message:

- The LTE Basic system uses preamble format 0. This format provides a maximum cell coverage range of about 15 km.
- The LTE Basic system allocates one PRACH occurrence in each 10-ms radio frame.
- The LTE Basic system applies the unrestricted set of cyclic shifts for preambles.
- The High Speed UE feature applies the restricted set of cyclic shifts for preambles.

The random access transmission process uses open-loop power control. The UE estimates the

transmission power required to achieve a specified reception power value at the eNodeB for the

first random access burst. Power ramping is used for subsequent retransmission bursts if they

are required. This process continues until the UE successfully receives a response from the

eNodeB or the maximum number of retransmission attempts is reached.

High Speed UE

## 3.3 Random Access Response Message

The eNodeB generates the random access response message that is transmitted on the PDSCH to a

specific RA-RNTI address. The random access response message can contain responses to more

than one detected random access preamble code. It is also possible to send multiple random

access response messages within the random access response window. This means that the eNodeB

can respond to random access attempts from multiple UEs that are transmitted in the same PRACH

subframe.

The UE monitors the PDCCH for its specific RA-RNTI address that matches the subframe number

in which the random access preamble burst is transmitted.

The random access response message includes the following information:

- Random access preamble sequence code that identifies the preamble sequence code detected by the eNodeB.
- Initial uplink grant used for transmitting the subsequent data on the uplink channel
- Time alignment information ensuring that subsequent uplink data transmissions are time aligned at the eNodeB receiver, that is, do not interfere with uplink transmissions from other UE in adjacent subframes.
- A temporary C-RNTI

## 3.4 Scheduled Transmission

In CBRA process, the UE undertakes the first scheduled uplink transmission on PUSCH

following the successful receipt of a random access response message. The UE provides the

network with a unique identifier in this message.

The scheduled transmission is used for robustness by the CFRA process.

For handover, if a CFRA procedure is chosen but the eNodeB fails to receive the scheduled

transmission, a PDCCH order is sent to the UE. This message has the same CFRA preamble for

repeating CFRA attempts.

## 3.5 Contention Resolution

The contention resolution is used only by the CBRA process to resolve a situation where two

UEs attempt random access using the same preamble code sequence.

The eNodeB echoes the UE identity provided in the scheduled transmission. A terminal declares

the random access process successful if it finds a match between the identity received in the

contention resolution and the identity transmitted in the scheduled transmission.

Without a match between the identity received in the contention resolution and the respective

identity transmitted as part of the scheduled transmission, the random access is unsuccessful

for a terminal. Therefore, the random access process must restart.

Both the scheduled transmission and the contention resolution use HARQ process.

HARQ retransmissions are used until the match is successful or it exceeds the maximum

allowed retransmission time.

# 4 Network Impact of Random Access

The feature affects inter-cell handover.

Capacity and Performance

The Random Access feature affects inter-cell handover outage times because the UE needs to

attempt a random access to the target cell during the handover process. This is to gain the

timing advance information required for subsequent data transmission to the target cell.

The UE without uplink timing synchronization must perform the random access process to get

timing advance information for subsequent data bursts. Data transmissions to and from the UE

cannot proceed until uplink synchronization is achieved. This has an impact on the

throughput and latency experienced by the UE.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Random Access

The feature is associated with KPIs used to measure success rate.

| Initial E-RAB Establishment Success Rate | Indicates the performance of the establishment of LTE radio bearers. The bearer                   establishment process begins with the CBRA process. |

The CBRA and CFRA Success Rate equations can be inaccurate because they estimate the number

of detected preambles, and assume that a detected preamble is a random access attempt. The

following equations provide an approximate indication of the Random Access Success Rate:

- CBRA Success Rate if CFRA is enabled
- CBRA Success Rate if CFRA is disabled
- CFRA Success Rate

Based on the 3GPP requirement for white noise, the false alarm probability is expected to

be less than for all 64 preambles. Interference increases the false alarm probability, which

can be calculated by considering the ratio between the pmRaAttCbra

counter and the number of random access preamble opportunities during the measurement

period. For example, if the measurement period is 15 minutes, the following applies:

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Random Access

The optimal cell range configuration can improve the feature operation.

Enabling CFRA

The CFRA is disabled by default for all cells but can be enabled in any cell by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.cfraEnable or EUtranCellTDD.cfraEnable

attribute to true.

RACH Root Sequence Configuration

The first root sequence number for RACH preamble generation in each cell can be specified

by setting the EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or the

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence attributes.

To minimize the probability of a false alarm, it is recommended to set the

EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or the

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence attributes to different values in

neighboring cells. This difference is recommended to be at least the number of RACH root

sequences in the cell.

For example, for the 15-km cell range, 10 RACH root sequences are required when using the

unrestricted set. Because of this, the difference between the

EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or the

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence attribute values is recommended to be at

least 10 and no more than 827 for all neighboring cells.

Counter Range Calculation

If the timing offset of the preamble corresponds to a distance that is greater than the

configured cell range, the CBRA and CFRA preambles are discarded.

The following counters measure the number of the discarded preambles:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc

The pmRaAttTaDistr and pmRaSuccTaDistr counters show

the distribution of the measured timing offset TA values from all detected possible random

access attempts (for pmRaAttTaDistr) or successful random access (for

pmRaSuccTaDistr). The TA values are expressed as a percentage of the

TAs that correspond to the configured cell range.

The following counters measure the TA distribution:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaAttTaDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaAttTaDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRaSuccTaDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRaSuccTaDistr

The corresponding observable distance is limited, and depends on the NCS

configuration. NCS is the cyclic shift value used for the random access preamble

generation. For more information, see Section 5.7.2 in 3GPP TS 36.211.

The appropriate NCS configuration is selected automatically for the configured

cell range. Each NCS configuration has a corresponding maximum cell range, and

this is the maximum observable distance of the counters for the given configuration. Table 4 contains these ranges and the NCS

values for each NCS configuration, when using preamble format 0-3. The maximum

observable distance of the counters is the closest bigger maximum cell range value to the

configured cell range. The timing offset TA of the preamble can only be correctly calculated

if the UE is in the observable distance.

Table 4   Maximum Cell Ranges for Each NCS Configuration

(1)

The unrestricted set of cyclic shifts is used by normal UEs.

(2)

The restricted set of cyclic shifts is used by high-speed UEs. Type A and B

correspond to different speed ranges.

For example, using the unrestricted set, if the configured cell range is 4 km, it is less

than 4.6 km but higher than 3.7 km, so it corresponds to NCS configuration 7,

with NCS = 38. The maximum observable distance is the maximum cell range, 4.6 km.

So the range of the pmRaFailCbraMsg1DiscOoc or the

pmRaFailCfraMsg1DiscOoc attribute is 4.6 - 4.0 = 0.6 km.
