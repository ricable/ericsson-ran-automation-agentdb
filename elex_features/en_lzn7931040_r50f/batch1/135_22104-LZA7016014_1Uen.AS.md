Summary

Paging is the only way for the network to notify UEs in idle mode about incoming data

sessions. As UEs normally use DRX, broadcast of paging has to coincide with the awake

periods of UEs. Optimal configuration of the Paging feature and related DRX parameters has

the following benefits:

- Prolonging the battery life of UEs
- Reducing connection times for terminating data sessions
- Ensuring high success rates for terminating data sessions
- Optimizing the paging traffic load

Paging MO. The Paging MO is a child of the

eNodeBFunction MO. The Paging parameters and counters are

common to all cells in the RBS.

Parameters for Paging

# 3 Feature Operation of Paging

Paging is achieved by using paging messages to let the UEs know about incoming data

sessions.

Paging is used by the core network to notify a specific UE in idle state about incoming data

sessions. Paging messages are sent by the core network to all RBSs in the tracking area.

The UE monitors the PDCCH at regular intervals, according to the DRX configuration, to check

for the presence of a paging message. The UE can spend the remainder of the time in sleep

mode. DRX behavior of the UE is configured by parameters broadcast in SIB2.

The feature uses the PDCCH and the PDSCH to transmit paging messages. The TAC is associated

with one of the tracking areas.

Figure 1   Paging in LTE RAN

1. The RBS receives S1AP paging messages with or without priority.
2. If the Priority Paging feature is enabled, the RBS performs prioritization of the paging messages. For more information about prioritization, see Priority Paging.
3. Paging messages are transmitted in all cells within the affected tracking area by the RBS on the PDSCH. The P-RNTI is broadcast on the PDCCH where the information is found about the modulation and coding scheme of the PDSCH data that contains the RRC paging message.
4. The information in PDCCH is transmitted with a CRC, which is scrambled with the P-RNTI. This notifies the UEs about the presence of a paging message within the same subframe.
5. When a UE detects a P-RNTI on the PDCCH, it demodulates and decodes the paging message contained in the PDSCH, and forwards it over the PCH to the MAC layer. The PCH transport block contains the exact identity of the terminal being paged. If the UE does not find its own identity on the detected PCH, it discards the PCH data and returns to sleep mode, according to the DRX cycle.

Reception of S1AP Paging Messages

When the LTE network receives an incoming call or data session targeting a UE registered in

the network, the MME tries to notify the UE. An S1AP paging message is transmitted over the

S1 interface to all RBSs within the tracking area where the target UE is registered. The

S1AP paging message contains the information required for the RBS to uniquely address the

target UE outside its DRX period, such as when the UE is not in sleep mode.

Transmission of RRC Paging Messages to the UE

Each RBS receiving the S1AP paging message from the MME sends a RRC paging message to those

cells belonging to the tracking area stated in the S1AP paging message. The RRC paging

message is transmitted in the paging frame and paging occasion of the specific UE. If the

RBS receives several S1AP paging messages to UEs that have the same paging frame and paging

occasion, information about more than one UE can be included in the same RRC paging message.

The message notifies all of the referenced UEs about incoming data sessions.

Discontinuous Reception

Parameters controlling DRX are contained in the SIB message in the cell broadcast through

SIB2. These parameters are used by the UE to calculate when to wake up to monitor the paging

channel. The transmission of paging messages in the time domain in the LTE network is based

on the concept of a paging frame and paging occasion. A paging frame is one radio frame,

which can contain one or multiple paging occasions. A paging occasion is a subframe and can

contain a paging message.

The UE uses a formula to calculate its paging frames and paging occasions, indicating

specific subframes that can contain paging messages addressed to that UE. Paging frame and

paging occasion calculation uses the IMSI of the UE. Using this formula, paging occasions

for UEs in the network are spread out in time. The UE is required to monitor all of its

paging occasions to determine if a paging message is addressed to it. For more information

on the formula, see 3GPP TS 36.304.

## 3.1 Paging Overload Protection

To improve eNodeB reliability and robustness, a paging overload protection mechanism

is introduced.

This mechanism protects the eNodeB from being overloaded by incoming paging traffic from

the core network. Incoming paging traffic intensity is monitored continuously, and if it

reaches the maximum allowed value, the paging message is discarded. Discarded paging

messages are not counted by the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPagReceived or EUtranCellTDD.pmPagReceived
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPagDiscarded or EUtranCellTDD.pmPagDiscarded

Incoming paging traffic intensity is monitored by the

ENodeBFunction.pmPagS1Received PM counter, and in case of paging

overload, paging messages are discarded, and the

ENodeBFunction.pmPagS1Discarded PM counter is incremented.

# 4 Network Impact of Paging

This feature impacts the network based on its paging capacity and the maximum number of

paging records sent in a paging occasion.

Capacity and Performance

Paging messages are transmitted by the RBS on the PDSCH along with system messages and user

data. If no paging messages are transmitted in a paging occasion, then user data can be

transmitted by the RBS instead.

The paging capacity of the network is impacted by the number of paging occasions and the

maximum number of paging records that can be transmitted in a paging occasion. If the RBS

KPIs indicate that there are many discarded paging messages, the following can be

increased:

- The number of paging occasions
- The maximum number of paging records per paging occasion

The paging intensity is limited in the RBS by a maximum permitted intensity. For the

purpose of tracking area dimensioning, the average paging intensity must not exceed 90% of

the maximum permitted intensity.

The recommended paging capacity for Baseband Radio Nodes is 1250 pages per second.

The RBS is automatically configured to ensure that the modulation scheme and coding rate

used for the transmission of paging messages provides a coverage equivalent to the

following:

- Other control messages
- Reference symbols transmitted by the RBS

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
