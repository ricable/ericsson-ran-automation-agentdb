# 1 Idle Mode Support Overview

The Idle Mode Support feature enables the UE in idle mode to access the network and be

reached from the network within acceptable delay.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | Part of LTE Basic                      |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                    |
| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required. |

Summary

The Idle Mode Support feature is part of LTE Basic. The UE has no active connection to the

RAN in idle mode.

Inter-frequency and IRAT cell reselection are parts of other features as described in the

following documentation:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity

When leaving idle mode and establishing the RRC connection, access class restrictions can

be used to reduce the number of simultaneous access attempts performed by the UE.

Correct PLMN identity configuration, and cell selection and cell reselection criteria can

provide the following benefits:

- They are essential to ensure good network coverage.
- They help with load balancing.
- They help in tuning network performance.

The PLMN selection and the selection and reselection of cells within the selected PLMN

functions keep the UE in idle mode within the reach of the network. Keeping the UE in idle

mode has the following benefits:

- It minimizes radio resource use in both the UE and the network.
- It can extend UE battery operation time.

Access class restrictions enable access denial for a certain fraction of UE to save network

resources, for example, in situations where network resources can become congested. Access

class restrictions allow normal service to be maintained for the UE of selected access

classes and for the fraction of the UE where access is granted.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

Paging is a feature used to reach the UE in idle mode with mobile-terminated user data and

signaling. More information, see Paging.

The idle mode tasks performed by the UE are aided by system information broadcast by the

network in each cell. For more information on the broadcast of system information, see the

following documentation:

- Manage Radio Network
- Manage Bearers and Services

# 3 Feature Operation of Idle Mode Support

The feature supports processes that the UE performs in idle mode.

Operational Process

Figure 1 shows a high-level view of the

relation between the main tasks the UE performs in idle mode.

Figure 1   High-Level Idle Mode Process

- The UE performs a PLMN selection when switched on, and when a new PLMN is found during lack of coverage. Manual PLMN selection is also possible.Note: After PLMN selection, the UE in idle mode can perform a background search for alternative PLMNs. If a higher priority PLMN is found, a new PLMN selection can be performed.
- When a PLMN is selected, the UE in idle mode performs cell selection and reselection. The objective is to find a suitable cell for camping. The procedure involves ranking eligible cells, based on the received signal strength and quality, evaluated against thresholds and other criteria defined in the network.
- When a suitable cell is selected, the UE can register in the PLMN using attach procedures.
- When attached, the UE registers its location periodically at regular intervals or when entering a tracking area where the current registration is not valid. Location registration is performed during the tracking area update process.
- If the UE is rejected in the new location, a new PLMN selection is required to find a suitable cell.

For more information, see the following documents:

- 3GPP TS 23.122
- 3GPP TS 36.304

## 3.1 PLMN Selection

The PLMN selection and registration of the UE in the selected PLMN are required before the UE

is able to receive normal service from the network. During the PLMN selection, the UE searches

the Radio Frequency channels in the E-UTRA bands and the frequency bands of other RATs, based

on its capability, to find available PLMNs.

The UE reads system information from the strongest cell on each RF carrier to determine the

available PLMNs. The UE selects a PLMN from the set of available PLMNs. The RBS includes a set

of PLMN identities in the plmn-IdentityList in parameter SIB type 1 in

each cell, indicating the PLMNs available in the cell. For the details of the configuration of

the PLMN identities and the associated parameters, see the following documents:

- Manage Radio Network, Services and Bearers in the Baseband Radio Node library
- Shared LTE RAN

## 3.2 Cell Selection and Reselection in Idle Mode

The UE in idle mode uses cell reselection for mobility. In idle mode, mobility is largely

controlled by the UE and supported by broadcast parameters. The exact behavior of the terminal

can vary between UE models. When the Shared LTE RAN feature is activated, terminals can get

different instructions depending on the tracking area.

After PLMN selection, and when the UE returns to idle mode after

RRC connection release, the UE performs cell selection to find a cell

where it is able to camp.

Figure 2   Cell Selection and Reselection in Idle Mode

Figure 2 is a high-level overview of the

process. For a complete specification, see 3GPP TS 36.304.

In the cell selection process, the UE performs a scan of E-UTRA radio frequencies based on

its capability. The UE can optimize the scanning based on prior knowledge about the available

E-UTRA carriers stored in the UE.

A suitable cell is a cell that meets the following criteria:

- It fulfills the cell selection criterion.
- It is not barred.
- It is part of the selected PLMN and belongs to a Tracking Area not listed in the UE as forbidden.

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.304.

When the UE finds a suitable cell to camp on, it enters the camped

normally state. It is able to receive normal service from the network.

Once camped on a cell, the UE continues to monitor certain triggering criteria for the

initiation of the cell reselection evaluation process where the UE can choose a new cell to

camp on.

If the UE is unable to find a suitable cell, it enters the any cell

selection state, where it attempts to find an acceptable cell.

An acceptable cell meets the following criteria:

- It fulfills the cell selection criterion.
- It is not barred.
- It belongs to any PLMN or Tracking Area.

If the UE is able to find an acceptable cell to camp on, it enters the camped

on any cell state. In this state, the UE is unable to receive normal service

from the network. The UE is not allowed to enter connected mode except for emergency

calls.

In the camped on any cell state, the UE repeatedly attempts to

find a suitable cell. For this purpose, it scans the following radio frequencies:

- E-UTRA frequencies
- Frequencies used in other RATs based on its capabilities

### 3.2.1 Cell Selection Criterion

The cell selection criterion, or S criterion is based on the measured RSRP level and

RSRQ level in the cell, normalized with the minimum required receive signal level in the cell

and certain compensations.

The RSRP-based evaluation for UE cell selection and reselection in idle mode is introduced as

a mandatory UE functionality in 3GPP release 8. The RSRQ-based evaluation for UE cell

selection and reselection in idle mode is added as a mandatory UE functionality in 3GPP

release 9.

The cell selection criteria fulfillment is based on Srxlev&gt; 0

AND Squal&gt; 0. If RSRQ-based evaluation is not supported, the

cell selection criteria fulfillment is based on Srxlev&gt;

0. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.304.

The cell selection criterion is fulfilled if:

Srxlev&gt; 0 AND Squal&gt; 0

where:

Srxlev = Qrxlevmeas − (Qrxlevmin +

Qrxlevminoffset) − Pcompensation

Squal = Qqualmeas − (Qqualmin +

Qqualminoffset)

The UE obtains the Srxlev value using the following

measurements and parameter values:

### 3.2.2 Intra-Frequency, Inter-Frequency, and IRAT Cells

Distinctions are made between intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and IRAT cells in an

E-UTRA radio access network.

Cell selection and reselection differentiates between the following cell types:

- Intra-frequency cells are E-UTRA cells with the same center frequency, that is the same E-UTRA carrier frequency.
- Different E-UTRA carrier frequencies are considered as inter-frequency carriers.
- Cells on inter-frequency carriers are considered as inter-frequency cells.
- Cells belonging to a RAT other than E-UTRA, such as GERAN, UTRAN, or CDMA2000, are referred to as IRAT cells. The carrier frequencies of IRAT cells are referred to as IRAT frequencies.

### 3.2.3 Measurements Performed by UE

Idle mode measurements are performed in the camped

normally and camped on any cell states, depending

on parameters broadcast in system information. The results from these measurements are used in

the cell reselection evaluation process.

The UE in idle mode measures the RSRP and the RSRQ levels of the E-UTRA cells on the current

frequency and any inter-frequency carriers and the signal levels of cells on any IRAT

frequency.

The number of measurements the UE performs can affect UE battery performance. A trade-off

between cell reselection and UE battery performance is required when setting configuration

parameter values to control these measurements.

The criteria for performing the different kinds of measurements are based on the

Srxlev and the Squal values of the serving cell.

Measurements on intra-frequency cells are performed if one of the following conditions apply

for the serving cell:

- Srxlev ≤ SIntraSearchP
- Squal ≤ SIntraSearchQ

The UE does not need to perform the measurements if the following conditions apply:

- Srxlev&gt; SIntraSearchP
- Squal&gt; SIntraSearchQ

Measurements on E-UTRA cells on inter-frequency carriers and cells on IRAT frequencies with

higher cell reselection priority than the current frequency are always performed.

Measurements on E-UTRA cells on inter-frequency carriers and cells on IRAT frequencies with

equal or lower cell reselection priority than the current frequency are performed if one of

the following conditions apply for the serving cell:

- Srxlev ≤ SNonIntraSearchP
- Squal ≤ SNonIntraSearchQ

The UE does not need to perform the measurements if the following conditions apply:

- Srxlev&gt; SNonIntraSearchP
- Squal&gt; SNonIntraSearchQ

3GPP release 8 UEs do not support RSRQ-based cell reselection. For more information, see

3GPP TS 36.304.

### 3.2.4 Intra-Frequency and Equal Priority Cell Reselection

When camped on an E-UTRA cell, the UE performs a ranking of neighbor E-UTRA cells on

the same frequency and other frequencies with equal cell reselection priority. Whether the cells

satisfy the cell selection criteria is also considered.

The cell ranking is based on the RSRP measurement quantities of the serving cell

(Qmeas,s) and the neighbor cells (Qmeas,n).

The UE applies the cell ranking criterion Rs on the serving cell and the cell

ranking criterion Rn on the intra-frequency and equal priority cells:

- Rs = Qmeas,s + Qhyst
- Rn = Qmeas,n - QOffset

| Qhyst   |    | A hysteresis value preventing too frequent reselection back and forth between cells of             nearly equal rank.                                                                                                                            |
|---------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| QOffset |    | An offset in the cell ranking criterion of neighbor E-UTRA cells. It consists of a cell             individual part and a frequency specific part. The frequency-specific part applies to             equal priority inter-frequency cells only. |

When a neighbor cell is ranked as better than the serving cell that is,

Rn&gt; Rs, during a time interval

TreselectionEUTRA, the UE performs a cell reselection to the better-ranked cell.

The configuration parameters to set intra-frequency and equal priority inter-frequency cell

ranking criteria are described in Table 4.

### 3.2.5 Priority-Based Cell Reselection

Priority-based cell reselection can be applied when multiple E-UTRA or IRAT

frequencies are used in any combination.

The UE can access the following system information in the cell where the UE is camping:

- Information on the available E-UTRA and IRAT frequencies
- Cell reselection priorities
- Threshold values for cell reselection

The UE behavior depends on the cell reselection priorities of those frequencies.

The UE only performs cell reselection evaluation for the E-UTRA and IRAT frequencies

that are given in system information and for which a cell reselection priority is provided.

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.304.

If the UE finds an inter-frequency carrier or an IRAT frequency with a cell reselection

priority higher than the frequency where the UE is camping, the UE attempts to reselect a cell

on that frequency. Cell reselection occurs if the UE finds a cell with either an

Srxlev value greater than the threshXHigh value or an

Squal value greater than the value of threshXHighQ struct

member of SIB3 for that frequency. The criterion used depends on whether the

struct member threshServingLowQ is included in SIB3.

The UE does not perform cell reselection to NR or UTRAN FDD cells for which the cell selection

criterion S is not fulfilled. The cell selection criterion is fulfilled

if:Srxlev&gt; 0 AND Squal&gt; 0,

which means RSRP and RSRQ measurement are both needed besides the

threshServingLowQ for these cases. For more information, see 3GPP

TS 36.304.

If the UE finds an inter-frequency carrier with equal priority to the frequency where the UE

is camping, the UE performs cell reselection much in the same way as intra-frequency cell

reselection.

UE camping in E-UTRA is not required to evaluate an equal priority IRAT frequency.

Configuration of equal cell reselection priority of IRAT frequencies are to be avoided. The UE

behavior is undefined.

The UE attempts to reselect a cell on an inter-frequency carrier or an IRAT frequency with

cell reselection priority lower than the frequency where the UE is camping if either of the

following conditions apply:

- The Srxlev value of the serving cell falls below the EUtranCellFDD.threshServingLowor the EUtranCellTDD.threshServingLow value.
- The Squal value of the serving cell falls below the threshServingLowQ value

Cell reselection occurs if the UE finds a cell with either an Srxlev value

greater than the EUtranFreqRelation.threshXLow value or an Squal

value greater than the EUtranFreqRelation.threshXLowQ value for that

frequency. The criterion used depends on whether the threshServingLowQ

struct member is included in SIB3.

The UE does not perform cell reselection to NR or UTRAN FDD cells for which the cell selection

criterion S is not fulfilled. The cell selection criterion is fulfilled

if:Srxlev&gt; 0 AND Squal&gt; 0,

which means RSRP and RSRQ measurement are both needed besides the

threshServingLowQ for these cases. For more information, see 3GPP

TS 36.304.

If the threshServingLowQ struct member is included in SIB3, the qQualMin parameter, the required minimum RSRQ level

### 3.2.6 Speed-Dependent Scaling of Cell Reselection Criteria

The speed-dependent scaling of cell reselection criteria is used to influence the cell

reselection criteria for fast moving UE. It helps the UE to respond more quickly to cell changes

when moving at high speed.

The UE can enter one of the following mobility states:

- Normal-mobility state
- Medium-mobility state
- High-mobility state

The usual TreselectionEUTRA and Qhyst parameters are used in

Normal-mobility state for the evaluation of cell reselection criteria.

In Medium- and High-mobility states, the UE applies a scaling factor, decreasing the value of

the TreselectionEUTRA parameter. This way reducing the evaluation period of cell

reselection criteria.

In addition, a negative offset is added to the Qhyst hysteresis value in the cell ranking criteria. It lowers the threshold

for the reselection of intra-frequency cells.

The criteria for the UE to enter Medium- and High-mobility states are based on the number of

recent cell reselections performed by the UE. A sliding time window is used. The

TCRmax parameter determines the duration of the sliding time window.

The NCR\_M, that is, medium-mobility and NCR\_H, that is, high-mobility

parameters determine the number of cell reselections the UE performs within the sliding time

window to enter Medium- and High-mobility states. The UE applies an extra time period before

reentering Normal-mobility state.

Once in Medium-mobility state or High-mobility state, the UE re-enters Normal-mobility state

when the number of cell reselections during the sliding time window (TCRmax) stays

below the NCR\_M and NCR\_H parameter values during a period equal to the

additional time period.

The TCRmaxHyst parameter determines the duration of

the additional time period. The configuration parameters to set speed-dependent

scaling of cell reselection criteria are specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 and described in Table 6 and Table 7.

### 3.2.7 Cell Barring and Cell Reservation

Cell barring and cell reservation for operator use are two conditions that can be

configured to exclude a cell as a candidate for cell reselection.

The UE is not allowed to select or reselect a cell configured as barred. The UE is allowed to

select or reselect another cell on the same frequency, if the cell selection or reselection

criteria for the other cell are fulfilled.

The UE excludes a cell from the candidate list for 5 minutes after it has determined the cell

is barred. Similarly, if a cell is configured as reserved for operator use, the UE considers

the cell is barred, unless the following conditions apply:

- The UE belongs to access classes 11 or 15.
- The UE operates in its home PLMN or an equivalent home PLMN.

For more information, see 3GPP TS 23.122.

If these conditions apply, the cell is considered configured as reserved for operator use, as

any other cell. The UE can treat the cell as a candidate for cell reselection. The

configuration parameters to set the cell barring and cell reservation in the cell are

described in Table 8.

Table 8   Parameters for Cell Barring and Cell Reservation

| Parameter                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.cellBarred     EUtranCellTDD.cellBarred                   | Specifies whether the cell is barred and not accessible by UE.                                                                                              |
| EUtranCellFDD.primaryPlmnReserved     EUtranCellTDD.primaryPlmnReserved | Specifies whether the primary PLMN identity in the cell is reserved for operator                 use, that is, for UE belonging to access classes 11 or 15. |

### 3.2.8 Using the Excludelist

The UE does not consider cells on the excludelist as a candidate for cell reselection

in RRC idle mode. Information on excluded cells can be provided to the UE in SIB4 for

intra-frequency neighbor relations and in SIB5 for inter-frequency neighbor

relations.

The range of neighbor cells to be included on the excludelist can be configured with the

EUtranFreqRelation.blackListEntryIdleMode attribute. This

attribute defines the content of the intraFreqExcludedCellList IE in SIB4

or the interFreqExcludedCellList IE in SIB5. If the list of cells to be

excluded is configured with the

EUtranFreqRelation.blackListEntryIdleMode attribute, the values

configured for the following attributes do not affect the content of the excludelist:

- EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed
- EUtranCellRelation.includeInSystemInformation

For more information on using excludelists for cell reselection, see 3GPP TS

36.304.

The configuration of exludelists can be determined in terms of the corresponding

attributes and cell relations.

## 3.3 Tracking Area Update

The tracking area update procedure is used by the UE to update the registration of its

actual tracking in the network.

A Tracking Area is the set of E-UTRA cells in a PLMN, identified by a common TAC in the

system information. When a UE registers itself in the network, the core network stores

information about the tracking area where the registration is performed. This information is

used, for example, to assist the UE paging. For more information, see Paging.

The core network provides the UE with a list of tracking areas where the registration is

valid. The UE performs a new registration, either after a certain time (periodic registration)

or when it enters a new tracking area where the registration is no longer valid. The operator

configures the TAC associated with each cell. For more information, see the following

documentation:

- Manage Radio Network
- Manage Bearers and Services

## 3.4 Access Class Barring

Access class restrictions are conditions that can be configured to prevent the UE from

performing certain types of access in the cell.

Access class restrictions are based on the following conditions:

- Access class to which the UE belongs
- Type of access to be performed

Access class restrictions take effect when the UE leaves idle mode and performs the RRC

connection establishment procedure to enter connected mode. If access is prevented because of

access class restrictions, the UE considers the cell to be temporarily restricted for initial

access and it ends the intended RRC connection establishment procedure. The UE remains in idle

mode.

### 3.4.1 Definition of Access Classes

The access class of the UE is stored on the USIM. This information is tied to the

mobile subscription.

All UEs with a USIM are members of one of 10 randomly allocated classes, defined as access

classes 0-9.

In addition, a UE can be a member of one or more of the five special categories, defined as

access classes 11-15.

In accordance with 3GPP TS 22.011, the following access classes allocated to

specific user categories:

- Class 15: PLMN staff
- Class 14: Emergency Services
- Class 13: Public Utilities
- Class 12: Security Services
- Class 11: For PLMN Use

Access class 10 is an independent class especially designed for emergency calls barring. It

enables network access control if emergency calls are allowed for UEs with access classes 0-9

or without an IMSI. For UEs with access classes 11-15, emergency calls are not allowed if both

access class 10 and any of the relevant access classes 11-15 are barred. Otherwise, emergency

calls are allowed.

Access classes 0-9 apply in any home or visited PLMN. Access classes 11 and 15 apply to the

home PLMN and any equivalent home PLMN. Access classes 12-14 apply to any home PLMN or visited

PLMN in the home country of the mobile subscription. The home country is defined by the Mobile

Country Code (MCC) part of the IMSI. The IMSI is stored on the USIM.

### 3.4.2 Access Class Barring Information

The right to perform certain types of access in the cell is controlled by the access

class restriction information broadcast in system information (SIB type 2). It applies to mobile

originating access.

The access class restriction information distinguishes mobile originating access to initiate

the following connections:

- An emergency call
- A connection for signaling
- A connection for user data
- A connection for service-specific access

Configuring the parameter (struct) AcBarringPresence

(EUtranCellFDD.AcBarringPresence or

EUtranCellTDD.AcBarringPresence) allows configuring the presence of

barring factor information into the SIB2 message, for any of the following signaling types

(struct members):

- acBarringForMoSignPresence
- acBarringForMoDataPresence
- acBarringForCsfbPresence
- acBarringForMmtelVoicePresence (Progressive Access Barring feature only)
- acBarringForMmtelVideoPresence (Progressive Access Barring feature only)

The following configurations exist for the presence:

- OFF
- MANUAL
- AUTO

When the presence of a signaling type is set to OFF, the access

class       restriction information is not added to the SIB2 message. When the presence is set to

MANUAL, the configured access class restriction information is added to the

SIB2. When the presence is set to AUTO, the Load-Based Access Barring

feature, the Progressive Access Barring, or the PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature is

activated automatically when the system becomes congested. The barring factor is recalculated

periodically and advertised to the UEs in the SIB2 message until the system is not congested.

Then the Load-Based Access Barring feature, the Progressive Access Barring, or the

PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature is disabled.

Table 11 shows which configuration requires adding

the barring factor to the SIB2 message.

### 3.4.3 Emergency Call Barring

Emergency call barring restricts the UE in establishing emergency calls in the

cell.

Emergency call barring is configured if the access class restriction information is present

in the system information and the emergency call barring in the cell is set to the value

true.

When emergency calls are barred, UE is not allowed to establish emergency calls in the cell.

The only exceptions are UE belonging to a special access class 11-15.

The UE can establish emergency calls if the following conditions apply:

- The access class restriction information for mobile originating data is present in the system information.
- The sending of mobile-originating data is not restricted for the special access class to which the UE belongs.

When emergency calls are allowed in the cell, any UE can establish emergency calls, including

UE without a USIM (that is, UE without an IMSI) and UE in the camped on any

cell state.

| Parameter                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### 3.4.4 Access Class Barring Control

Access class restrictions are applied separately for signaling and mobile-originating

user data. If the applicable access class restriction information is not present, access

class     restrictions do not apply.

When access class restrictions are applied for the special access classes 11-15, the network

indicates if access to the cell is restricted or unrestricted for each access class. If the UE

belongs to one of the special access classes 11-15 and the access to the cell for that access

class is unrestricted, the UE can establish RRC connection and does not consider the access

class restriction for access classes 0-9.

When access class restriction is applied for access classes 0-9, the network indicates a

probability factor for granting access to the cell. The UE performs a random draw and if the

result is less than the indicated probability factor, access is granted and the UE can

establish the RRC connection. Otherwise, access to the cell is restricted, preventing the UE

from establishing the RRC connection.

When access class restrictions deny access to a cell, the UE considers

the cell as restricted for further access during a randomized back-off

time. The average back-off time is indicated in system information.

The UE applies an actual back-off time, which is randomly distributed

with equal probability within ± 30% of the indicated average.

If the UE reselects another cell during the back-off time, the access class restrictions and

the back-off time from the previous cell are cleared and the UE can attempt access in the new

cell.

Access class restrictions do not apply to mobile-terminating user data. However, if access to

the cell is prohibited because of a previous attempt to send signaling or mobile-originating

user data, the restriction during the back-off time applies also to mobile terminating user

data.

The configuration parameters in the AcBarringConfig struct are described

in Table 14.

Access Class Barring Information

### 3.4.5 Enable Access Class Barring

Steps

1. Configure the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringInfoPresent or the EUtranCellTDD.acBarringInfoPresent parameter. Result: The eNodeB includes the system information modification parameter EUtranCellFDD.ChangeNotification or EUtranCellTDD.ChangeNotification in the next paging message. The UEs in idle mode use this indication as a trigger to read the next SIB. The eNodeB then broadcasts the access class restriction parameters in SIB2 to the UEs in idle mode. The UEs configured with access classes must test for access barring using the latest access restriction parameters when requesting access to the cell. For more information about System Information, see the following documents: Manage Radio Network Manage Bearers and Services For more information about message contents, see the following documents: 3GPP TS 36.300 3GPP TS 36.331
    - Set the parameter to FALSE to disable the access class restriction functionality.
    - Set the parameter to TRUE to enable the access class restriction functionality.

### 3.4.6 Service Specific Access Control

SSAC allows access control for telephony services (MMTEL) for mobile-originating

session requests from idle mode.

Service Specific Access Control is made possible with the broadcast of SSAC parameters for

MMTEL voice and MMTEL video in SIB2. The SSAC procedure performed by the UE is based on

3GPP TS 22.011.

### 3.4.7 Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring

Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring functionality enables the possibility to

prioritize VoLTE traffic by allowing UEs to skip access class barring check when moving to

connected mode because of establishing a VoLTE service.

To enable the prioritization of VoLTE traffic, access class barring check is skipped by

adding indicators in SIB2, if Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring is enabled. One

indicator is added for each of the following service types:

- IMS Voice
- IMS Video
- SMS

For more information, see Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring.

# 4 Network Impact of Idle Mode Support

The feature affects network coverage and adds new IEs to the SIB2 message.

Capacity and Performance

The configuration of the Idle Mode Support feature affects the subjective network coverage.

Defining the cell selection criterion determines the area where the UE considers the cells

of the network to be suitable for camping and where the UE can expect to receive normal

service.

Interfaces

Depending on the configuration, access class barring information is added to the SIB2

message.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Idle Mode Support

This feature introduces attributes specifying information in SIB messages.

To include SIB3, an EUtranFreqRelation MO instance must be

created which refers to a EUtranFrequency.arfcnValueEUtranDl

attribute set to the same value as the

EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl or

EUtranCellTDD.earfcndl attribute.

# 6 Performance of Idle Mode Support

The feature is part of LTE Basic and has no directly associated KPIs, counters, and

events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
