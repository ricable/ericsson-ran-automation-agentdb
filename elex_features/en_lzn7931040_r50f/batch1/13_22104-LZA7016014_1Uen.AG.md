# 1 Antenna System Monitoring Overview

With the Antenna System Monitoring feature, failing or incorrectly placed antennas can

be discovered and then corrected to achieve high gain.

Summary

When using multiple antenna techniques in a wireless communication system such as RX

diversity, TX diversity, or MIMO, the antennas must align to achieve the expected

gain. Problems with the antenna affect the quality of the mobile system.

If the feeders are installed incorrectly at multiple antenna installation, it leads to low

antenna performance. Drive testing is used to discover and correct such errors,

which can be expensive.

The Antenna System Monitoring feature detects misaligned orientation of antennas based on

measurements of the received signal from the UE. Both slowly failing and incorrectly

mounted antenna systems are discovered.

Antenna System Monitoring provides indications of potential antenna-related problems,

such as the following:

- Misaligned antennas, orientation, and tilt.
- Swapped antenna feeders.
- Disconnected or loose antenna feeders.

The benefits of the Antenna System Monitoring feature are the following:

| Benefit                           | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Remote problem identification.    | Several common types of antenna problems can be detected from 										a remote site, which reduces the need for site visits and 										drive testing. |
| More effective problem solutions. | If an expected problem is known, it is possible to prepare in 										advance before a site visit.                                                       |
| Remote solution verification.     | The implemented solution can be verified from a remote 										site.                                                                                     |

# 3 Feature Operation of Antenna System Monitoring

## 3.1 Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

The Antenna System Monitoring feature enables remote antenna monitoring to achieve

expected antenna performance.

Steps

1. The RBS measures the uplink SINR for each antenna and user.
2. The difference of the SINR between each pair of receiver antennas is calculated and the corresponding counters are stepped.
3. In the on-node solution, SINR measurements are processed locally on the node. The node calculates the mean and standard deviation, from which the conclusion and the level of reliability are determined and presented. When required, an alarm is raised by the Baseband Radio Node. Note: The trigger thresholds for alarms can be configured. For more information about threshold setting, see Collect and Analyze Counters with Baseband Radio Node. In the off-node solution, the OSS and ENIQ collect the counter values. The Find Faulty Antenna Expert for LTE feature in ENIQ is used to calculate the mean and standard deviation. From these values, the conclusion and the level of reliability are determined and presented. When required, an alarm is raised in the OSS. The ENIQ report makes it possible to identify the issues listed below. Additionally, if a sufficient number of samples are present in the collection period, ENIQ raises faults when specific errors are detected. No failure Misaligned Swapped Disconnected RF Path Losses

## 3.2 Process Steps

### 3.2.1 Measurement

Layer 1 measures the SINR from each antenna for active users in the sector. To illustrate the

principle, Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3

show a beam coverage top view of three different example scenarios for the antenna

alignment.

Figure 1   Two Antenna Beams Well Aligned in Sector 0

Figure 2   Two Antenna Beams Misaligned in Sector 0

Figure 3   Two Antennas in Sector 0, with One Antenna Incorrectly Connected to Sector 2

If the two antennas are not aligned for the UE in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 , the SINR varies depending on the location of the UE

in the sector. Normally both UEs receive high SINR from both antennas. If the antennas are

misaligned, a UE, which is mainly covered by only one antenna, receives high SINR from which

antenna and low SINR from the other antenna.

In Figure 4, Normal case refers to Figure 1, Misaligned case to Figure 2, and Swapped case to Figure 3.

Figure 4   Received Signal SINR for UE 0 and UE 1, from Antennas 0 and

1 in Sector 0

### 3.2.2 Calculation and Stepping of Counters

The difference in SINR from each pair of antennas is calculated

and the corresponding counters are stepped every reporting interval.

The mean and standard deviation of the resulting distribution are

used to determine if the antenna alignment or the antenna installation

causes a problem.

### 3.2.3 Collect and Analyze Counters

The OSS collects the counters from the RBS. If ENIQ is integrated with OSS, it can be used to

analyze the counters and determine if any fault condition exists. For more information about

Find Faulty Antenna - LTE in ENIQ, see the Ericsson Network IQ document Find Faulty Antenna (FFAX-LTE) User Guide.

### 3.2.4 Collect and Analyze Counters with ENIQ

The Operations Support Systems (OSS) and Ericsson Network IQ (ENIQ) collect the counter

values, while the Find Faulty Antenna feature in ENIQ can be used to calculate the mean

and standard deviation. From these values, the conclusion and the level of reliability

are determined and presented when required.

The following alarms are raised in the OSS to indicate possible problems: issued when

average absolute value of the difference between a specific pair of RX branches is

higher than 17 dB.

The minimum number of measurements to be collected must contain the following

information:

- Differences between FDD and TDD
- Low traffic conditions
- Possibility of temporarily disabled cells and sectors

### 3.2.5 Collect and Analyze Counters with Baseband Radio Node

The Baseband Radio Node collects the counter values, and when a sufficient number of

samples is collected, they are used to calculate the mean and standard deviation. From

these values, the conclusion and the level of reliability are determined and presented

when required.

The following alarms are raised by a Baseband Radio Node to indicate possible

problems:

- The RX Branch Imbalance Fault alarm is raised when the average absolute value of the difference between a specific pair of RX branches is between 8 dB and 17 dB.
- The RX Diversity Lost alarm is raised if the difference between a specific pair of RX branches is higher than 17 dB.

The thresholds for triggering the

RX

Branch Imbalance

Fault

and the

RX

Diversity

Lost

alarms can be configured through the

ENodeBFunction.rxBranchImbalanceThreshold and the

ENodeBFunction.rxDiversityLostThreshold attributes.

The ENodeBFunction.rxBranchImbalanceThreshold attribute is used to set the

threshold for triggering

the

RX

Branch Imbalance

Fault

alarm. The attribute can be set to a value between 4 dB and 10 dB. The default value of

the attribute is 8 dB.

The ENodeBFunction.rxDiversityLostThreshold attribute is used to set

the threshold for triggering the RX Diversity Lost alarm.

The value of the attribute can be set between 15 dB and 19 dB. The default value of the

attribute is 17 dB.

The minimum number of measurements to be collected must contain the following

information:

- Differences between FDD and TDD
- Low traffic conditions
- Possibility of temporarily disabled cells and sectors

### 3.2.6 Fault Detection

The following conditions must apply to detect faults:

- The ASM feature is activated.
- No alarms are raised.
- The cells or TRXs are UNLOCKED and ENABLED.
- Sectors are UNLOCKED and ENABLED.
- The following attributes in the RfPort MO must be set according the following: The administrativeState attribute set to UNLOCKED. The operationalState attribute set to ENABLED. The availabilityStatus attribute set to NoStatus.
- The ENodeBFunction.antSysMonitoringAlarmHandling attribute must be set to true.

When activated, the ASM feature constantly provides monitoring for antenna systems based

on the uplink measurements of the RX paths and branches. The gathered data is measured

in every 24 hours for potential problems. If there is not enough data to measure, for

example due to low traffic, the gathering continues for another 24 hours.

The following problems can be detected by the feature:

- RF loss
- Mismatched antennas
- Swapped feeders
- Disconnected feeders

If a problem is detected, one of the following alarms is raised based on the gathered

data:

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Antenna System Monitoring

There are multiple configurations for the Antenna System Monitoring feature to

achieve expected gain and to monitor antenna-related problems.

Antenna System Monitoring counters are defined for each sector carrier. In

one sector, the antennas or antenna branches can be paired in configurations of either

two, four, or eight antennas. Antennas are indexed inside a sector and are ordered by

polarization. All antennas of the same polarization are listed and all antennas of

orthogonal polarization are listed. For more information, see Quad Antenna Uplink Performance Package. For example, if the

sector has an antenna configuration of four, there are three antenna pairs as

illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5   Antenna System Monitoring in a Quad-Antenna Configuration.

The pmBranchDeltaSinrDistr0 counter corresponds to

Delta0 in Figure 6. This

counter is for the difference of the measurements SINR-A and SINR-B in antenna pair 0.

The difference of measurements is used to detect if antenna pair 0 has an

antenna-related problem. The pmBranchDeltaSinrDistr1 counter is used

for antenna pair 1, and so on.

In an octal-antenna configuration which has eight antenna branches and seven antenna

pairs, all counters in Figure 6 are pegged. In a

quad-antenna configuration, which has four antennas and three antenna pairs, the

pmBranchDeltaSinrDistr0 ,

pmBranchDeltaSinrDistr1 and

pmBranchDeltaSinrDistr2 counters are pegged. In a dual-antenna

configuration, which has one antenna pair, pmBranchDeltaSinrDistr0 is

pegged.

The other counters in Figure 6 are PDF counters that

store the difference in SINR measurements as a distribution for the ROP (Result Output

Period).

During the L1 (Layer 1) measurement, the SINR is measured for each

PUSCH channel relative to each antenna branch. The difference

between the branches is calculated for each antenna pair. This measurement is repeated

every subframe TTI, or every several subframes.

The reporting interval is 60 seconds. The PDF counter for each antenna pair is updated

with the new L1 measurement. After each ROP, the OSS and the Baseband Radio Node in the

on-node solution collect the resulting delta SINR distribution for each antenna pair.

The maximum number of samples in one ROP (15 minutes) is of the order 1000×60×15 per

sector for each PDF counter.

Each such PDF counter pmBranchDeltaSinrDistrX has a distribution range

as indicated in Figure 6.
