Summary

The IP Loopback Interface feature provides the use of one source address for all traffic.

This is useful for management purposes, as it prevents packets being assigned different

source addresses depending on the used port. Using this feature, the IP loopback interface

can be configured for IPv4 and IPv6 addressed interfaces.

# 3 Feature Operation of IP Loopback Interface

This feature provides virtual interfaces with IP addresses independent from physical

interfaces.

Figure 1   Operation of IP Loopback Interface

An IP loopback interface provides an IP termination point that is not associated with a

particular physical interface. Traffic to and from the IP loopback interface can be routed

through alternative physical interfaces.

IP loopback interfaces can be configured on the node. The IP address assigned to one of these

interfaces (loopback address) can be used as a common source address for all IP traffic

sent.

One or more neighboring routers are used to carry traffic along alternative paths to the IP

loopback interface. Each of these routers needs to install a route to the IP loopback

interface, using one of the external IP interfaces of the node as next-hop. Connectivity of

this route can be monitored with BFD. BFD detects a loss of connectivity.

When using resilient static routes, it is recommended that internal applications (for example

O&amp;M and packet relay) use IP loopback interfaces, with IP addresses independent from

physical interfaces.

# 4 Parameters for IP Loopback Interface

This feature introduces attributes related to IP loopback interface.

Table 1   Parameters

| Parameter              | Type       | Description          |
|------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| InterfaceIPv4.loopback | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 5 Network Impact of IP Loopback Interface

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

# 6 Performance of IP Loopback Interface

This feature has no directly associated KPIs or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

There are counters associated with this feature. More information can be found in Managed Object Model (MOM).

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
