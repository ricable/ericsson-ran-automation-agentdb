| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                          |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                                |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                         |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

The Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature improves retainability for eNodeBs in

high-load conditions and for UEs in poor radio conditions.

This feature dynamically increases and optimizes the poll interval based on current

bearer conditions. This feature reduces unnecessary poll-retransmissions, and

extends the time to declare RLF in downlink without affecting the poll behavior for

other UEs.

Additional Information

For detailed information about the configuration of the feature, see Manage Bearers and Services.

## 3.2 Dynamic Load Control Overview

This feature improves throughput and retainability in congested cells by gradually

adjusting the admitted traffic.

| Feature Name           | Dynamic Load Control                                                        |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 3083                                                                |
| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                          |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                         |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

The Dynamic Load Control feature improves throughput and retainability in congested

cells by gradually adjusting the admitted traffic.

This can also improve accessibility, whereas the Procedure Latency Supervision

function of the Basic Load Management feature completely blocks all traffic.

Privileged access, such as EA and HPA, are always allowed to connect, regardless of

the Dynamic Load Control feature.

## 3.3 Dynamic Random Access Backoff Overview

This feature improves the random access success rate, and decreases inter-cell

interference and connection latency for the UEs connecting to the eNodeB.

| Feature Name           | Dynamic Random Access Backoff                                              |

| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Dynamic Random Access Backoff feature has the following benefits:

- Improved inter-cell interference
- Improved Random Access success rate
- Lower latency for UEs connecting to the eNodeB to reacquire uplink synchronization
- Lower latency for UEs connecting to the eNodeB to request an uplink grant using the Scheduling Request Random Access Channel when the random access load is high

It is possible to observe potential benefits of the feature without activating it in

the following way:

- The introduced EUtranCellFDD.pmRaBackoffDistr or EUtranCellTDD.pmRaBackoffDistr PM counters are always populated, even if the license is not activated. By observing the distribution of the Random Access backoff value, an indication of the benefits of feature activation can be obtained.
- A distribution of the Random Access backoff value that significantly deviates from zero indicates that activation of this feature is beneficial.

Additional Information

For more information and related topics, see 3GPP TS 36.321 Medium Access

Control (MAC) protocol specification.

## 3.4 Dynamic UE Admission Control Overview

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature greatly improves retainability, UE

throughput, and eNodeB stability in certain overloaded scenarios by differentiating and

rejecting incoming requests to be admitted in the cell.

| Feature Name           | Dynamic UE Admission Control                                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4301                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature has the following benefits:

- Retainability KPIs are increased during overloaded situations because of the reduced number of RLFs.
- Risk is reduced that admitted UEs cannot be properly served according to QCI parameters (minimum bit rate, maximum waiting time, delay) because of the overload.
- The DRB-SRB traffic ratio is kept high during overloaded situations because of less signaling caused by the establishment or reestablishment of the radio links.

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature introduces several new PM counters and

updated events that provide details of MSR load utilization. This information can be

useful to plan expansions or capacity constraints, and to set up and tune the

admission thresholds.

The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature offers admission control in the following

different places where UEs are entering the node:

- UEs requesting a connection establishment by sending the RRC Connection Request message to the eNodeB over the radio interface
- UEs requesting a connection reestablishment, for example after RLF, by sending the RRC Reestablishment Request message to the eNodeB over the radio interface
- UEs subject to handover from another cell on the same node (intra-node handover) or another eNodeB (inter-node handover)

Each decision on whether to accept or reject a UE depends on the current load in the

system and the configured thresholds. One threshold is employed for RRC connection

requests and a second threshold for reestablishment and handovers.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.5 Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access Overview

The feature introduces a third threshold within the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature. Above this threshold, all UE requests, including Privileged Access (PA)

requests are immediately rejected or queued.

| Feature Name           | Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5229                                                                                       |
| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                                                 |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                                                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                                                |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                                                |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                 node. |

Summary

By activating the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

feature, PA is also considered when the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature

compares the total load against the introduced third threshold. If the total load is

above the third threshold, all admission requests, including PA user requests, are

immediately rejected or queued instead. After a period, the queued requests can be

admitted or rejected depending on the availability of system resources.

The Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature has the

following benefits:

- Increased retainability KPIs during overloaded situations
- Increased integrity KPIs during overloaded situations
- Reduced risk that admitted PA UEs cannot be properly served according to the QCI parameters (minimum bit rate, maximum waiting time, delay) because of overload

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature allows for the efficient use of the PDCCH

resources while ensuring the quality-of-service requirements.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved system capacity because of an increased number of scheduled users for each TTI, especially for voice (VoLTE or PTT) traffic
- Better control and monitoring of the PDCCH error rate
- Better voice quality because of the independent control of the VoLTE uplink PDCCH error rate

## 3.7 Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access Overview

The feature enables the admission of HPA and emergency call users into the cell

respective of the reserved resources and enables inter-cell UE preemption

in a congestion situation.

| Feature Name           | Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5490                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature allows the operator to reserve a share of cell-level UE resources for HPA

and emergency call users, depending on the configuration. The system reserves

cell-level UE resources for Privileged Access (PA), so that it can control the

number of users with non-privileged access in the cell.

The introduction of the feature does not change the maximum cell-level UE capacity

for HPA users. The cell-level UE capacity for non-privileged access and emergency

call users is lowered depending on the configuration of the HPA pool and the PA

reservation pool.

Inter-cell UE preemption is initiated when UE preemption is

unsuccessful in the cell where the UE with preemption authority requests admission,

and there is UE congestion on the eNodeB or the Baseband level.

This feature has the following benefits:

- If configured, HPA users have reserved resources, and their accessibility and mobility success rate increases.
- If configured, HPA and emergency call users have reserved PA resources, and their accessibility and mobility success rate increases. When the Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access feature is not activated, the full cell capacity is available for all users.
- If inter-cell UE preemption is configured, the admission rate of HPA and emergency call users improves.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.8 Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load Overview

## 3.9 Load-Based Access Barring Overview

The Load-Based Access Barring feature protects already established bearers in

high-load situations to ensure that severe performance degradation does not

occur.

| Feature Name           | Load-Based Access Barring                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 3093                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

At high levels of offered traffic, the number of access attempts can become too

large, overloading the eNodeB or the air interface control channels that cannot be

resolved by other load-handling features. The feature increases the chance that

prioritized users who belong to access classes 10-15, for example, public safety and

emergency calls, can always enter the network, even during overload conditions.

Certain users and emergency calls are prioritized based on the access class concept

defined in 3GPP. The following high-priority users are defined:

- Users that belong to access class 10 and perform emergency access calls.
- Users that belong to access class 11-15 and perform high priority access calls.
- Users that perform mobile-originating CSFB calls.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature enables decoupling the PDCCH outer loop link adaptation scheme into

uplink and downlink

processes.

With decoupling, PDCCH outer loop adjustment is improved if DTX is caused by PUSCH or

PUCCH. Decoupling the uplink and downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation helps to

avoid unnecessary reduction of PDCCH uplink or downlink SINR.

The feature can also replace uplink PDCCH

outer

loop link adaptation with downlink PDCCH

outer

loop link adaptation if the DTX difference exceeds the threshold

set by the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres attribute.

If the PDCCH downlink DTX rate is higher than the PDCCH uplink DTX rate, downlink DTX

can be limited for decreasing downlink PDCCH SINR.

This feature has the following benefits:

- PDCCH outer loop link adaptation is improved.
- Interference of the uplink and downlink PDCCH is avoided.
- The CCE aggregation level is optimized.
- PDCCH congestion might be prevented.

on a threshold configured for the subscription ratio in the cell. If the

subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the configured

threshold, the selected high-priority users are handled by the Subscriber Triggered

Mobility feature. If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the

configured threshold, the selected high-priority users can be handled by the

following features, if the features are activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

## 3.12 LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold Overview

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature allows for the automatic adjustment of the uplink RLC retransmission

threshold in congested cells to reduce uplink RLC buffer use.

When a single cell uses more than the allowed percentage of total RLC buffer

capacity, the uplink RLC retransmission threshold is automatically lowered to reduce

congestion. If RLC buffer use drops, the uplink RLC retransmission threshold is

returned to the original value.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature introduces an algorithm for the automatic adjustment of the PDCCH BLER

target. The algorithm adjusts the BLER target with an increase or a decrease of 0.5%

in each measurement period defined by the

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchCongestMeasurePeriod or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchCongestMeasurePeriod attribute. The

calculation of the optimal BLER target is based on the following factors:

- Predefined minimum and maximum adjustment thresholds
- Rate of PDCCH congestion
- Rate of PRB use

During PDCCH congestion, this feature has the following benefits:

- Improved network performance
- Increased number of scheduled entities
- Increased PRB use
- Increased throughput

The outer loop adjustment uses the VoLTE BLER target and parameters for any UE using

VoLTE services. If the PDCCH outer loop adjustment is higher than the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchOuterLoopInitialAdjVolte or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchOuterLoopInitialAdjVolte attribute, the

initial value of the PDCCH outer loop adjustment must be set to the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchOuterLoopInitialAdjVolte or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchOuterLoopInitialAdjVolte attribute when

the bearer setup is VoLTE and MCPTT.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                 node. |

Summary

The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature introduces the call queuing

function. Connections that are about to be rejected by the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature due to overload are queued instead. This behavior facilitates UE

admission in the eNodeB on the cell level. The call queuing function enables

rejected calls to start reconnection before the blocking period of the Dynamic UE

Admission Control feature expires. The call queuing function protects the eNodeB

from being overloaded. Reconnection attempts for the queued calls are only allowed

at MSR updates during the blocking period of the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature.

The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature has the following benefits:

- Improved accessibility during overload periods
- Better and more stable resource use
- More responsive Dynamic UE Admission Control feature during dynamic MSR oscillations
- Higher chance for the UEs to be admitted faster by the system in high-load conditions

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

The Prioritized SR Scheduling feature prevents UEs from reaching the maximum number

of SR transmissions.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Retainability is improved because of reduced control signaling.
- Scheduler efficiency is improved as more resources are available for user data with less control signaling.
- Fairness is improved between UEs because SRs are served with absolute priority independently of which DRBs are configured in the UE.
- Inter-cell interference is improved because fewer SR transmissions are required before the scheduler allocates uplink resources to the UEs.
- The load on the RACH is reduced as UEs do not need to resort to the RACH to request uplink resources. A reduced load on the RACH improves the success rate and the accessibility of the Random Access procedure.

Summary

The Progressive Access Barring feature introduces three

different priority levels for the calculation of barring factors used for access

class             barring signaled in SIB2. It also introduces the possibility to map the following five

different traffic classes to any of the priority levels:

- Mobile Originating Data
- Mobile Originating Signaling
- CSFB
- MMTEL Voice
- MMTEL Video

It is possible to configure a traffic class to be barred never, so there is an

implicit fourth priority level. This means that they are given higher priority than

any traffic class that is mapped to the first three priority levels. In addition to

the five traffic classes above, the following traffic classes can be configured to

be barred never:

- SMS
- Access class 10-15, each can be individually configured to be barred always or never

## 3.22 UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction Overview

This feature allows for a reduction in signaling between the network and supported

UEs.

| Feature Name           | UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction                                            |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

Supported UEs can experience a reduction in battery consumption with this feature.

This feature builds on the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature.

This feature provides the following benefits for both the network and PFT-capable

UEs:

- PFT-capable UEs are able to stay in RRC connected mode for a longer time, compared to the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature. This reduces the frequency of switching between RRC connected and RRC idle modes.
- PFT-capable UEs can quickly obtain a scheduling request when moving from out-of-sync to in-sync provided by fast scheduling resource allocation. PFT-capable UEs can then decide to stay out-of-sync while bundling delay sensitive data. This occupies network resources for a shorter time.
- PFT-capable UEs are not required to acknowledge the reception of an RRC Connection Release message when they are out-of-sync and the RRC inactivity timer expires.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.23 Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs Overview

The Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs feature improves system

performance by limiting resources to unreachable UEs.

| Feature Name           | Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs                          |

| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs feature identifies scheduling

resources allocated to out-of-coverage UEs and releases them for reallocation in the

following ways:

- Prolonged periodic granting decreases the uplink DTX counter, therefore freeing up resources for other scheduling.
- Clearing data for bearers removes the need to schedule the queue of out-of-coverage UEs, which saves the time required to empty a long queue estimation. In this case the uplink DTX counter is decreased, which also releases scheduling resources.

The uplink throughput of the cell increases during high-load conditions when there

are many out-of-coverage UEs.

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Variable SR and CQI Periodicity feature has the following benefits:

- A lower number of PRBs are allocated on PUCCH for SR and CQI resource.
- Lower number of PRBs are allocated to PUCCH while the number of SR and CQI users stay the same.
- More SR and CQI resources can be allocated before the processing resource capacity of the Baseband unit becomes exhausted.
- Congestion is less on the BBM level for SR and CQI resources for the same number of SR and CQI users.
