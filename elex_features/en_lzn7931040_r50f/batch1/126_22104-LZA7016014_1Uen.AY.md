# 1 Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling Overview

Scheduling is a main function in the management of radio resources. The Downlink

Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature enables the allocation of spectrum parts to a user.

This can result in improved cell capacity and coverage.

Summary

The Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature enables allocating a certain part of the

spectrum to a user, based on several criteria.

In a wideband transmission as in LTE, the radio link quality varies over time, and also varies

within the frequencies of the transmission bandwidth. Figure 1 illustrates an example that

shows the realization of the variations. The frequency-dependent variations can

improve cell capacity and coverage when performing downlink scheduling for a

transmission to a UE.

Cell capacity and coverage can be improved by selectively scheduling the active UEs in

different parts of the band where their channel qualities are better. At a schedule

time instance, the Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature relies on

multi-user diversity in the frequency domain to provide cell edge and average cell

throughput improvements.

Figure 1   Channel Realization Example

When possible, the Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature provides

each user with time-frequency resources that are better than the average

channel quality.

Additional Information

More information about this feature and related topics can be found in the following

documentation:

- Scheduler
- 3GPP TS 36.331, TS 36.211, TS 36.212 and TS 36.213

# 2 Dependencies of Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature requires the QoS - Aware

Scheduler feature and is related to ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The performance of the Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature can be affected by the

accuracy of the measurement of UE on downlink channel. The reported sub-band channel

quality values still represent the actual channel condition at the time of the

downlink data transmissions.

The effectiveness of the feature is also limited by the quantization on the sub-band

channel quality report as described in 3GPP TS36.213, Section

7.2.1.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The QoS-Aware Scheduler feature license must be activated.

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature modifies the default Scheduler to

all resources based on frequency-selective channel quality information.

Operation Process

The process steps of the scheduling algorithm are based on the default scheduler, but the

following parameters cannot be used:

- EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart
- EUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart

If the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart or the

EUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart MO attribute must be used,

the Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature has to be deactivated.

## 3.1 Feature Operation Details

Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling means that the spectrum allocation decisions for

PDSCH transmissions are based on frequency-dependent channel knowledge. The frequency

awareness, introduced in the Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature, allows the

scheduler to prioritize which users should be scheduled during a certain time interval. It

also allows the scheduler to decide which spectrum resources should be allocated to each of

the users. Both time and frequency dimensions are taken into account when resource allocation

decisions are made.

The A-periodic CQI that reports from the UE on its measurement of the downlink channel is the

fundamental information used to facilitate Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling. See Figure 2. An A-periodic CQI report is sent on the PUSCH when

requested by the eNodeB. The report is requested when the UE has downlink data to be scheduled

and it contains both wideband and sub-band channel quality values.

Figure 2   CQI Reporting.

UE performs downlink channel measurement on the Reference symbols for CQI report.

By performing Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling, the downlink scheduler attempts to

maximize the spectral efficiency by scheduling each UE into a part of the spectrum where the

channel quality is better, based on the CQI report.

The Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature uses DCI message Format 1 for the

following transmission modes:

- Downlink transmission mode 1
- Downlink transmission mode 2
- Downlink transmission mode 7

The Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature uses DCI Format 2A, 2 and 2B for the

following transmission modes:

- Downlink transmission mode 3
- Downlink transmission mode 4
- Downlink transmission mode 8

Example 1   Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

Feature Operation

Figure 2 shows a possible

approach in scheduling three UEs.

Scheduling starts from the highest priority UE to

the lowest priority UE and resource allocation is limited to the UE sub-bands where the

channel quality measurement is higher. Sub-bands S5 and S6 have been allocated to UE2, so

UE3 can only get allocation for sub-bands S0 and S2.

To ensure allocation

effectiveness because of the overlap of UE sub-bands of higher quality, it is recommended to

have a larger number of UEs scheduled at one time.

Figure 3   UE Allocation Based on Frequency Selective Channel Quality Measurements

Interoperability with Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature is mutually operable with Flexible Channel Bandwidth. The eNodeB scheduler does not alter the CQI acquisition mechanisms.

However, in configurations limited by Flexible Channel Bandwidth, the eNodeB filters the available sub-bands. Filtering occurs on the basis

of the acquired set of CQI metrics for each sub-band of each cell.

## 3.2 Process Steps for Downlink Scheduling

1. At the beginning of each TTI, the Downlink Scheduler receives the following information:
    - List of available PRBs
    - Available downlink power in the cell
    - PDCCH resources
    - Logical channels with data to transmit
    - Estimate of current radio conditions (channel quality)
    - Number of OFDM symbols for user data
2. If resources are available, the Scheduler checks the Baseband capacity.
3. A UE to be scheduled is validated to ensure that it is available for receiving data and it is synchronized.
4. A UE to be scheduled is chosen based on the priority and scheduling weight of its radio bearers. As the Downlink Scheduler has full observability over all radio bearers (logical channels), it can determine the exact radio bearers that transmit data in one subframe.
5. If the Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature is activated and predefined conditions are satisfied, remaining scheduling procedures can be skipped on that TTI. For more information, see Low Energy Scheduler Solution.
6. If a UE is validated, the Scheduler assigns an appropriate number of PRBs to the UE. PRBs are allocated from lower frequencies to higher, that is from left to right. The proportion of the downlink bandwidth used by the downlink Scheduler can be configured using MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion. The allocation can start anywhere within the available range, and wraps around if reaching the end of the range. When ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation is enabled in downlink, using MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive or EUtranCellTDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive, the starting location of the PRB for resource allocation is ignored. However, the proportion of the downlink bandwidth to be used by the downlink scheduler specified by the EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion MO attribute is still respected. When ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation is disabled in downlink, the manually specified starting location of the physical resource block configured with the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute or theEUtranCellTDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute is ignored, but the proportion of the downlink bandwidth to be used by the downlink scheduler specified by the EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion or EUtranCellTDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion parameter is still respected. Note: Using only a fraction of downlink bandwidth can affect downlink peak throughput and capacity negatively. For more information, see ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation.
7. The downlink Scheduler receives reports on CQI as feedback on channel quality. The CQI is sent in uplink on PUCCH or PUSCH. PUSCH provides reports with high frequency for each sub-band when there is data to transmit. PUCCH gives wide band average reports with low frequency to track pathloss when there is no data to transmit to the UE. The number of CQI resources available on the PUCCH can be configured with MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers or EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers.

# 4 Network Impact of Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature is allocating parts of a spectrum

to a user, which can have a positive impact on capacity and coverage. The allocation process

enables a more efficient distribution of network resources.

Capacity and Performance

The frequency awareness, introduced in the Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

feature, allows the scheduler to prioritize which users need to be scheduled during

a certain time interval. The feature also allows the scheduler to decide which

spectrum resources need to be allocated to each of the users. Both time and

frequency dimensions are considered when resource allocation decisions are made. The

Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature provides coverage improvement with

transmitting on sub-bands that have better quality when serving cell edge users.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.
