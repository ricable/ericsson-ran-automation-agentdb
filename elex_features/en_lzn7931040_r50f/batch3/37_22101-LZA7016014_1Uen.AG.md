# 2 Benefits of IPv6

The extended address space of IPv6 allows the operator to do the following:

- Handling the growing amount of nodes in the transport network
- Planning IP addresses simpler
- Minimizing the risk of IP overlapping

Migration towards IPv6 only networks (application + S1/X2/OAM + fixed)

simplifies

the following:

- Routing tables
- Network configuration
- Troubleshooting

IPv6

Extended

Address

Space

IPv6 uses

128-bit addresses (16-byte).

In

the transport network, IPv6 enables the operator to have more

addresses

to connect

the

growing number of

nodes.

When compared to IPv4, a simpler IP address plan is possible,

because

there

is

less optimization required to expand the network, for

example

to avoid IP overlapping.

Migration to All-IPv6 networks

A network with all interfaces and layers using the same IP

version

is simpler to manage.

Fixed

and mobile networks and applications on the same IP version

simplify

network operation,

because

there

are

simpler routing

tables, simpler

network configuration and quicker troubleshooting

for IP

related

issues.

# 3 IPv6 Business Values

OPEX Reduction: Simplify

Operations

Simplification

saves time. The rollout of IPv6 addresses on

all

interfaces and application layers simplifies the IP address planning and network

configuration by using only one IP version. The use of the same IP version

throughout the network

also

simplifies

troubleshooting.

Revenue Growth: Enabler for

Functional

Growth

IPv6 is a

strategic

and long term

investment.

The investment and early deployment of IPv6 on the LTE

network

ensures

that the operator

is

prepared in advance for the rapid increase in network

nodes,

and supports

the

future technologies requiring the use of increased numbers of IP addresses.

This enables

the continued growth of the mobile broadband

business.

# 4 Included Functions

## 4.1 IPv6 Overview

This feature is a future-proof addressing system that offers 128-bit

addresses.

Summary

This feature provides the eNodeB with an address that does not have to be translated

to NAT. The new address space supports 2128 (about 3.4Ã—1038)

addresses.

The IPv6 feature enables the operator to deploy nodes in an IPv6 network, and to

directly communicate with external IPv6 networks without using additional address

translation or tunneling mechanisms.

This feature can be used for new IPv6 node deployment, as well as for upgrading nodes

that need to migrate from an IPv4 to an IPv6 RAN.

IPv6 addressing is supported for virtual (loopback) IP interfaces.

When using IPsec, IPv6 addressing is supported in both the inner and outer

networks.

This feature can be used to automatically assign default routes and the following

addresses:

- Dynamic IPv6
- DNS server
