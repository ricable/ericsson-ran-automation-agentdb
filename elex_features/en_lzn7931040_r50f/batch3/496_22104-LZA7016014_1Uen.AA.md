# 1 Minimum Interference Scheduling Overview

The feature allows the random selection of the starting position for uplink PRB

allocation in the band. This can reduce cell interference for uplink traffic at the edges of

the band.

Summary

It is possible to use the resource fair allocation strategy without many PRBs allocated to

uplink traffic. In such cases, high interference occurs between intra-frequency

cells on the band edges.

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature allows a more even distribution of uplink PRBs. It

uses a random starting point in the band for PRB allocation when uplink PRB use is

low. This can spread uplink interference evenly across the whole spectrum. As a

result, uplink performance can increase. The gain is dependent on the load and

traffic characteristics.

The feature also allows to configure two reserved regions next to PUCCH. These regions are

between each PUCCH and the band center. New transmissions try to avoid using these

PRBs to reduce uplink interference in these regions.

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature is supported for both in FDD and TDD cells.

Interoperability with Other Features in Special Cases

## 2.1 Interoperability with Other Features in Special Cases

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature has a more complex relationship with

certain features.

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature has different interoperability cases with the

PUCCH Overdimensioning feature and the NB-IoT Access feature.

PUCCH Overdimensioning

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature does not operate if the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature is activated with its

default configuration. In this case, outer unused resource blocks in the PUCCH

regions are used for PUSCH data.

Figure 1   Uplink Band Configuration with PUCCH Overdimensioning

If the ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation feature is active

and it blocks outer unused resource blocks in the PUCCH regions, the Minimum

Interference Scheduling feature can operate.

Figure 2   Uplink Band Configuration with PUCCH Overdimensioning and ICIC

NB-IoT Access

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature does not operate in the following

conditions:

- NB-IoT is active in the in-band deployment mode.
- The total number of available PUSCH PRBs between PUCCH regions and band edges is greater than one.

This can occur in specific configuration cases or if the in-band NB-IoT cell is

locked.

Figure 3   NB-IoT in the In-Band Deployment Mode and an Increased Number of PUSCH

PRBs

The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature is supported with NB-IoT in the following

deployment modes and configurations:

- Guard band deployment mode
- Standalone deployment mode
- In-band deployment mode with default configuration
- In-band deployment mode with a custom configuration, if there is a maximum of one PUSCH PRB between PUCCH regions and the band edges Figure 4 NB-IoT in In-Band Deployment Mode and a Supported Number of PUSCH PRBs
NB-IoT and MIS supported

![Image](../images/496_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AA/additional_3_CP.png)

If an uplink reserved region is configured, an in-band NB-IoT cell with a custom

configuration located in the reserved region can benefit from lower

interference.

# 3 Feature Operation of Minimum Interference Scheduling

The feature operates in each TTI in a new transmission phase. A random configurable

starting point is determined for uplink PRB allocation when the estimated PRB use in the

given TTI is low.

In a new transmission phase, the estimated PRB use in the current TTI can be low. In such

cases, a new uplink starting position is determined for resource fair resource

allocation transmissions. This process is affected by the Minimum Interference

Scheduling feature.

Operational Process

1. The EUtranCellFDD.minInterfUlRegionSize or the EUtranCellTDD.minInterfUlRegionSize attribute is examined to determine reserved uplink regions. If the attribute is set to zero, there are no reserved regions.
2. The available PUSCH is calculated within two PUCCH regions. This gives the number of the first available PRB from the low edge of the band and the high edge of the band. High priority transmissions are not considered here.
3. An estimate of the number of required PRBs for the new transmission is calculated. The estimate is calculated as a sum of PRBs required by all new transmissions in the current TTI.
4. The uplink start position is set in a certain distance from the PUCCH region if possible. The distance is determined by the required number of positions. The region set by the EUtranCellFDD.minInterfUlRegionSize or the EUtranCellTDD.minInterfUlRegionSize attribute is represented by k. This uplink reserved region exists if the attribute is greater than zero. The value represented by r is a random value. The r value is created if the estimated number of required PRBs is low enough. There are three possible modification possibilities for the start position. Figure 5 Starting Position Modified by k Figure 6 Starting Position Modified by k+r Regions in the two band edges are not used by new transmissions on the following conditions: The uplink region size is greater than zero. The estimated number of uplink PRBs is low. The r value is created and added to k to determine the starting position if the estimated PRB number is low enough. The starting position is determined at a distance of k or k+r positions from the PUCCH region. Figure 7 Starting Position Modified by r The r value is created and added to the starting position on the following conditions: The uplink region size is zero. The estimated PRB number is sufficiently low. The starting position is determined at a distance of r positions from the PUCCH region. Figure 8 Unmodified Starting Position If the estimated required uplink PRB number is too high, the starting position is not changed.

# 4 Network Impact of Minimum Interference Scheduling

The feature can have a positive impact on uplink interference. It can also improve

uplink performance when a low number of uplink PRBs is

used.

Capacity and Performance

The feature has no impact on capacity. Uplink performance is improved by evenly

spreading uplink interference across the spectrum.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Minimum Interference Scheduling

This feature introduces parameters to configure the uplink PRB region size between a

| Average UL MAC Cell Throughput  | UE cell throughput is expected to be lowered in some cases, as                                     the available spectrum becomes more fragmented when a new                                     starting position is selected for new transmissions. This can                                     happen in cases of high uplink PRB use and large-buffer UEs. The                                     magnitude of this impact depends on the exact load and type of                                     traffic in the cell. |

| Average UL PDCP UE Throughput   | Peak throughput achieved by a single UE can be lowered, as the                                     available spectrum becomes more fragmented and the largest                                     possible island allocation size is reduced.

following counters are used to observe this impact:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSinrPuschDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSinrPuschDistr

The EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrbX and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrbX PM counters

exist for each possible PRB, where X is the number of the PRB. For example, the

following PM counters are related to the first PRB of the band:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb1
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb1

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Minimum Interference Scheduling

The feature can be enabled, disabled, and the uplink reserved region size can be

controlled by MOM attributes. For the expected gain, the feature must be enabled in a group

of intra-frequency cells. In this case, the uplink interference can be spread across the

entire spectrum.

The feature is not controlled by a license, but it can be enabled and disabled by the

EUtranCellFDD.minInterfSchedEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.minInterfSchedEnabled attribute.

The EUtranCellFDD.minInterfUlRegionSize or the

EUtranCellTDD.minInterfUlRegionSize attribute can be set to

control the uplink region size between each PUCCH region and the band center. The

allowed maximum region size depends on the bandwidth. Two different use case settings

can be distinguished:

- The attribute value can be set to zero. New transmissions with the resource fair resource allocation strategy use the uplink spectrum more evenly between PUCCH regions.
- The attribute value can be set to a non-zero value. New transmissions with the resource fair resource allocation strategy use the uplink spectrum more evenly between PUCCH regions, except in reserved uplink regions.

While setting a value of zero is recommended, the best value depends on the

following network characteristics:

- The desired distribution of uplink interference.
- The amount of tolerable uplink spectrum fragmentation.

## 8.1 Enable Minimum Interference Scheduling

The feature is not controlled by a license, but it needs to be enabled through MO

attribute configuration.
