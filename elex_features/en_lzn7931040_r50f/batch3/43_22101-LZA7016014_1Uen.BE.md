| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                         |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

The feature allows for the controlling of the number of scheduling opportunities for

each bearer. This is controlled by configuring relative proportions for services

using a specific QCI. The feature provides the specified scheduling opportunity

ratio between two bearers created by two resource fair QCIs.

The ratio of the number of scheduling opportunities translates to similar throughput

ratio only in the following conditions:

- The full buffer traffic model is used.
- The measured UEs have similar radio conditions.

Example 1

If UE 1 has a relative priority of 2 and UE 2 has a relative priority of 3, the

following ratios apply:

- UE 1 gets two thirds times the number of scheduling opportunities of UE 2.
- UE 2 gets three halves times the number of scheduling opportunities of UE 1.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The ASGH-Based A/B Testing Framework feature provides an efficient way to test the

network performance of functions.

The possibility to distribute users randomly between subscriber groups enables the

testing of different parameterization simultaneously in the same node and cell.

This feature helps to evaluate a new functionality while running it simultaneously

with existing functionality in the same environment without a need for long weeks of

testing time.

A selection probability mechanism is also added to the UE selection procedure. A/B

testing is implemented with the use of a percentage-based selection probability

mechanism in the trigger-list-based UE selection procedure into advanced subscriber

groups. This mechanism defines a percentage-based probability which determines that

a user is included in a subscriber group if all given conditions are fulfilled. This

mechanism helps to implement A/B testing.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                 node. |

Summary

The Differentiated Admission Control feature provides higher accessibility for UEs

and E-RABs with high Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP). The feature also

enables optional SPID priority by prioritizing UEs and bearers over each other

during admission control. The following access-differentiation algorithms are

supported:

- Differentiated blocking
- Preemption

The two algorithms can be activated together to achieve higher differentiation

effect.

Through differentiated blocking, higher accessibility is achieved for UEs and E-RABs

with high ARP at the cost of lower accessibility for UEs and E-RABs with low ARP.

The same is also applied for UEs with high SPID priority, if the SPID-based

filtering is activated.

Through differentiation by preemption, higher retainability is achieved for UEs and

E-RABs with high ARP at the cost of lower retainability for UEs and E-RABs with low

ARP or, optionally, low SPID priority.

When both differentiation algorithms are activated together, the cost in lower

retainability might be traded for the cost in lower accessibility for UEs and E-RABs

with low ARP.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The process of delaying packets in a traffic stream to cause it to conform to a defined

traffic profile is called rate shaping. The End-User Bitrate Shaping feature introduces the

rate shaping algorithm in the eNodeB. The aim is to limit the bit rate in uplink. This

limitation does not apply in downlink.

The End-User Bitrate Shaping feature acts as a QoS enabler and allows for a tiered

subscription model. The End-User Bitrate Shaping feature also limits the throughput for

users exceeding the data volume limit in their subscription.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler feature allows the resource sharing of

the Baseband unit, the network, and the node between different radio bearers. This

feature provides a trade-off between user fairness and system performance. This

feature enables the network to benefit from times when the radio conditions are

different for different users.

The benefits depend on the algorithm. Compared to the Resource Fair Scheduling

algorithm, users with higher channel quality are prioritized. This enables higher

throughput and increased cell capacity.

Scheduling fairness is also provided. The average rate is considered during the

prioritization to avoid allocating few or no resources to users because of low

channel quality.

Flows with lower bit rates than the configured minimum bit rate are prioritized

before the flows that have bit rates above the configured minimum rate.

This minimum rate QoS configuration allows for consistent cell-edge throughput.

In addition, the throughput of UEs capable of carrier aggregation (CA) over UEs

without carrier aggregation can be adjusted if the CA-capable UEs have at least one

secondary cell activated for downlink data transmission.

## 3.11 NR UE Throughput Booster Overview

This feature introduces an ASGH group for NR UEs and subscriptions and improves the

throughput by prioritizing NR UEs.

| Feature Name           | NR UE Throughput Booster                                                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5242                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband                                            |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0409                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature enhances the performance of EN-DC by implementing new trigger conditions

for NR UEs and subscriptions based on the ASGH framework. Both static and dynamic

groupings are supported. Static grouping of NR UEs is based on UE capability and NR

restrictions, while dynamic grouping of NR UEs is based on the EN-DC-configured

state. When the SCG radio resources are set up, the UE is selected into the NR UE

group. When the secondary node is released, the UE is removed from the NR UE group.

The feature supports both EN-DC-capable UEs and NR standalone-capable UEs.

NR UEs can be prioritized by remapping from the predefined QCIs to the

operator-defined QCIs. ASGH-based features can be applied to the grouped NR UEs to

improve their performance.

This feature has the following benefits:

- When both LTE and NR UEs are present in the network, this feature enables NR UEs to compete for more resources.
- In an EN-DC deployment, the throughput of the MCG radio resources can be improved by prioritizing EN-DC-capable UEs.
- In an NR standalone deployment, after the NR standalone-capable UE switches from the gNodeB to the eNodeB, this feature can make its priority higher than the priority of LTE UEs. This leads to better performance in the eNodeB.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

## 3.12 Operator Defined QCI Overview

The Operator Defined QCI feature allows operator-defined QCI profiles to be assigned to

bearers or service flows.

| Feature Name           | Operator Defined QCI                                               |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

This feature enables the operator to define and configure new QCIs in addition to the

existing standardized QCIs (0-9). This allows a more flexible differentiation between

bearers or service flows from a QoS perspective. The operator can define additional QCI

profiles associated with QCI values in the 10-255 range.

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature allows the operator to control the bit rate

proportions. Services are assigned the proportions through a specific QCI parameter in

relation to other services using other QCIs.

The Relative Priority Scheduling feature provides the specified bit rate ratios when either

the radio conditions are ignored (equal rate), or when all UEs have similar radio

conditions. Otherwise, the difference in experienced radio conditions influences the

resulting bit rate proportions (proportional fair).

Example 2

If UE 1 has a relative priority of 2 and UE 2 has a relative priority of 3, the following

ratios apply:

- UE 1 gets two thirds times the throughput of UE 2.
- UE 2 gets three halves times the throughput of UE 1.

Additional Information

rate proportions caused by selected fairness, see Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler.

| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature enables the eNodeB to evaluate the continuous uplink traffic of UEs and

to flag UEs as uplink-heavy. If there are neighboring cells with higher uplink

capacity, the feature uses A5 measurements to find a cell that can better serve the

uplink throughput demand of the UEs. If a suitable cell is available, the eNodeB

triggers UE handover towards the cell.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved uplink throughput for uplink-heavy UEs
- Improved utilization of the uplink capacity of the network by moving uplink-heavy users to cells with higher uplink capacity

The main use case for the feature is a TDD-FDD mixed network because TDD cells have

typically lower uplink capacity than FDD cells. If the Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover

and the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility features are both enabled, the

uplink-heavy UEs are moved from the TDD cells to the FDD cells in mixed

networks.
