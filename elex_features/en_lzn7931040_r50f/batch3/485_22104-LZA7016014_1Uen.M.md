# 1 VoLTE Inactivity Timer Extension Overview

The feature introduces a configurable extension to the inactivity timer after the end

of a VoLTE call.

Summary

With the extended inactivity timer, UEs are kept in connected mode for a longer

period after a VoLTE call ends. In connected mode, there is no need for paging and

connection setup, so a call can be set up faster than in idle mode. This results in

decreased times for call setup in case of frequent VoLTE calls.

The inactivity timer extension can be configured separately for UEs that do not

belong to subscriber groups and UEs of each subscriber group using the ASGH

Framework feature. The function is also supported during S1 or X2 handover and RRC

re-establishment.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of VoLTE Inactivity Timer Extension

The feature adds an extension to the inactivity timer that determines how long a UE

is kept in connected mode after the end of a VoLTE call.

The inactivity timer extension can be set using the following attributes:

- Rcs.extendInactAfterVolteRel: this attribute sets the extension that applies to all connected UEs that do not belong to any subscriber groups.
- SubscriberGroupProfile.groupExtendInactAfterVolteRel: this attribute sets the extension that applies to UEs using the specific subscriber group profile. The extension must be set on the subscriber group that the UE is using after the VoLTE call release.

SubscriberGroupProfile.groupExtendInactAfterVolteRel overrides

Rcs.extendInactAfterVolteRel for all UEs that belong to any

subscriber group.

The extension is only applicable after a VoLTE call release. The total inactivity time

before the UE goes into idle mode is the sum of the value of the

Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute and the inactivity timer

extension.

If the Service Specific Inactivity Timer feature is active, the total inactivity time is

the sum of the following:

- The value of the Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute
- The inactivity timer extension
- The highest configured inactivityTimerOffset among active e-RABs.

If the UE performs an S1 or X2 handover or an RRC reestablishment procedure, the total

inactivity time is not affected. The time passed between the end of the last VoLTE call

and the handover is sent to the target eNodeB. It then calculates the time remaining

from the total inactivity time for the UE.

# 4 Network Impact of VoLTE Inactivity Timer Extension

When this feature is active, the total number of connected users is

increased.

Capacity and Performance

The total number of connected UEs is increased. In high traffic, this can lead to

reaching the allowed maximum number of connected users and triggering admission

control.

It is not recommended to keep this feature activated for long periods of time in

normal operation, due to the radio utilization impact of the increased number of

connected users.

Interfaces

- S1 and X2 Interface At S1 or X2 handover, the time passed between the end of the last VoLTE call and the handover is sent to the target eNodeB in an Ericsson Private IE introduced by the feature. This ensures that the total inactivity time for the UE is not affected by the handover.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for VoLTE Inactivity Timer Extension

The feature introduces parameters for setting the length of the inactivity timer

extension.

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate VoLTE Inactivity Timer Extension

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012453 MO instance.
