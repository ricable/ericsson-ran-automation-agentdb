# 1 Service Triggered Mobility Overview

The feature enables coverage-triggered mobility based on the QoS defined for the UE

bearers.

| Value Package Name:     | Service-Based Mobility                                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0433                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature applies dynamic levels of coverage thresholds based on the QCI profiles of the

bearers.

The feature allows the operator to set mobility thresholds for each QCI profile, with the

consequence that coverage-based mobility indirectly becomes service-based mobility.

Service quality is ensured by having the UE connected to the cell that has the best

coverage for the given UE services.

# 3 Feature Operation of Service Triggered Mobility

This feature itself has no flow, but it crosscuts the flows of other

features.

The feature ensures that a UE with certain bearer QCI constellation is connected to the

cell with the best coverage for the given UE services.

The threshold offset settings and the base threshold settings must be carefully

configured that the UE is ordered to look for better target cells when finding such

cells is possible.

Each QCI profile holds threshold offsets for the following:

- A1 measurement
- A2 measurement
- A5 measurement
- B2 measurement
- Offset adjustment for A3 measurement

The eNodeB reconfigures the threshold levels in the UE, based on the changing

bearer QCI profile constellation.

The QCI profile constellation of a bearer can change because of the following

processes:

- Bearer setup
- Release
- Bearer modification

Each threshold configured in a UE is based on the highest or the most prioritized offsets

found in the QCI profiles of all bearers. For example, a UE with bearers requiring high

signal quality reports poor coverage earlier than another UE with bearers not requiring

high signal quality.

In this context, it is important to respect the relation between threshold values.

If measurements are configured as described, for example in Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity, the Service

Triggered Mobility feature is used in the following cases:

- Before configuring the measurements to compute measurement thresholds according to the UE bearer QCI constellation. For each measurement type configured in the UE, the measurement thresholds sent to the UE are computed. It is calculated as the maximum or the most prioritized of all threshold values corresponding to the QCI profiles of the UE bearers. For example, the value of the A1 measurement RSRP threshold is obtained from the sum of the following: The ReportConfigA1Prim.a1ThresholdRsrpPrim base threshold The maximum or the most prioritized a1ThresholdRsrpPrimOffset value defined in QciProfilePredefined.measReportConfigParams or QciProfileOperatorDefined.measReportConfigParams Similar reasoning can be applied to all measurement thresholds.
- Whenever one or several bearers are set up, released, or modified for a certain UE for which measurements are already configured. The feature recomputes measurement thresholds because of the bearer QCI constellation change and reconfigures measurements in the UE if a measurement threshold value is changed. The UE measurements are reconfigured and the respective threshold is changed in the following situations: When one or several bearers are set up, if at least one setup bearer has a QCI profile where the threshold offset is larger or more prioritized than the current value of the corresponding threshold offset. When one or several bearers are released, if all released bearers have a QCI profile where some threshold offsets have the same value or are equally prioritized than the current relevant value of the corresponding threshold offsets. When one or several bearers are modified, if at least one of the modified bearers is allocated a QCI profile where some threshold offset is larger or more prioritized than the current relevant value of the corresponding threshold offset. In all three cases, if several measurements are affected by similar threshold changes, all new thresholds are sent to the UE in the same reconfiguration message. This reconfiguration message is the same as the one that is sent to inform the UE about the setup, released, or modified bearers.

The feature improves UE service quality.

Capacity and Performance

The feature affects the mobility patterns of the UE because of changes in the

settings of measurement thresholds through tuning of threshold offsets for each QCI.

The UE service quality is improved by ensuring that the UE is connected to the cell

with the best coverage for the given UE service.

# 6 Performance of Service Triggered Mobility

This feature has indirectly associated KPIs and counters.

KPIs

The Mobility Success Rate KPIs are indirectly affected by the feature.

Counters

The handover and the context release-related counters are indirectly affected by the

feature. This is because the UE can execute mobility actions, RwR or handover, more

frequently or more seldom than when offset values are not used for changing the

behavior of base threshold values.

For example, the following counters can be affected for handover:

- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAtt
- GeranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAtt
- UtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAtt
- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAtt
- GeranCellRelation.pmHoExeAtt
- UtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAtt
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAttLteInterF

For example, the following counters can be affected for RwR:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCEUtra
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCEUtra
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCCdma
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCCdma
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCWcdma

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Service Triggered Mobility

The operator must configure the offset attributes for each QCI in the MOM with

distinct values for the QCI for achieving the UE differentiation.

The recommended relations between thresholds must be considered when configuring the

threshold offsets.

The following parameters are configured:

- QciProfileOperatorDefined.measReportConfigParams
- QciProfilePredefined.measReportConfigParams

The structure contains offset attributes corresponding to all existing measurement

threshold parameters.

## 9.1 Absolute Offset or Threshold Calculation

The offsetPerQciPrio parameter, member of the

MeasReportConfigParams struct holds the QCI-dependent offset

priority.

The QCI-dependent offset priority is not configurable for each event.

Depending on the QCI-dependent offset priority, the following values can be configured:

- The priority is set to a value different from -1, so offset with maximum QCI-dependent priority corresponding to the QCI profiles of the UE bearers is taken into calculation for absolute offset or threshold.
- The priority is set to -1, so offset is excluded from the calculation. If all priorities are set to -1, offset value is 0, meaning "base" threshold or offset value is used as absolute offset or threshold sent to the UE.
- The priority is set to 0 for all QCI profiles or there are multiple offsets with maximum QCI-dependent priority. So, offset with the highest value corresponding to the QCI profiles of the UE bearers is selected for calculation for absolute offset or threshold.

## 9.2 Example for Offset or Priority Selection

In the following example, A5 measurements are started after the reception of an

A2 measurement report followed by two bearer setups, one bearer release, and one bearer QCI

modification procedure. In addition, the UE has two bearers set up at the time of

starting the A5 measurements.

The following process is executed:

1. When setting up the A5 measurement, the values of the a5Threshold1RsrpUE and a5Threshold2RsrpUE thresholds are computed based on the UE bearer QCI constellation. These values are sent to the UE in the configuration message. The two bearers of the UE have QCIs 2 and 5. The values of the base parameters are the following: The values of the offset parameters are the following: The values of the QCI-dependent offset priority are the following: Case A, when both priorities are 0: offsetPerQciPrioQCIQCI=2= 0 offsetPerQciPrioQCIQCI=5= 0 Case B, when the priority is configured: offsetPerQciPrioQCIQCI=2= 6 offsetPerQciPrioQCIQCI=5= 1 The values of the a5Threshold1RsrpUE and a5Threshold2RsrpUE thresholds to be sent to the UE are the following: Case A: a5Threshold1RsrpUE = -130 +max (3,6) = -130 + 6 = -124 a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -125 + max (1,4) = -125 + 4 = -121 Case B: a5Threshold1RsrpUE = -130 + maxOffsetPerQciPrio (3,6) = -130 + 3 = - 127 a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -125 + maxOffsetPerQciPrio (1,4) = -125 + 1 = - 124 Note: Maximum offset is selected for Case A, since QCI-dependent priority for all QCI profiles has default value, and offset with maximum QCI-dependent priority is selected for Case B.
    - a5Threshold1Rsrp= -130
    - a5Threshold2Rsrp= -125
    - a5Threshold1RsrpOffsetQCI=2= 3
    - a5Threshold2RsrpOffsetQCI=2= 1
    - a5Threshold1RsrpOffsetQCI=5= 6
    - a5Threshold2RsrpOffsetQCI=5= 4
2. When the first bearer setup occurs, the threshold offsets given by the QCI profiles of the new bearers are observed. In the example, the A5 measurement-related RSRP thresholds are observed, but all thresholds of all configured measurements are needed to be observed. In this bearer setup procedure, one bearer is set up and this bearer has a QCI profile with QCI value 7. The values of the offset thresholds and the QCI depended priority of the offset for the A5 RSRP measurements for QCI=7 are the following: Case A: offsetPerQciPrioQCI=7= 0 Case B: offsetPerQciPrioQCI=7= 7 Case A: Currently selected a5Threshold1RsrpOffset is the one configured for QCI=5, which has offset value 6. Since QCI=7 has offset value 8, which is larger than 6, new value a5Threshold1RsrpUE is calculated as follows: a5Threshold1RsrpUE = -130 + 8 = -122 Similarly, the new value of a5Threshold2RsrpUE is calculated as follows: a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -125 + 6 = -119 Case B: Currently selected a5Threshold1RsrpOffset is the one configured for QCI=2, which has priority 6. Since QCI=7 has priority 7, which is higher than 6, the new value of a5Threshold1RsrpUE is calculated as follows: a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -130 + 8 = -122 Similarly, the new value of a5Threshold2RsrpUE is calculated as follows: a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -125 + 6 = -119 Therefore, the UE must be reconfigured with new threshold values.
    - a5Threshold1RsrpOffsetQCI=7= 8
    - a5Threshold2RsrpOffsetQCI=7= 6
3. The next bearer setup is again with a bearer that has QCI=7. In this case, no UE measurement reconfiguration is required, as no threshold values are changed.
4. The bearer release involved the two bearers with QCI=7. This means that the UE has the two bearers with QCIs 2 and 5 respectively. Therefore, the UE must be reconfigured with new A5 measurement thresholds, and these have the following values, computed at process step 1: Case A: Case B:
    - a5Threshold1RsrpUE = -124
    - a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -121
    - a5Threshold1RsrpUE = -127
    - a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -124
5. The QCI modification involves a modification of the bearer with QCI=2; the QCI value is changed from 2 to 7. The UE must be reconfigured with new A5 measurement thresholds with values, computed at process step 2, as follows: For both Case A and Case B:
    - a5Threshold1RsrpUE = -122
    - a5Threshold2RsrpUE = -119

## 9.3 Time-to-Trigger Value for A3 Measurement Calculation

A3 measurement supports QCI-dependent time-to-trigger.

When relevant QCI-dependent offset is selected, corresponding time-to-trigger value is

selected from relevant QCI.
