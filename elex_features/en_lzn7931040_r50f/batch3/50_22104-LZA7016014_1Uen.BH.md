# 1 PCI Conflict Reporting Overview

The PCI Conflict Reporting feature detects PCI conflicts and reports them to the

ENM.

Summary

This feature improves handover and UE drop statistics through the reporting of PCI conflicts

to the ENM. This allows for the fast resolution of PCI conflicts.

UEs cannot distinguish between two cells if the cells have the same PCI and the same

frequency. It is possible that a handover fails if the PCI that is included in the

measurement report does not uniquely identify the cell. The PCI Conflict Reporting

feature detects PCI confusion, which happens when PCIs do not uniquely identify the

neighbor cells. As a result, a faulty configuration can be detected

automatically.

PCI confusion might occur even when no configured relations exist.

PCI collision is when a UE is in one cell and can detect another cell with the same PCI and

frequency. If the UE needs to perform a handover to a cell with the same PCI as the

source cell, the UE moves towards the cell with the same PCI and frequency. In most

of these cases, the UE drops, because it cannot distinguish the target cell from the

source cell. PCI collision can be detected by the PCI Conflict Reporting feature

only if relations are manually configured. However, it is possible that a PCI

collision also results in a PCI confusion for another cell. PCI collisions are

detected indirectly by this feature. This improves statistics regarding UE drops

caused by PCI collisions.

# 3 Feature Operation of PCI Conflict Reporting

The PCI Conflict Reporting feature detects if PCIs do not uniquely identify the

neighbor cells.

PCI confusion occurs because a UE cannot distinguish between two cells if they have the

same PCI and the same

frequency. In

addition to detecting and reporting LTE PCI conflict, it is possible to automatically

detect and report PCI conflicts for NR neighbor cells in LTE if the

ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute is set to

NR or BOTH.

## 3.1 Operational Process for LTE PCI Conflict

The prerequisites for PCI conflict reporting are the following:

1. PCI=1 cells are on the same frequency.
2. Neighbor cell relations from the PCI=10 cell to the PCI=1 cell of RBS C exist.
3. The ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute is set to LTE or BOTH.

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram of PCI Conflict Reporting

1. A first neighbor cell relation from the PCI=1 cell of RBS A to the PCI=10 cell of RBS B is created in RBS A by ANR or manually.
2. One of the following occurs:
    1. RBS B receives X2 setup request, X2 setup response, or eNodeB configuration update from RBS A with information about the new neighbor cell relation.
    2. S1 incoming handover is attempted from RBS A to RBS B with information about the new neighbor cell relation.
3. The external cell list in RBS B contains two PCI=1 cells. Depending on acting functionality, the following cases are possible: If ENodeBFunction.x2SetupTwoWayRelations is true, RBS B creates mutual relation from the PCI=10 cell to the PCI=1 cell of RBS A. If ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary39 is set to 1 or the default value, a relation from the PCI=10 cell of RBS B to the PCI=1 cell of RBS A is created.
4. When the relation is created, PCI confusion (PCI=1) is detected in the cell in RBS B and reported to OSS.

### 3.1.1 Process Steps

PCI confusion and conflict detection is based on one of the following:

- Configured relation
- X2 Functionality
- S1 incoming handover

To activate the detection and reporting of a PCI conflict between LTE neighbor cells, the

ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute must be set to

BOTH or LTE.

#### 3.1.1.1 PCI Conflict Detected Based on Configured Relation

PCI confusion and collision are detected based on configured relation.

PCI confusion is reported to the OSS if the following is true:

- An LTE cell has neighbor cell relationship for mobility to two LTE cells where both cells have the same PCI and frequency.

PCI collision is reported to the OSS if the following is true:

- An LTE cell has neighbor cell relationship to an LTE cell with the same PCI and frequency.Note: This can only occur when a neighbor cell relation is created manually.

The following triggers the execution of PCI conflict check:

- One new relation is added.
- ExternalENodeBFunction.ExternalEUtranCellFDD or ExternalENodeBFunction.ExternalEUtranCellTDD gets a new PCI.
- The ENodeBFunction.EUtranCellFDD or the ENodeBFunction.EUtranCellTDD internal cell gets a new PCI.

If a PCI conflict is detected, the pciConflict attribute is set to

YES or YES\_CONFLICTING\_CELL. This results in the

PCI CONFLICT DETECTED CM event.

#### 3.1.1.2 Reporting PCI Conflict Detected Based on X2 Functionality

PCI confusion detection is based on sending neighbor information in X2 setup request,

X2 setup response, and eNodeB configuration update.

Neighbor information is information about the configured relations for each served cell. When

the relation is added or deleted, the neighbor information is sent to the neighbor RBSs over

X2.

Neighbor information for an LTE cell relation contains the following information:

- LTE Cell Global Identifier of the neighbor cell
- PCI of the neighbor cell
- Downlink EARFCN for FDD and EARFCN for TDD

Neighbor information is used to create two-way relations, that is, the RBS creates a two-way

relation for each entry in the received neighbor information that contains a relation to a

source cell.

The sending of neighbor information over X2 and the setup of two-way relations result in

configured relations. This makes the detection of PCI confusions possible.

If two neighbor CBRS cells belong to different operators and there is no X2 connection

between the cells, the CBRS Alliance is responsible for the CBRS coexistence. In this case,

PCI conflicts are not resolved, because the Coexistence Manager within the CBRS Alliance does

not support PCI conflict resolution. For more information, refer to CBRS Alliance

specifications.

#### 3.1.1.3 Reporting PCI Conflict Detected Based on S1 Incoming Handover

PCI conflict detection is based on neighbor cell CGI, PCI, and EARFCN received along

with S1 Incoming Handover attempt.

When PCI conflict is identified, a new relation is created, and the RBS can report this

to the operator.

#### 3.1.1.4 Reporting PCI Conflict Resolved to the OSS

The RBS checks if a PCI conflict is resolved if one of the following

is true:

- One relation is deleted.
- ExternalENodeBFunction.ExternalEUtranCellFDD or ExternalENodeBFunction.ExternalEUtranCellTDD is assigned a new PCI.
- ENodeBFunction.EUtranCellFdd (internal cell) is assigned a new PCI.

If a PCI conflict is resolved, the pciConflict attribute is set to

NO. This results in the PCI CONFLICT RESOLVED CM

event.

## 3.2 Operational Process for NR PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting

It is possible to automatically detect and report PCI conflicts for NR neighbor cells

in LTE.

NR PCI conflicts can be detected if the following conditions apply:

- The ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute is set to BOTH or NR.
- NR cells are configured with the same PCI and frequency.
- One NR neighbor cell relation exists in the LTE anchor cell toward an NR neighbor cell.
- ANR is activated with the following settings to find another NR neighbor cell with PCI conflict: The AnrFunctionNR.pciConflictDetectionType attribute is set to FR1, FR2, or BOTH for the corresponding NR frequency range. The AnrFunctionNR.endcRachFailThrPerUe attribute is set to a value higher than 0.

Figure 3   NR PCI Conflict Detection

1. An NR neighbor cell relation from the LTE anchor cell to NR Cell 1 with PCI=1 is created by ANR or by the operator.
2. NR random access failure at EN-DC setup with NR Cell 1 is monitored to check if another NR neighbor cell exists with the same PCI, creating a PCI conflict.
    1. If the number of NR random access failures in the RRC SCGFailureInformationNR message reaches the configured level for the cell relation to NR Cell 1 with PCI=1, it is suspected that there is another NR cell with the same PCI.
    2. ANR is triggered to find another NR cell with the same PCI if NR PCI conflict is suspected.
3. ANR creates a cell relation for NR Cell 2 with the same PCI.
4. NR PCI conflict is detected, and it is reported through the generated INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_DETECTED PM event. The ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict attribute for the original cell relation toward NR Cell 1 is automatically set to YES, and the ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict attribute for the newly created cell relation toward NR Cell 2 is automatically set to YES\_CONFLICTING\_CELL. Note: If the cell relation toward NR Cell 2 is created manually by the operator, PCI conflict is reported the same way.

### 3.2.1 NR PCI Conflict Detection

NR PCI conflict detection is based on the following information:

- Cell relations that are configured by ANR or by the operator
- EN-DC X2 messages

#### 3.2.1.1 NR PCI Conflict Detection Based on Configured Cell Relation

NR PCI conflicts can be detected based on the cell relation that is configured by ANR

or by the operator.

If an LTE cell has neighbor cell relations to multiple NR cells, and two or more NR cells

have the same PCI and frequency, NR PCI conflicts are detected and reported to the

ENM.

The following procedures trigger the execution of a PCI conflict check:

- A new cell relation is added by ANR or by the operator.
- The ExternalGUtranCell.nRPCI attribute is automatically updated with a new NR PCI.

If an NR PCI conflict is detected, it is reported through the generated

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_DETECTED PM event. The

ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict attribute for the original cell

relation is automatically set to YES, and the

ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict attribute for the newly created

cell relation is automatically set to YES\_CONFLICTING\_CELL.

If the change triggering NR PCI conflict evaluation happens in the n48 band, the

evaluation guard timer is extended to 10 seconds and started. This is to prevent

temporary reports of NR PCI conflict while the automatic NR neighbor configuration

update triggered by the frequency change in the n48 band is ongoing. For more

information on the automatic update of NR frequency relations, see Automated Neighbor Relations

#### 3.2.1.2 NR PCI Conflict Detection Based on EN-DC X2 Connection

NR PCI conflicts can be detected based on information in X2 messages.

NR PCI conflicts can be detected based on the Served NR Cell Information

IE, which is included in the X2AP EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE or the

X2AP EN-DC CONFIGURATION UPDATE message received over the EN-DC X2

connection.

If the PCI in the Served NR Cell Information IE is changed and the

ExternalGUtranCell MO already exists with the referred cell

relation for the served NR cell, it triggers the execution of a PCI conflict check.

If an NR PCI conflict is detected, it is reported through the generated

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_DETECTED PM event. The

ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict attribute is automatically set to

YES or YES\_CONFLICTING\_CELL.

### 3.2.2 Reporting NR PCI Conflict Resolved to the ENM

If an NR PCI conflict is resolved, it is reported through a PM event.

During the following procedures, the LTE cell checks if NR PCI conflicts are resolved:

- An LTE-to-NR cell relation is deleted during ANR removal, during NR frequency change, or by the operator.
- The ExternalGUtranCell.nRPCI attribute is automatically updated with a new NR PCI value.

If NR PCI conflicts are resolved, the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_RESOLVED PM event is generated.

The ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict attribute is automatically set to

NO from YES, and to

NO\_CONFLICTING\_CELL from YES\_CONFLICTING\_CELL.

# 4 Network Impact of PCI Conflict Reporting

The PCI Conflict Reporting feature makes the fast resolving of faulty configurations

possible.

Capacity and Performance

PCI conflicts can result in failed handover. The PCI Conflict Reporting feature can

detect PCI conflicts automatically. This way, a faulty configuration can be detected

and it is possible to resolve the PCI conflict fast.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of PCI Conflict Reporting

The feature can be parameterized by setting temporary, X2-related, and PCI

conflict-related attributes.

# 7 Activate PCI Conflict Reporting

To use the feature, it must be activated following the

usual feature activation procedure.

If the feature is planned to be activated on a large number of nodes in one ENM

deployment, it is recommended to only activate it on a few hundred nodes every few

hours. Otherwise, too many CM notifications might be generated for the newly

detected cells with PCI conflict at feature activation, which can increase ENM

load.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011183 MO instance.
2. Set the ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute to a value that corresponds to the RAN type for which PCI conflict detection is necessary.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate PCI Conflict Reporting

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be

deactivated following the usual feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated

before the activation of any conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011183 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 9.1 23.Q3: Enhanced NR PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting in LTE

The feature enhancement supports the reporting of PCI conflict detection for NR

neighbor cells in LTE.

| Feature Name           | PCI Conflict Reporting   |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 1898             |
| Value Package Name     | Self-Organizing Networks |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0435             |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node      |
| Access Type            | LTE                      |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                 |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, it is possible to automatically detect and report a

PCI conflict or the resolution of a PCI conflict for NR neighbor cells in LTE.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- With this enhancement, the operator can quickly detect and resolve PCI conflicts.
- The information supplied by the feature enhancement can be used for PCI planning in customer networks to avoid PCI conflict on NR cells.
- The NR PCI conflict reporting function is applicable for ANR-created and manually created neighbor configurations.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The ENodeBFunction.pciConflictReportType attribute is introduced

to enable the feature enhancement for LTE, for NR, or for both.

The following attributes are introduced to provide information about NR PCI conflict

and conflict resolving:

- ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflict
- ExternalGUtranCell.pciConflictCell
- ExternalGUtranCell.pciDetectingCell

The following PM events are introduced to provide information about NR PCI conflict

and conflict resolving:

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_DETECTED
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_RESOLVED

If the feature is planned to be activated on a large number of nodes in one ENM

deployment, it is recommended to only activate a few hundred nodes every few hours.

Otherwise, too many CM notifications might be generated for the newly detected PCI

conflict cells at feature activation, which increases ENM load.

The feature enhancement allows up to two NR PCI conflict cells to be reported even in

cases when more than two cells exist with PCI conflict.

ANR can only configure EN-DC-capable NR cells as an NR neighbor cell with PCI

conflict in LTE.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

PCI Conflict Reporting

## 9.2 24.Q2.0: NR PCI Conflict Detection Enhancement

The PCI conflict reporting timer is updated to prevent temporary PCI conflict reports

during automatic NR neighbor configuration updates triggered by a frequency change in the

n48 band.

| Feature Name           | PCI Conflict Reporting   |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 1898             |
| Value Package Name     | Self-Organizing Networks |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0435             |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node      |
| Access Type            | LTE                      |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                |

Summary and Benefits

During an automatic NR neighbor configuration update triggered by a frequency change

in the n48 band, the eNodeB moves cell relation MOs to a new frequency, creating

temporary NR PCI conflicts. This feature enhancement enables the eNodeB to check if

the change triggering PCI conflict checking is from a cell in the n48 band, and adds

extra time to the timer to avoid such PCI conflicts. This results in more useful

reports and easier conflict detection.

Capacity and Performance

The following PM events can trigger less frequently, because temporary conflicts are

not reported:

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_DETECTED
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_PCI\_CONFLICT\_RESOLVED

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
