# 1 Introduction

KPIs are used for RAN to measure the quality and system performance observed and

perceived by subscribers.

Monitoring the performance of a RAN through KPIs enables the following activities:

- Supervising and optimizing radio network performance to provide better quality or better use of available resources.
- Detecting performance issues in the network to preserve service quality.
- Providing radio network planners with detailed information for dimensioning, optimizing, and configuring the network.
- Troubleshooting on cell clusters of interest.

Performance Management (PM) counters collect performance statistics from measurements

on live traffic in the radio network. These measurements do not interfere with user

connection and transmission handling. The nodes can sometimes delay data collection and

postpone the measurement period due to increased resource use. In this case, the results

of the KPI calculations can be observed as a minor peak in the overall performance

statistics.

## 1.1 End-User Performance in LTE

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in LTE networks measure both end-user performance and

network performance in the RAN. The performance of end-user applications is measured

over a broader area than the RAN. As illustrated on , it covers the entire packet

delivery chain.

## 1.2 Observability in Ericsson LTE

Observability covers all functions in LTE RAN that supervise the performance and

characteristics of the network. This can be done on various levels with different target

groups and requirements. Figure 2 illustrates a

model for observability in LTE RAN.

| Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | The KPI represents the end-user perception of a network on a                                     macro level. Operators use KPI statistics to compare networks                                     against each other, and to detect problems and errors. KPIs are                                     calculated from PM counters. The reliability, granularity, and                                     accuracy of the data are critical, and the data is collected                                     continuously.  The KPIs in this document are classified as Recommended and                                     Others.   The metrics identified as recommended are most important to                                     monitor network performance. Metrics classified as others                                     supplement the recommended ones. |
| Performance Indicator (PI)      | The PI represents system level information that explains the KPI                                     results. Many PIs can be based on PM counters, for example, PM                                     counters for Root Cause Analysis. PIs can also be in the form of                                     metrics that show specific parts of the system can perform. PIs                                     usually have an impact on KPIs. PIs can be collected on                                     demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| RI                              | The RI represents system level information that explains the                                     system capacity and resource use. The RI data can be used for                                     planning and dimensioning. RI data, mostly from PM counters, can                                     be collected continuously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Procedure                       | The Procedure level represents in-depth troubleshooting, and the                                     measurements of system characteristics. Signalling, procedure,                                     and function levels are included in the measurements. The                                     purpose of the measurements is to investigate problems detected                                     at higher levels.  The measurements are generally user-initiated for a specific                                     purpose or for a specific area. The scope of the measurements                                     are limited with the specified aspects. The source for the data                                     is mostly the UE trace and the cell trace recording                                     functions.                             |

## 1.3 LTE RAN Performance Observability Model

The LTE RAN Performance Observability model used by Ericsson combines the general,

International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications (ITU-T) QoS categories with

mobility, availability and utilization.

In LTE, all sessions are Packet Switched (PS). The LTE network supports multiple

simultaneous services per user. ITU-T definitions are used as guidelines for performance

measurement.

KPIs are developed for observing the network performance impact on the end user, and for

observing the performance of the network itself. Each KPI is defined for observing

end-user impact or system performance.

## 1.4 Aggregation of KPIs

The PM counters can be aggregated in the following ways:

- Over a group of cells
- Over a cluster of cells
- Over one RBS
- Over multiple RBSs
- Over a complete geographic area
- Over time periods (hour, days, week)

Aggregation needs to be considered for maximum calculations in case of some PIs,

where the maximum value means the average of maximum or the maximum of average. A

distribution function can be created as an alternative for the set of max values, so

that the range of values can be preserved and highlighted. In some cases, the

data-capture tool and also the user data can provide some further aggregation.

Many KPIs are basically a ratio of two quantities (for example, between success and

failure, or between volume and time). Based on the two quantities, two basic aggregation

methodologies are available that can produce different results. The operator needs to

consider exactly what is calculated, and also know the advantage and disadvantage of the

calculated quantities.

The PM counters can be aggregated over time (for example, hour, day or week) for a

specific cell to get a cell-specific, time aggregated PI. The cell PI can be aggregated

over cell clusters to get an average over an area. Use both equations for the

aggregation.

Example of Aggregation

1. Aggregate the individual PM counter values across the time and geographic area using the equation.
2. Perform the PI equation.

In certain situations, an operator needs to replace the individual

pmXyz PM counter in each equation to get a metric over a

larger area and longer time, or for both.

1. Calculate the PI equation for the specific metric at the lower time and geographic resolution with the formula.
2. Aggregate across the longer time and larger geographic area using the equation.

Result of Aggregation

- Use of aggregated pmXyz can mask individual cells or times when there are not usual results in a specific time or location. This can result in an overall average.
- Use of PI(Cell&amp;ROP) can highlight the impact of individual metrics as each PI is equally weighted. This results in equal amount of weight for cells with minimal traffic and with large traffic. The final result can be biased.
- In cases where the denominator pmRst(Cell&amp;ROP) is a fixed number in the samples (for example, 900 seconds in a ROP), then both methods produce the same result.
- In case of throughput metrics, SUM(all\_Volume) / SUM(all\_Time), can introduce significant bias. For example, if a few UEs require a long delivery time because of poor RF. This can hide the benefits of features such as Carrier Aggregation and Frequency Selective Scheduling that attempt to maximize individual UE throughput.
- Aggregation of quantities based on time (for example, pmUeThpTimeDl and pmDrbThpTimeDlQci time counters, or uplink and downlink throughput metrics) need special consideration as aggregation when metric occurs simultaneously on same entity. Results can differ significantly from aggregation when there is no simultaneity. In reality, there is often a mixture of simultaneous and sequential actions which are challenging to interpret. Simultaneity can impact the definition of some PM counters. The pmPdcpVolDlDrbLastTti and SUM(pmPdcpVolDlLastTtiQci) PM Counters can be different depending on the simultaneity (at TTI level) of the individual QCI bursts.
- Same aggregation methodology needs to be used comparing results to avoid any differences triggered by the aggregation.
- SUM function needs to be avoided, if the aggregated quantities are depending on each other. For example, the volume and time metrics related to lastTt.
- The type of aggregation can be decided based on the date capture tool or the context and purpose of use.

Aggregation is indicated in the formulas when in use.

## 1.5 Service Separation of Observability in LTE RAN

In an LTE system, the service is not directly known to the RAN. If a service is mapped

towards a specific Quality of Service Class Indicator (QCI) or Allocation Retention

Priority (ARP), then it is possible to determine the observability of the service.

| Web sessions   |    | If seven is defined as QCI for Web sessions, downlink Throughput for Web                             sessions can be determined using the DL Throughput per QCI                             formula.     |
|----------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| VoIP           |    | If one is defined as QCI for VoIP, Retainability for VoIP can be                             determined using the E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost per                                 QCI formula. |

For the uplink, the scheduler grants resources based on Logical Channel Groups (LCG)

instead of QCI. Some uplink measurement per LCG is preferable than per QCI. For more

information about LCG and QCI, see Quality of Service (DU node) or

Manage Quality of Service (Baseband node).

## 1.6 Detailed Separation of Observability in LTE RAN with Flexible Counters

When new UE categories are introduced with different characteristics, for example Cat-M1

UE devices, KPIs can show higher or lower values. The solution can be using the Flexible

Counters feature or using PM counters that are related to the specific

characteristics.

The Flexible Counters feature can be used for the following purposes:

- Replacing the existing PM counters with the use of flexible counters and filters to the related PM counters. For example, if two PLMNs are used and the result for throughput is needed separately. The flexible counters filtered on the two PLMNs replace the legacy PM counters in the corresponding KPI.
- Compensating KPIs with subtracting legacy PM counters of a KPI formula and replacing it with flexible counters filtered on a specific characteristic. For example, Cat-M1 UE part is subtracting from the throughput KPI. The maximum throughput for Cat-M1 UE devices is lower than the average, which results in overall lower average for UE throughput. This can be compensated by using flexible counters filtered on the Cat-M1 UE category.

Each KPI formula that can be used with flexible counters are indicated with an

example.

For list of filters supported by flexible counters, see Flexible Counters.

## 2.4 Mobility

### 2.4.1 Cell Handover Execution Success Rate

This KPI measures system performance.

The Handover Execution Success rate includes both mobility-triggered handovers and handovers that are not triggered with mobility (for example for load balancing). The KPI covers only the move from the source cell to the target cell, as given in the following equation. PM counters in this KPI are on one of the following MO levels and must be aggregated over the various cell pairings for each type of handover. - EUtranCellRelation - UtranCellRelation - GeranCellRelation - GutranCellRelation - Cdma2001xRttCellRelation

Rarely used cell relations are not populated within EUtranCellRelation MO if the AnrFunction.nrHONeededToAddCellRelation attribute is larger than 0. Those new relations do not appear in the preceding Handover Execution equation until the handover attempt usage exceeds the new value of the attribute. A set of PM counters based on EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD is cell-based. These new PM counters are pegged whether the CellRelation has been created or not. If AnrFunction.nrHONeededToAddCellRelation is 0, then the PM counters and the cell-aggregated (CellRelation) counters are equivalent. These PM counters permit the following Cell Handover Execution KPI metric.

From the pmUeThp2DlDistr PM counter, a mean UE PDCP throughput (on a per-session basis) can be calculated.

The value for MeanBinValue[i] = 0.5 x ( Bin\_Upperbound[i] + Bin\_LowerBound[i] ). Since the last bin has no static Bin\_Upperbound[i] defined, a default of 1500000 is recommended for that (and is default used by reports in OSS, where this default can be adjusted if desired). This value is generally different from the legacy equation in Average DL PDCP UE Throughput as in this case each session has an equal weight in the averaging. Both are correct, but from different viewpoints.

PM counters in this KPI are on the MO EUtranCellRelation or UtranCellRelation or GeranCellRelation or GutranCellRelation or Cdma2001xRttCellRelation level and must be aggregated over the various cell pairings for each type of handover.

### 3.4.5 Cell Handover Success Rate

This KPI measures system performance.

The Handover Success rate includes both mobility-triggered handovers and handovers that are not triggered with mobility (for example for load balancing). The KPI covers both preparation of target cell resources and move from the source cell to the target cell, as given in the following equation. PM counters in this KPI are on the MO EUtranCellRelation or UtranCellRelation or GeranCellRelation or GutranCellRelation or Cdma2001xRttCellRelation level and must be aggregated over the various cell pairings for each type of handover.

Rarely used cell relations are not populated within MO EUtranCellRelation if attribute AnrFunction.nrHONeededToAddCellRelation &gt; 0. Those new relations do not appear in the preceding mobility equation until the handover attempt usage exceeds the new attribute value. PM counters based on EUtranCellFDD/EUtranCellTDD are cell-based. These new PM counters are pegged whether the CellRelation has been created or not. If AnrFunction.nrHONeededToAddCellRelation = 0, then the new PM counters and the cell-aggregated (CellRelation) counters are equivalent. These PM counters permit the Cell Handover KPI metric.
