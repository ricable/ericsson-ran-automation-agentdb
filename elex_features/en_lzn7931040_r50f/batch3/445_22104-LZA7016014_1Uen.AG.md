Network Impact of 256-QAM Uplink

# 3 Feature Operation of 256-QAM Uplink

The feature enables higher-order modulation handling including physical layer processing

and link adaptation.

Operational Process

Figure 1   256-QAM Uplink Feature Operation

1. The UE sends the UECapabilityInformation message with the ul-256QAM-r14 or the ul-256QAM-perCC-InfoListr14 IE to the eNodeB.
2. The eNodeB responds with the enable256QAM-r14 IE in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
3. The UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to the eNodeB.

# 4 Network Impact of 256-QAM Uplink

The feature increases uplink throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases uplink throughput by up to 40% and uplink average cell

throughput. It also increases spectral efficiency in uplink.

Increasing the value of the EUtranCellFDD.puschPwrOffset256qam or

the EUtranCellTDD.puschPwrOffset256qam attribute can improve

performance for 256-QAM capable UEs. However, this can increase interference level

in the network.

Interfaces

The feature supports the following elements:

- The ul-256QAM-r14 field in the UECapabilityInformation message
- The ul-256QAM-perCC-InfoListr14 field in the UECapabilityInformation message
- The PUSCH-ConfigDedicated-v1430 field in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message
- The PUSCH-ConfigDedicatedSCell-v1430 in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q1: TDD Support for 256-QAM Uplink

The

feature enhancement introduces support for TDD for the 256-QAM Uplink feature.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Benefits

The feature enhancement adds support for TDD for the 256-QAM Uplink feature.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement supports the following parameters for TDD:

- EUtranCellTDD.puschPwrOffset256qam
- EUtranCellTDD.ul256qamEnabled

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement is not supported on TDD AAS radios.

Other Network Elements

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q3: 256-QAM Uplink Support in SCell

The feature enhancement enables 256-QAM uplink modulation mode on PCell and SCell

with the Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature.

| Feature Name:           | 256-QAM Uplink      |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5031        |
| Value Package Name:     | Spectral Efficiency |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1015        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Benefits

In excellent radio conditions and low network load, uplink peak throughput can be

increased by 40% in UEs configured with 2CC.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases uplink peak throughput if the Uplink Carrier

Aggregation feature is used. Because of power constraints, throughput over PCell can

be limited to maximize combined carrier aggregation use and throughput.

It reduces RRC signaling during handover for UEs using 256-QAM in uplink.

Operation

The feature enhancement updates the pmUeCategoryDlUlCombDistr PM

counter and introduces the following flexible counters:

- pmFlexMacHarqUlDtx256qam
- pmFlexMacHarqUlFail256qam

- Increases cell throughput in uplink
- Increases UE throughput for uplink 256-QAM-capable UEs in good radio condition

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement increases uplink cell throughput, and uplink UE throughput

for

uplink

256-QAM-capable UEs in good radio condition.

If the EUtranCellTDD.puschPwrOffset256qam attribute is set to a

non-default value, the following interference increases might cause loss of

traffic:

- Towards UEs without uplink 256-QAM capability within the same MU group
- Towards UEs in adjacent cells

Operation

This feature enhancement requires the

EUtranCellTDD.ul256qamEnabled attribute to be set to

true.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement supports all TDD AAS radios.

Other Network Elements

UEs

must support 3GPP release 14 or later, and UE category 16 or later for 256-QAM

modulation.
