Summary

The feature provides detection, location, and reduction of inter-eNodeB duct interference.

These interfering eNodeBs normally are not within radio contact, but come into

contact due to specific atmospheric propagation conditions.

The feature detects atmospheric duct interference triggered by the character of the background

noise. If a cell detects the characteristic sequence during information

transmission, it triggers the cell to fall back to the use of SSP 5 or downlink

muting in carrier aggregation.

# 3 Feature Operation of Atmospheric Duct Interference Reduction

The feature mitigates the interference by configuring a longer guard period between

downlink and uplink.

## 3.1 Atmospheric Duct and Characteristics

In LTE TDD network, if atmospheric duct exists, the downlink signal of the cell traffic

is ducted to follow the earth curve, traveling further with less attenuation, as shown

in Figure 1. This causes interference in the

uplink traffic of other cells with the same frequency if the guard period is not enough

to cover the distance between the eNodeBs, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 1   Atmospheric Duct Interference

Figure 2   The Characteristics of Atmospheric Duct Interference

## 3.2 Slope Detection

When atmospheric duct appears, the interference from the downlink traffic of the remote

cell impacts the uplink traffic of the local cell.

With this feature, the local cells can detect the duct interference, as shown in Figure 3.

When the detected background noise is larger than the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntBgNoiseThr and the time domain slope is

detected, the slope detection status is updated in the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntSlopeDetectionStatus. Also the slope

detection result is recorded in the

INTERNAL\_PER\_CELL\_DUCT\_INTERFERENCE\_REPORT event.

Figure 3   Slope Detection

## 3.3 Duct Interference Location

If the EUtranCellTDD.ductIntOpMode is configured to

LOCATION, besides slope detection then characteristic sequence

transmission and detection is executed, as shown Figure 4.

Characteristic Sequence Transmission

In case a local cell finds that there might duct interference exist by slope

detection, or detects characteristic sequences from remote cells, it starts to send

characteristic information to other cells.

The characteristic information can be generated from eNodeBs according to the setting

of the ENodeBFunction.ductIntCharInfoScheme attribute. It is

encoded into the index of predefined characteristic sequences, together with the GPS

air time for transmission of the sequences.

It is also allowed to configure the characteristic information manually with the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCharInfoValue attribute instead of using

the ECGI, to provide more flexibility when generating characteristic sequences. The

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCharInfoValue attribute is used to

generate characteristic sequences on cell level. The

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCharInfoValue attribute must not be set

to -1 when the

ENodeBFunction.ductIntCharInfoScheme attribute is set to

CELL\_SPECIFIC.

For any local cell, the sequences are sent periodically, always at the last two OFDM

symbols of DwPTS in TDD special subframe.

Figure 4   Characteristic Sequence Transmission and Detection

Characteristic Sequence Detection

In case atmospheric duct exists, the characteristic sequence from remote cell can

reach a local cell in UpPTS of special subframe or uplink subframe, depending on the

physical distance between the eNodeBs.

A cell involved in atmospheric duct is able to detect the characteristic sequences,

during its uplink traffic. The status of characteristic sequence detection are

updated in the EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCharSeqDetectionStatus

attribute and the detected information about characteristic sequences are recorded

in the INTERNAL\_PER\_CELL\_DUCT\_INTERFERENCE\_REPORT event.

To enable flexible characteristic sequence detection for the partial overlapped

bandwidth among the carriers, the value of the

EUtranCellTDD.earfcn attribute minus the lowest channel

number of the EUtranCellTDD.freqBand attribute minus the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntFlexibleDetectionOffset attribute need

to be divided by 3. That is the TDD cells and carriers in the same

operating band must be on a raster of 300 kHz for enabling flexible characteristic

sequence detection.

## 3.4 Duct Interference Reduction

In case the number of detected characteristic sequences is equal to or larger than the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntPerfTuning.ductIntRedTriggerThr threshold in

a detection period around 22 minutes, the local cell performs an operation of Special

Subframe Pattern fallback, as shown in Figure 5.

The fallback is from SSP6 or SSP7 to SSP5 to extend the duration of the guard period

between downlink and uplink traffic. This extension results in interference reduction

between remote cells. In carrier aggregation, the local cells mute the downlink

transmission in the PDSCH region of the special subframe for

interference reduction between remote cells.

The status of duct interference reduction is updated in the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntReductionStatus attribute.

The SSP configuration is recovered to SSP6 or SSP7 or

downlink transmission in the PDSCH region of the special

subframe becomes unmuted, if the number of detected

characteristic sequences is equal to or lower than the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntPerfTuning.ductIntRedRecovThr.

The current SSP is updated in the EUtranCellTDD.ductIntSspStatus, and

transmitted to all UEs in the cell by system information.

Figure 5   SSP Fall Back

## 3.5 Duct Interference Reduction Suppression

This function enables the suppression of duct interference reduction

on uplink symbols to increase duct interference tolerance

distance.

It is possible to configure the range of OFDM symbols starting from the first symbol of

UpPTS. Detected duct interference characteristic sequences on those symbols are ignored

for reduction operation. The number of symbols to ignore can be configured. This way,

the possibility of SSP fallback or downlink muting decreases, which can mitigate

downlink traffic reduction.

The EUtranCellTDD.ductIntRedSuppressActPosition attribute serves to

configure duct interference reduction suppression in active symbol positions. This

suppression increases duct interference tolerance distance based on the number of guard

period symbols.

For

example, two UpPTS symbols do not carry uplink traffic if the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntRedSuppressActPosition attribute is set to

2. In this case, the distance of duct interference tolerance can be

extended by about 40 km.

Duct interference reduction suppression only supports the reduction function. It does not

support the detection and location functions.

## 3.6 CRS Muting

This function enables Cell-specific Reference Signal

(CRS) muting in the

DwPTS

PDSCH region to mitigate uplink interference. CRS muting has different muting modes and

works only if downlink muting is in reduction mode.

If the Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled,

whether

CRS muting is enabled or not depends on the configuration of the

EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCrsMutingMode attribute.

If downlink muting is used in the

DwPTS

PDSCH region to reduce  duct

interference to remote cells, CRSs can be muted in the

DwPTS

PDSCH region. This helps to

reduce

duct interference further.

This function supports only TDD configuration 2.

The EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCrsMutingMode attribute serves to configure

the CRS muting mode.

The following muting modes are

available::

Because of the non-standard nature of the solution, the stability of network KPIs depends

on both the network parameter settings and the UE device fleet.

# 4 Network Impact of Atmospheric Duct Interference Reduction

The feature improves the uplink throughput by reducing the atmospheric duct interference

on uplink subframes.

Capacity and Performance

In case the UE uplink traffic is ongoing in duct interference environment, the uplink

SINR improves.

Interference is reduced when duct interference occurs on an eNodeB with the Carrier

Aggregation feature enabled and for cells with arbitrary bandwidth.

Cell downlink capacity loss is decreased in case of low RSSI level.

Configuring the characteristic information manually instead of using the ECGI

provides flexibility when generating characteristic sequences.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

number of the EUtranCellTDD.freqBand is not a multiple of 3.

Capacity and Performance

Uplink interfence is reduced. This can be observed with the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwr and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrSfn counters.

does not check whether the carriers are aligned on the subcarrier level. To ensure

flexible characteristic sequence detection and mitigation, the TDD cells and

carriers in the same operating band have to be on a raster of 300 kHz.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement is supported on the following AAS radios:

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                  |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following functions:

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Through the reduction of duct interference suppression, the distance of duct interference tolerance is extended and downlink traffic reduction is mitigated.
- Applying the different CRS muting modes in the PDSCH region of special subframes, duct interference can be further reduced.

Capacity and Performance

The observability of CRS muting in the DwPTS PDSCH region is enabled through an

introduced PM counter. For more information, see Operation.

The suppression of duct interference reduction might improve

the following

KPIs:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput
- Average DL UE Latency

CRS muting helps mitigate uplink interference to remote cells but it might have a

negative impact on the performance of the local cell. This can be observed through

the following changes:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput might decrease.
- Average DL Packet Error Loss Rate might increase.
- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput might decrease.
- Average UL Packet Loss Rate might increase.

Operation

This feature enhancement is operable on cell level and introduces the following two

attributes:

- The EUtranCellTDD.ductIntRedSuppressActPosition attribute serves to configure duct interference reduction suppression in active symbol positions. This suppression increases duct interference tolerance distance based on the number of guard period symbols. Duct interference reduction suppression supports only the reduction function. It does not support the slope detection and location functions.
- The EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCrsMutingMode attribute serves to configure the CRS muting mode for carrier aggregation in the DwPTS PDSCH region to reduce duct interference further. CRS muting for carrier aggregation supports only the reduction function. The following muting modes are available: Table 6 CRS Muting Modes Attribute Value of EUtranCellTDD.ductIntCrsMutingMode Muting Mode NOT\_MUTING CRSs are not muted in DwPTS PDSCH region of special subframe. PARTIAL\_MUTING CRSs are muted in DwPTS PDSCH region of special subframe except for the central six PRBs. FULL\_MUTING CRSs are muted in whole DwPTS PDSCH region of special subframe.

This feature enhancement introduces the

EUtranCellTDD.pmDuctIntPdschBlankedTti PM counter for the

observability of CRS muting in the

DwPTS

PDSCH.
