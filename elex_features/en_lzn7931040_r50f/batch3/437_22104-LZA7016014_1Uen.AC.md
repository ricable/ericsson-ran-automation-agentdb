Summary

The ASGH-Based A/B Testing Framework feature provides an efficient way to test the

network performance of functions.

The possibility to distribute users randomly between subscriber groups enables the

testing of different parameterization simultaneously in the same node and cell.

This feature helps to evaluate a new functionality while running it simultaneously

with existing functionality in the same environment without a need for long weeks of

testing time.

A selection probability mechanism is also added to the UE selection procedure. A/B

testing is implemented with the use of a percentage-based selection probability

mechanism in the trigger-list-based UE selection procedure into advanced subscriber

groups. This mechanism defines a percentage-based probability which determines that

a user is included in a subscriber group if all given conditions are fulfilled. This

mechanism helps to implement A/B testing.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of ASGH-Based A/B Testing Framework

The ASGH-Based A/B Testing Framework feature collects and compares the KPIs of several

subscriber groups for an efficient way of measuring performance of a

function.

The ASGH-Based A/B Testing Framework feature can be used for A/B performance testing of

parameters available in the SubscriberGroupProfile MO.

The feature introduces a selection probability mechanism that is added to the UE

selection procedure. This mechanism uses the

SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute. The

selection probability mechanism defines a percentage-based probability that determines

which subscriber group the user is included in. This mechanism helps with the

implementation of A/B Testing on the ASGH Framework, which leads to evaluate performance

efficiently.

Example 1

A/B testing is used to evaluate the performance of a new or legacy function

efficiently. This is done by dividing UEs into the two following groups:

| Group A   |    | Has the monitored function turned on.   |
|-----------|----|-----------------------------------------|
|           |    |                                         |
| Group B   |    | Has the monitored function turned off.  |

The KPI data from each group is collected in one batch and compared with the help of

flexible counters.

Example 2

The SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute is set

according to Table 2 if two groups (group

A, group B) exist with the following characteristics:

- Group A has the highest priority.
- Group B has the lowest priority.
- The same subscriber trigger conditions apply for both groups.

Table 2   Selection Probability Values for Group A and Group B

| UE Distribution Ratio  (Group A : Group B)   |   Value of the                                         SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability                                     Attribute for Group A  (%) |   Value of the                                         SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability                                     Attribute for Group B  (%) |

| 2 : 3                                        |                                                                                                                                                                40 |                                                                                                                                                               100 |

Example 3

The SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute is set

according to Table 3 if three groups

(group A, group B, group C) exist with the following characteristics:

- Group A has the highest priority.
- Group B has the second highest priority.
- Group C has the lowest priority.
- The same subscriber trigger conditions apply for all groups.
