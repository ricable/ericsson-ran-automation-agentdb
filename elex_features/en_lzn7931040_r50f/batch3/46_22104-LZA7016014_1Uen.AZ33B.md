# 1 Streaming of Events Overview

This feature allows for the streaming of traces to a customer without waiting for

each ROP to be completed.

| Value Package Name     | RAN Data Collection                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0431                                                                |

| Access Type            | LTE                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								radio. |

Summary

Although they are similar to normal trace collecting, using the Streaming of Events

feature puts additional load on the following elements:

- Node processor
- Memory use
- O&amp;M link capacity

This feature allows for the streaming of traces to a customer without waiting for

each ROP to be completed. Live cell event traces are streamed through TCP. UE traces

are streamed through UDP.

Additional Information

For more information and related topics, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 32.421, Trace concepts and requirements
- 3GPP TS 32.422, Trace control and configuration management
- 3GPP TS 32.423, Trace data definition and management

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Streaming of Events

The feature has

dependencies with other features that have an impact on cell event

tracing.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

| Feature                                                                     | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PM-Initiated UE Measurements (FAJ 121                                 0667) | Related        | UE measurements include at least one specific PM event in a Cell                                 Trace or UE Trace Subscription Profile. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The

current PM event streaming solution for UE trace is undergoing deprecation, which is

expected to be completed in

24.Q4.

Network Requirements

This feature requires a stable connection to stream traces over the O&amp;M network.

Unstable connections might cause data loss.

# 3 Feature Operation of Streaming of Events

The

feature enables traces streaming over the O&amp;M network to the receiver system.

Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1 shows traces streaming over the O&amp;M

network to the receiver system.

Figure 1   Traces Streaming over the O&amp;M Network to the Receiver System

Process Steps

The feature flow consists of the following main process steps:

1. The customer nominates the IP address and port of the receiver system for each cell trace and IP address for each UE Trace. These ports and addresses can be different for each trace. Cell Traces are streamed using TCP while UE Traces are streamed using UDP. All streaming configuration is performed in the Operations Support System (OSS). The receiver system also has to be configured to collect the streaming traces over TCP or UDP.
2. Stream indicators are included in stream packets and contain administrative information about the trace. These indicator fields can be used by the receiver system to help identify when event stream packets are lost or are received in incorrect order. For UDP traces, these stream indicators are included at the beginning of all streamed packets, while for TCP traces, they are included at the start of the stream and after any data loss in the stream. Data loss occurs when the node send queue buffer overflows and new data cannot be added to the queue.

For more information on Cell Trace and UE Trace, see

Manage Performance for the Baseband Radio Node.

# 4 Network Impact of Streaming of Events

The feature effects the capacity and performance of the network by putting additional

load on the Uplink.

Capacity and Performance

The feature puts additional load on the node processor, memory use, and O&amp;M link

capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Functionality for Streaming Features

These features make it possible to stream traces to a receiver system.

In the Streaming of PM Events feature, the traces contain the same data as in cell trace

ROP files. For more information, see Streaming of PM Events.

In the

Streaming

of Events feature, the traces contain the same data as in cell trace

or UE Trace ROP files. For more information, see

Streaming of Events.

# 9 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 9.1 24.Q4.0: PM Event Streaming over FQDN

This feature enhancement provides

support of FQDN for streaming of PM events for cell trace.

|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4993             | FAJ 121 0760          |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                 | Optional              |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports FQDN entries for cell trace streaming setup to

complement existing IP and port options.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Using FQDN enables mapping new IP addresses if the host IP address changes.
- Hostnames are easier to remember than IP addresses.
- Organizations can use a domain name hierarchy that is independent of IP address assignment.

If the host has multiple IP addresses in DNS resolution returning, an IP address will

be randomly selected from the available IP addresses after each reconnection.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- StreamingCapabilities.dnsLookupSupport
- EventJob.streamDestination

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

It is required to use ENM version 24.4 or later to fully benefit from this feature

enhancement with support for setup of PM event stream jobs using FQDN in the user

interface of the ENM PM Initiation and Collection (PMIC) application. Until this

support is available, AMOS commands can be used instead for feature configuration.
