Hardware

For a description of supported hardware, configurations, and configuration

limitations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity in Radio Node Configurations.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of 19-24 Cell Support

The feature increases the number of cells from 18 to 24 on specific Baseband

units.

Supported Configurations

The feature supports configurations up to 24 cells on Baseband units with an equal or

different number of carrier branches on different cells up to the maximum supported

antenna bandwidth. The number of supported cells for a Baseband also depends on the

total number of TX/RX carrier branches and the cell range configured for each

cell.

For a description of supported configurations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity in Radio Node Configurations.

The following Baseband units are supported:

- Baseband 6648
- Baseband 6651

Supported Bandwidth Combinations

For the supported bandwidth combinations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

## 3.1 License Handling

The Feature Resource Missing or the

Inconsistent Configuration  alarm is raised after an

attempt to unlock a cell that is out of the licensed capacity.

The additional text in the alarm indicates that unlocking                                 the cell is not possible, as there is no existing license that                                 allows this action. |

For more information about the alarms, see Inconsistent Configuration and Feature Resource Missing.

Removing or deactivating the license in a node takes effect when the cells are locked and

unlocked, or when the node is restarted. This means that enabled cells are not

immediately affected when the license is removed or deactivated.

3. Unlock the cell.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate 19-24 Cell Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011974 MO instance.
3. Unlock the cell.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 9.1 18.Q4: 24 Cells Supported on Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318, and Baseband 6630 also for TDD

This

feature enhancement supports connecting 24 cells to a single Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318,

or Baseband 6630 . It increases the channel bandwidth, the number of carrier branches, and

the frequency numbers.

| Feature Name:           | 19-24 Cell Support   |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4426         |
| Value Package Name:     | Large eNodeB         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0403         |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  |
| Access Type:            | LTE                  |

With this feature enhancement the operator is able to configure up to 24 cells with a

single Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318 or Baseband 6630 also for TDD. The cells can contain

the combination of two antennas, four antennas, or eight antennas per cell, up to 24

cells. Eight frequency bands and the combination of 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15

MHz, or 20 MHz carrier bandwidth are supported.

Capacity and Performance

Up to 1440 MHz antenna bandwidth is available for TDD.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement operates only on Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318 and Baseband 6630

units.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 9.2 18.Q4: 1560 MHz Antenna Bandwidth Support on Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318 and Baseband 6630

This feature enhancement supports 1560 MHz ABW on Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318 and

Baseband 6630 for TDD and FDD.

| Feature Name:           | 19-24 Cell Support  13-18 Cell Support  7-12 Cell Support   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4426  FAJ 121 4242  FAJ 121 3020                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Large eNodeB                                                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0403                                                |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                         |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                                         |

With this enhancement, increased ABW of 1560 MHz is available on a single Baseband 5216,

Baseband 6318, and Baseband 6630 for TDD and FDD mode.

The enhancement is valid for FDD and TDD mode, when using 19-24 Cell Support, and for TDD

mode only when using the 7-12 Cell Support, or 13-18 Cell Support features.

Capacity and Performance

1560 MHz ABW is available for TDD and FDD.
