# 1 Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling Overview

Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature improves the frequency selective

scheduling utility and benefits the full and large buffer UE

throughput.

Summary

The Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature allows a dynamic switch from

Frequency-Selective Scheduling to Resource Fair resource allocation strategy. This

is applied only when FSS is activated and is controlled by

eUlFssSwitchThresh. This feature improves the Uplink

Frequency Selective Scheduling utility by changing the default resource allocation

strategy from Resource Fair to FSS for the following:

- SRB
- Scheduling Request (SR) response for initial scheduling
- CQI-only transmissions
- Prescheduling

The main benefit of this feature is an improved full and large buffer UE uplink

peak-throughput while maintaining relatively a low interference level. This feature

is recommended to be enabled in scenarios where Uplink Frequency-Selective

Scheduling feature has expected performance gain.

Relatively less benefit can be expected in case the Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation

feature is enabled together with this feature. The number of allocated users per TTI

is expected to be lower than the number allocated when the Dynamic Uplink Resource

Allocation feature is disabled.

The above mentioned resource allocation strategies define the way the scheduler assigns the

spectrum to users, for more information on resource allocation strategies, see

Uplink Frequency-selective Scheduling.

# 2 Dependencies of Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

# 3 Feature Operation of Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature allows a dynamic switch from

Frequency-Selective Scheduling to Resource Fair resource allocation

strategy.

A spectrum utilization estimate is calculated if there is full and large buffer UE

identified by the node. The estimate reflects Frequency Selective Scheduling

fragmentation impact on the full and large buffer UE.

Operational Process

A configurable switch threshold EUtranCellFDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh

or EUtranCellTDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh determines the condition of

switching from Frequency Selective Scheduling to Resource Fair.

If the spectrum utilization estimate is above the threshold, all new transmissions

in that TTI are switched to Resource Fair.

The default resource allocation strategy of the following transmissions is changed

from Resource Fair to Frequency Selective Scheduling to increase Frequency Selective

Scheduling utilization when this feature is enabled:

- Signaling Radio Bearer
- SR response for initial scheduling
- CQI only transmission
- Prescheduling Note: Prescheduling is an optional enhancement which gains benefits in case it is activated.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

The default resource allocation strategy of the previously mentioned transmissions is

changed. When this feature is activated together with the prerequisite feature

Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling, the following steps are implemented:

1. The default Resource Fair resource allocation strategies of the following are changed:
    - SRB
    - SR response for initial scheduling
    - Prescheduling
    - CQI-only transmission to Frequency Selective Scheduling
2. The dynamic switch to Resource Fair is enabled if the value of EUtranCellFDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh or EUtranCellTDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh is not equal to 100.
3. The presence of UEs with full and large buffer in the TTI are identified. The full and large buffer UE is defined as a UE having a high estimated Physical Resource Block (PRB) requirement.
4. The spectrum utilization gain caused by changing FSS to RF is calculated for TTI with full and large buffer UE.
5. If calculation result is above threshold EUtranCellFDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh or EUtranCellTDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh, all new transmissions in that TTI are switched to Resource Fair and pmSchedTtiCellUlResAllocSwitched is increased by one. The sum of pmSchedTtiCellUlResAllocSwitched and pmSchedTtiCellUlResAllocKept denotes the total TTIs with full and large buffer UE identified.

Interoperability with Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature is mutually operable with Flexible Channel Bandwidth, using wideband SRS.

Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling limits the area of scheduled resources

based on Flexible Channel Bandwidth configuration. Measurement acquisition of

channel metrics for each scheduled sub-band is determined by wideband SRS

measurements.

# 4 Network Impact of Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature provides uplink

peak-throughput performance enhancement for full buffer and large buffer UE when Uplink

Frequency-Selective Scheduling is

enabled.

Capacity and Performance

The benefit can be observed through the KPIs of uplink throughput.

Extreme feature benefit can be derived at the expense of Uplink cell interference

level increase. This can be balanced by toning the

eUlFssSwitchThresh parameter.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

In general, ENM version 19.1 or later is required.

ENM version 20.2 or later is required for pmCounters

pmSchedTtiCellUlResAllocSwitched and

pmSchedTtiCellUlResAllocKept.

# 5 Parameters for Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The feature has no affected parameters and introduces the new

Events

# 7 Activate Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

The license key is installed in the node.

The prerequisite Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature is activated.

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012316 MO instance.
2. Set the parameter eUlFssSwitchThresh to a value below 100 to enable scheduling strategy dynamic switch to Resource Fair for UEs configured for FSS.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012316 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling

The dynamic switching of resource allocation strategy from Frequency Selective Scheduling

to Resource Fair of this feature is turned off by default unless the

EUtranCellFDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh or

EUtranCellTDD.eUlFssSwitchThresh parameter is set to a value

different than the default value 100.

An optimized value can be derived from an early field test for feature deployment.
