# 1 Accelerated Inter-Frequency Load Balancing Overview

The feature manages uneven distribution of traffic load in cases with fast and large

traffic variation. This improves UE distribution between different carrier frequencies in a

short period.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature enables the following configurations for load balancing:

- Shorter load balancing cycle length. For example, 5-second cycles instead of 15-second cycles to increase the responsiveness of the network to traffic changes.
- Shorter load balancing sub-cycle length to increase load balancing actions in a cycle. This results in more selected UEs in every second for more even load distribution in the cell.

The feature evens out traffic load between different carrier frequencies and

increases the average downlink throughput for the UE and the cell.

# 3 Feature Operation of Accelerated Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

The feature modifies the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing algorithm, making it more

configurable.

Load balancing between cells is done repeatedly in successive load balancing cycles. The

length of the load balancing cycles can be set by the

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCycle attribute.

The load balancing cycle is divided into a certain number of sub cycles. At each load

balancing sub cycle, a list of connected UEs is scanned and the selection for

measurements is performed. The load balancing sub cycle length determines the time that

the load balancing mechanism waits between attempts to start UE measurements. The load

balancing sub cycle length can be configured with the

LoadBalancingFunction.lbSubCycle attribute.

The maximum number of measurements started for load balancing purposes during a period of

load balancing cycle can be calculated as lbCycle /

lbSubCycle, where lbCycle and

lbSubCycle represent the values of

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCycle and

LoadBalancingFunction.lbSubCycle attributes.

Example 1   Maximum Allowed Number of Measurements

lbCycle = 5s, lbSubCycle = 50ms

The maximum number of measurements started for load balancing purposes during one

load balancing cycle is equal to 100 since 5s/50ms = 100.

| UE Selection for Load Balancing Action |    | The UEs suitable for offload are selected. The suitable UEs are those that                         reported to the source cell that they detected sufficient coverage in a                         target cell.   Some suitable UEs are moved to detected target cells by inter-frequency                         handover. |

# 4 Network Impact of Accelerated Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

The feature increases downlink throughput. It also increases the amount of X2 signaling

when it operates with load information exchange.

Capacity and Performance

X2 signaling is only required when the feature operates with load information

exchange. The shorter the load balancing cycle length, the bigger the amount of X2

signaling used for load balancing purposes.

The average downlink throughput is increased for the UE and the cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature requires ENM version 19.3 or later.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Accelerated Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

The feature enables the configuration of load balancing cycle and load balancing sub

cycle lengths to speed up the traffic load distribution process.

Use the following attributes to configure the feature:

- The load balancing cycle length determines the load balancing reporting periodicity. It can be configured with the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCycle attribute.

- The load balancing cycle is divided into certain number of sub cycles. At each load balancing sub cycle, a list of connected UEs is scanned and the selection for measurements is performed. The load balancing sub cycle length can be configured with the LoadBalancingFunction.lbSubCycle attribute.
