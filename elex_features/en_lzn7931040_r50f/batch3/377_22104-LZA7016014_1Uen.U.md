# 1 Delay Tolerant Receiver Overview

The feature improves coverage in scenarios when radio frequency repeaters are

used.

Summary

The feature can reduce the number of UE drops for UEs moving into or out of the coverage of

the repeater. This is achieved by configuring larger receiver window to deal with

the large difference between the original and the repeated signal.

This feature supports both TDD and FDD. It can be enabled or disabled at cell level.

Example 1   Typical Scenario for Delay Tolerant

Receiver

Figure 1   Typical Scenario for Delay Tolerant Receiver

When multiple connection paths are available with different signal delay,

larger window size is needed to include the repeated signal.

When a UE

connects to the cell on Path1, the delay is compensated by timing advance

adjustment.

When a UE connects to the cell on Path2, through repeater, the

extra delay compared to Path1 is due to the time required for processing in the

repeater.

# 2 Dependencies of Delay Tolerant Receiver

The Delay Tolerant Receiver feature improves the Uplink Multiuser MIMO feature in

scenarios with multipath delay difference larger than 5.5 µs and smaller than 9

µs.

# 3 Feature Operation of Delay Tolerant Receiver

The Delay Tolerant Receiver feature improves uplink performance by enlarging the channel

estimation window size. Hence, multiple paths can be included into the estimated channel,

leading to improved channel estimation.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 2   Normal and Large Window Size for Uplink Channel Estimation

Process Steps

The feature allows to select normal or large window size for PUSCH filter channel

estimation for normal cyclic prefix. This is configured using

EUtranCellFDD.puschNcpChannelEstWindowSize or

EUtranCellTDD.puschNcpChannelEstWindowSize.

# 4 Network Impact of Delay Tolerant Receiver

The Delay Tolerant Receiver feature reduces UE drops by increasing the

coverage.

Capacity and Performance

In cells with large multipath delay difference-between 5.5 µs and 11 µs-if the window

size for uplink channel estimation is set to large, the following applies:

- The cell uplink throughput is increased.
- The UE throughput is increased.
- VoIP Integrity is expected to increase.
- E-RAB retainability is increased.

For scenarios or cells with no large delay difference, enlarging the window size for

channel estimation can slightly decrease uplink throughput.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature requires that ENM 18.1 or later version is used.

# 5 Parameters of Delay Tolerant Receiver

The feature introduces a parameter to switch between the window sizes for PUSCH filter

channel estimation.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Delay Tolerant Receiver

The Delay Tolerant Receiver feature is suitable for scenarios when radio frequency

repeater are used, and cells with large multipath delay difference, between 5.5 µs and

11 µs. In these scenarios it is recommended that the window size is increased.

In other cases normal window size is recommended.
