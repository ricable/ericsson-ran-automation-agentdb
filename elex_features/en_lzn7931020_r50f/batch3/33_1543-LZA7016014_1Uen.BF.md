# 2 Remedy Action for AntennaNearUnit

This alarm is raised when a HW fault is detected that result in no service provided

by the alarming MO. The equipment needs to be replaced.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the faulty RET or TMA.
3. Inspect the fault RET or TMA visually. Condition Actions A cable is missing. Connect a new cable. A cable is disconnected. Reconnect the loose ends. A cable is damaged. Replace it with a new cable. A cable is dirty. Disconnect the cable. Clean the connectors with a suitable cleaning kit Reconnect the cable. Note: In an AIR unit, the RET is integrated and cannot be inspected separately.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Restart the faulty RET or TMA. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Replace the RET or TMA. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment. Note: In an AIR unit, the RET is integrated and cannot be replaced separately. To replace an AIR unit, see the applicable Replace Antenna Integrated Radio Units Operation Instructions in the Radio library.

The additional text can have a (Mixed Mode with other ME)

extension which indicates that it is shared with another Managed Element and possibly in

conflict with another RAN.

## 3.1 Remote Troubleshooting

This alarm is raised when a HW fault is detected that result in no service provided

by the alarming MO. The equipment needs to be replaced.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check alarm history logs and determine if multiple RRUs are raising the alarm. If multiple radio units are raising the alarm, focus troubleshooting on a component that is common to all the units (for example HWAC, Digital Unit or Power).
3. Ensure that any alarms associated with the Digital Unit(s) reporting environmental (Temperature Abnormal) or synchronization or timing (Loss of Tracking) fault are prioritized and addressed first.
4. Check the system configuration to ensure the correct Ericsson Supported SFPs are used (INVRXBG command can be used).
5. Check the alarm history and if the alarm occurrence is infrequent, restart the faulty unit. See Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Continue with the next section.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check RRU Power Supply.
3. Check the circuit breaker, surge protection and cabling.
4. Check and ensure that the power supply or power plant of the site is dimensioned correctly.
5. Power cycle the RRU by toggling the breaker.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Continue with the next section.

## 3.3 Tower Top Troubleshooting

This alarm is raised when a HW fault is detected that result in no service provided

by the alarming MO. The equipment needs to be replaced.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the radio is mounted and installed correctly.
3. Ensure that all power connections and RF cabling are secure.
4. Ensure correct weatherproofing.
5. Check external surge protection device.

    - Check for correct fiber type, that it is not damaged, has correct bend radius and is correctly weatherproofed.
    - Check that the fiber connections are clean.
    - If necessary, replace fiber or defective SFP. For a list of supported SFP modules, see the Spare Pars Catalog document.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Lock the faulty unit. See Lock Board or Manage Hardware Equipment, depending on the CPI library used. Note: If the HW Fault alarm is related to an internal sync link error, the unit can still be used until a replacement unit is available. Postpone locking the board until the unit is replaced.
9. Write a Repair Delivery Note. See Handling Faulty Equipment for more information.
10. Replace the faulty unit. See Replacing Radio Units, Replacing Remote Radio Units. If the alarm is generated from an XMU 02, see Replacing XMU. Note: If the alarm is generated from a radio unit, the whole RBS needs to be replaced, see Replacing RBS.
11. Unlock the installed unit. See Unlock Board or Manage Hardware Equipment depending on the CPI library used.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

12. Reinsert the original hardware.
13. Contact the next level of support and provide log files required by Data Collection Guideline.

## 5.2 Cell Site Troubleshooting

This alarm is raised when a HW fault is detected that result in no service provided

by the alarming MO. The equipment needs to be replaced.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check power supply and cabling:
    - If a cable is missing, connect a new cable.
    - If a cable is disconnected, reconnect the loose ends.
    - If a cable is physically damaged, replace it with a new cable.
    - If a cable is dirty, clean the connections on both ends of the cable. First, disconnect the cable, then use a suitable cleaning kit to clean the connectors. Reconnect the cable.
