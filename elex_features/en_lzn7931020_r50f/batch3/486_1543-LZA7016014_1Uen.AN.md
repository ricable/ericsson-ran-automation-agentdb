# 2 Remedy Action for ExternalENodeBFunction: Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation is not available towards remote eNodeB..

This alarm is raised when the inter-node carrier aggregation service becomes

unavailable, e.g. due to a mismatch of SW versions and/or mandatory capabilities

betweeen local and external gNodeB-DU partners detected during E5 setup, or failures

in underlying resources.

The Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable

alarm with this additional text is raised when the Inter eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

service is not available due to failures in underlying resources.

If the service is unavailable because of problems with Ethernet network, the Ethernet

Link Failure alarm is raised at the same time on the Ethernet port used for

communication with the external eNodeB.

Cause

- IDLe cable is not connected to local DU or remote DU.
- IDLe cable is damaged.
- IDLe cable is not connected to the hop switch.
- Ethernet port at either the local DU or remote DU is disabled or the link is down.
- Ethernet port at external switch is disabled or the link is down.
- External switch is down.
- External switch is restarting.
- VLAN is misconfigured at the switch.

If the connection path has multiple switches, any of the external switches can be

disabled or restarting or any link can be down in the path.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Look for the Ethernet Link Failure primary alarm on the Ethernet port that is used for Elastic RAN. Primary and secondary alarm correlation is described in Manage Faults. The Ethernet port that is used for Elastic RAN can be identified by checking the localPort attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO instances.

If the Ethernet Link Failure primary alarm is present, do the following:

3. Perform the instructions in the Ethernet Link Failure document.

If the Ethernet Link Failure alarm is not present and the Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service

Unavailable alarm is active,

do the following:

4. Examine all external switches and links in the connection path to correct the fault. Any faulty or restarting switch or faulty link in the connection path can cause the Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable alarm.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Check that the VLAN is configured correctly at the switches.
    1. Reconfigure the VLAN if needed.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for ExternalENodeBFunction: Elastic RAN tunnel link latency exceeds maximum allowed value.

This alarm is raised when the inter-node carrier aggregation service becomes

unavailable, e.g. due to a mismatch of SW versions and/or mandatory capabilities

betweeen local and external gNodeB-DU partners detected during E5 setup, or failures

in underlying resources.

This alarm is raised with this additional text, if the E-RAN tunnel link latency

exceeds the maximum allowed value when the Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration

function of the Elastic RAN feature is used. For more information on the maximum

allowed value of E-RAN tunnel link latency, see Elastic RAN.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Observe the E-RAN tunnel link latency using the following read-only attributes:

- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency1minAvg
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency15minHWM
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency24hrsHWM

3. Minimize the E-RAN tunnel link latency by optimizing the network configuration. For more information on network configuration, see the following documentation: Manage Network Functions Manage Network Synchronization Network Synchronization Guidelines

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction

This alarm is raised when the inter-node carrier aggregation service becomes

unavailable, e.g. due to a mismatch of SW versions and/or mandatory capabilities

betweeen local and external gNodeB-DU partners detected during E5 setup, or failures

in underlying resources.

The alarm is raised with this additional text in networks where inter-node carrier

aggregation service is used with nodes running on different software versions.

Inter-node carrier aggregation can become unavailable as a result of either or both

of the following conditions:

- The software versions of the server and the client node are not compatible.
- One of the nodes does not support a mandatory capability that is required for inter-node carrier aggregation.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Upgrade the nodes to compatible software versions. For more information on the compatible software versions in each release, see Compliance and Compatibility.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
