# 2 Remedy Action for EUtranCellFDD, ExtTrx, NbIotCel, NodeBLocalCell and Trx: Maximum number of standards on RF port = &lt;value=A, B,...&gt; in downlink exceeded. &lt;Standard 1&gt;, &lt;Standard 2&gt;[, ..., &lt;Standard N&gt;] already set up

If this AdditionalText appears, the Radio unit has already reached its upper limit on

number of supported standards on the specified RF port.

The AdditionalText can contain the string (Mixed Mode with other

ME), indicating that the Radio Unit is shared with an external

Managed Element (Radio node) with separate MO configuration. For such cases,

troubleshooting needs to be done for both Radio nodes together. Always check whether

the configuration of the Mixed Mode Radio is consistent with the one recommended in

the Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

This procedure is valid for one single Baseband node with three standards, and in

this case, the AdditionalText does not contain the (Mixed Mode with other

ME) string.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the relevant SectorEquipmentFunction MO from the cell or TRX or extension TRX. For EUtranCellFDD and NbIotCell, first identify the referred disabled SectorCarrier MO, which in turn refers to the SectorEquipmentFunction. For NodeBLocalCell, first identify the referred disabled NodeBSectorCarrier, which in turn refers to the SectorEquipmentFunction. Trx and ExtTrx refer to SectorEquipmentFunction directly.
3. Check the number of standards that use the SectorEquipmentFunction, that is, the standards that have MOs reserving the SectorEquipmentFunction MO. SectorCarrier counts as LTE, NodeBSectorCarrier as WCDMA, and Trx and ExtTrx as GSM.
4. Check that the standards identified in Step 3, except of the standard of the alarming MO, match the standards listed in the AdditionalText part &lt;Standard 1&gt;, &lt;Standard 2&gt;[, ..., &lt;Standard N&gt;].
    - If they match, and the number of standards is 3, proceed with Step 5.
    - If they match, and the number of standards is less than 3, proceed with Step 8.
    - If they don't match, proceed with Step 8.
5. If the number of standards using the SectorEquipmentFunction is 3, check that explicit mapping of cells and TRXs to RF branches is used. The attribute rfBranchTxRef must be set for each SectorCarrier, NodeBSectorCarrier and Trx and ExtTrx MO referring to the SectorEquipmentFunction.
    - If this is fulfilled for all cells and TRXs, proceed with Step 6.
    - If this is not fulfilled for all cells and TRXs, proceed with Step 9.
6. Identify the RfBranch MO that corresponds to RF port pointed out in the AdditionalText part &lt;value=A, B,...&gt;. Check how many standards are mapped towards that specific RfBranch.
7. Check that the standards identified in Step 6 match the standards listed in the AdditionalText part &lt;Standard 1&gt;, &lt;Standard 2&gt;[, ..., &lt;Standard N&gt;].
    - If they don't match, proceed with Step 8.
    - If they match, proceed with Step 9.
8. If the identified standards do not match the standards listed in the AdditionalText, or, if they match but the number of standards is less than 3:
    1. Lock the alarming cell or TRX.
    2. Unlock the cell or TRX. Note: The ExtTrx is only used for the GSM feature Combined Cell. The ExtTrx MO does not have the attribute administrativeState, instead the parent Trx MO should be locked/unlocked. For more Combined Cell information, see Manage Radio Network GSM and GSM RAN User Description, Combined Cell.
    3. If the alarm remains, ensure that the baseband and radio units are enabled and unlocked. For instructions on how to unlock a unit, see Manage Hardware Equipment or Unlock Board depending on the library that you are using.
    4. Lock the alarming cell or TRX.
    5. Unlock the cell or TRX.
    6. If the alarm remains, restart the radio. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment or Restart Board depending on the library that you are using.
    7. If the alarm remains, restart the alarming node. For more information, seeRestart Node or Emergency Recover Node on Site depending on the library that you are using.
    8. If the alarm remains, consult the next level of maintenance support. Further actions are outside the scope of this instruction.
9. Perform explicit (re-)configuration of the rfBranchTxRef attributes in order to avoid too many standards per RF port. For more details, see the applicable procedure for the allocation fo RF port in Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

10. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for EUtranCellFDD, ExtTrx, NbIotCell, NodeBLocalCell and Trx: Maximum number of standards on RF port = &lt;value=A, B,...&gt; in downlink exceeded. &lt;Standard 1&gt;, &lt;Standard 2&gt;[, ..., &lt;Standard N&gt;] already set up (Mixed Mode with other ME)

number of supported standards on the specified RF port.

The AdditionalText can contain the string (Mixed Mode with other

ME), indicating that the Radio Unit is shared with an external

Managed Element (Radio node) with separate MO configuration. For such cases,

the configuration of the Mixed Mode Radio is consistent with the one recommended in

the Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the relevant SectorEquipmentFunction MO from the cell or TRX. For EUtranCellFDD and NbIotCell, first identify the referred disabled SectorCarrier MO, which in turn refers to the SectorEquipmentFunction. For NodeBLocalCell, first identify the referred disabled NodeBSectorCarrier, which in turn refers to the SectorEquipmentFunction. Trx and ExtTrx refer to SectorEquipmentFunction directly.
3. Find the external Radio node, which shares sector with the examined Radio node. The external node could be either Baseband Radio Node, WCDMA DU Radio Node, or GSM DU Radio Node.
4. Check which standards are using the SectorEquipmentFunction in the own node, that is, the standards which have MOs reserving the SectorEquipmentFunction MO. SectorCarrier counts as LTE, NodeBSectorCarrier as WCDMA, Trx and ExtTrx as GSM.
5. Check which standards use the same sector in the external node. If the external node is a Baseband Radio node, identify the standards in the same way as for the alarming Radio node in Step 4.
6. Identify the total number of standards in both nodes by aggregating the results from Step 4 and Step 5.
7. Check that the standards identified in Step 6, except of the standard of the alarming MO, match the standards listed in the AdditionalText part &lt;Standard 1&gt;, &lt;Standard 2&gt;[, ..., &lt;Standard N&gt;].
    - If they match, and the number of standards is 3, proceed with Step 8.
    - If they match, and the number of standards is less than 3, proceed with Step 11.
    - If they don't match, proceed with Step 11.
8. If the number of standards using the SectorEquipmentFunction is 3 and they match the standards listed in AdditionalText, check that explicit mapping of cells and TRXs to RF branches is used in all Baseband Radio Nodes. The attribute rfBranchTxRef must be set for each SectorCarrier, NodeBSectorCarrier, Trx and ExtTrx MO referring to the SectorEquipmentFunction. For WCDMA and GSM DU Radio Nodes, explicit mapping is always used.
    - If this is fulfilled for all cells, TRXs, proceed with Step 9.
    - If this is not fulfilled for all cells, TRXs, proceed with Step 12.
9. For Baseband nodes, identify the RfBranch MO that corresponds to RF port pointed out in the AdditionalText part &lt;value=A, B,...&gt;. Check how many standards are mapped towards that specific RfBranch. For WCDMA DU Radio Node, check if the concerned Radio Unit exists in the sector and if there is an AntennaBranch MO created for the concerned RF port; see WCDMA RBS Configuration Guidelines in the WCDMA DU Radio Node library. MCTRI for the TRXC MO in BSC. For details, see MCPA Guideline in the GSM RAN library.
10. Check that the standards identified in Step 9 match the standards listed in the AdditionalText part For GSM DU Radio Node, check the actual TRX to MCPA mapping by using the Display MCTR Configuration function in the OMT and check the settings of the parameter &lt;Standard 1&gt;, &lt;Standard 2&gt;[, ..., &lt;Standard N&gt;].
    - If they don't match, proceed with Step 11.
    - If they match, proceed with Step 12.
11. If the identified standards do not match the standards listed in the AdditionalText, or, if they match but the number of standards is less than 3:
    1. Lock the alarming cell or TRX.
    2. Unlock the cell or TRX. Note: The ExtTrxFor GSM DU Radio Node, check the actual TRX to MCPA mapping by using the is only used for the GSM feature Combined Cell. The ExtTrx MO does not have the attribute administrativeState, instead the parent Trx MO should be locked/unlocked. For more Combined Cell information, see Manage Radio Network GSM and GSM RAN User Description, Combined Cell.
    3. If the alarm remains, ensure that the baseband and radio units are enabled and unlocked. For instructions on how to unlock a unit, see Manage Hardware Equipment or Unlock Board depending on the library that you are using.
    4. Lock the alarming cell or TRX.
    5. Unlock the cell or TRX.

# 14 Remedy Action for NodeBLocalCell, Trx, and ExtTrx: No available carrier path Not enough IQ slots on internal CPRI (Mixed Mode with other ME)

This alarm is raised when there are not enough IQ slots on the internal CPRI link to

allocate the requested carrier bandwidth.

The reason for the alarm is one of the following:

- There are not enough contiguous IQ slots for the requested carrier bandwidth because of frequent carrier setup and removal, causing IQ slot fragmentation.
- The requested carrier bandwidth is larger than the available IQ slots.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Consult the RDS CPI for guidance on minimizing internal CPRI use.
3. Restart the IRU. If the RDS CPI indicates that the configuration does not exceed the available IQ slots on the internal CPRI connection, restarting the IRU rearranges the IQ slot allocation on the internal CPRI link, which can remove fragmentation.
4. Remove a carrier from the Baseband reporting the alarm. This reduces resource demand on the internal CPRI link.
5. Remove a carrier from another Baseband or Indoor Connect 8855 attached to the IRU. This reduces other resource demands on the CPRI link so the requirements for the failing carrier can be satisfied.
6. Rearrange the CPRI connections from the Baseband and Indoor Connect 8855 to the IRU. This can optimize the traffic flows to reduce the resource demand on the internal CPRI link.
