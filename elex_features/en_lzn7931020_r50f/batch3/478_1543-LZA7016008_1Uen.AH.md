# 2 Remedy Action for RdiPort: Tx Insertion Loss High[ (Mixed Mode with other ME)]

The insertion loss in the transmit direction of the cable connecting the IRU to the

RD is above the acceptable threshold. The alarm is raised due to any of the

following reasons:

- The RD cable length between the IRU and the RD is longer than the recommended maximum.
- The wrong type of cable is used between the IRU and the RD.
- The RD cable is physically damaged.

The green RD indicator is lit.

The RD unit continues to carry traffic, but the downlink RF performance may be

degraded.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the alarm has not automatically been

cleared by the system.

Required Tools and Equipment

Obtain a cable with the following requirements:

- A cable with shorter length than the recommended maximum.
- A cable with the correct cable type.
- A cable that is not physically damaged.

For more information about the cable requirements, see RDI Guidelines.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Replace the faulty cable.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for RdiPort: Rx Insertion Loss High[ (Mixed Mode with other ME)]

The insertion loss in the receive direction of the cable connecting the IRU to the RD

is above the acceptable threshold. The alarm is raised due to any of the following

reasons:

- The RD cable length between the IRU and the RD is longer than the recommended maximum.
- The wrong type of cable is used between the IRU and the RD.
- The RD cable is physically damaged.

The green RD indicator is lit.

The RD unit continues to carry traffic, but the uplink RF performance may be

degraded.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the alarm has not automatically been

cleared by the system.

Required Tools and Equipment

Obtain a cable with the following requirements:

- A cable with shorter length than the recommended maximum.
- A cable with the correct cable type.
- A cable that is not physically damaged.

For more information about the cable requirements, see RDI Guidelines.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Replace the faulty cable.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for RdiPort: Tx Insertion Loss Low[ (Mixed Mode with other ME)]

The insertion loss in the transmit direction of the cable connecting the IRU to the

RD is below the acceptable threshold. The alarm is raised due to any of the

following reasons:

- The RD cable length between the IRU and the RD is shorter than the recommended minimum.
- The wrong type of cable is used between the IRU and the RD.
- The RD cable is physically damaged.

The green RD indicator is flashing.

The RD unit cannot carry any traffic.

# 6 Remedy Action for RdiPort: Insertion Loss differential between two branches High

The insertion loss differential between branch A and branch B is over the acceptable

threshold. The alarm is raised due to any of the following reasons:

- The RD cable is broken somewhere in the middle or between different patch panel points.
- The RJ-45 connector is not attached properly to the cable on either end.
- The RD cable is physically damaged.

The green RD indicator is lit.

The RD unit continues to carry traffic, but the downlink and uplink RF performance

may be degraded.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the alarm has not automatically been

cleared by the system.
