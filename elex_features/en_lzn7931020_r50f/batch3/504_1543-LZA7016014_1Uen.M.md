# 2 Remedy Actions for EUtranCellFDD, EUtranCellTDD

This alarm is raised when not enough downlink transceiver power is detected on cell

carrier branch, and recovery by cell MO re-setup is not successful.

The No DL TX Power Detector feature is configured to do an automatic cell lock and

unlock action when no DL TX Power is detected. If after cell lock and unlock, the

issue still occurs, the alarm is raised. Raised alarm is not ceased until the

recovery actions described below are successful.

Only applicable for the Baseband Radio Node.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the value of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxpower attribute against radio recommendations and update the value if necessary. The value must be the recommended value or higher. The output power configured below the recommended level can lead to false detection of not enough downlink transceiver power resulting in this alarm. Therefore, we recommend that users set the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxpower attribute to no lower than the recommended level. For more information, see the Radio Description of the corresponding radio unit.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Restart the radio where the affected cell is configured and wait at least 15 minutes after cell activation. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Restart the node and wait at least 15 minutes after cell activation. For more information, see Emergency Recover Node on Site.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Actions for NodeBLocalCell

This alarm is raised when not enough downlink transceiver power is detected on cell

carrier branch, and recovery by cell MO re-setup is not successful.

The No DL TX Power Detector feature is configured to do an automatic cell lock and

unlock action when no DL TX Power is detected. If after cell lock and unlock, the

issue still occurs, the alarm is raised. Raised alarm is not ceased until the

recovery actions described below are successful.

Only applicable for the Baseband Radio Node.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the value of the NodeBSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxpower attribute against radio recommendations and update the value if necessary. The value must be the recommended value or higher. The output power configured below the recommended level can lead to false detection of not enough downlink transceiver power resulting in this alarm. Therefore, we recommend that users set the NodeBSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxpower attribute to no lower than the recommended level.

# 4 Remedy Actions for NRSectorCarrier: No TX power detected on sector carrier for equipment associated with MO listed in Additional Information. noTxPowerAction=NO\_ACTION.

This alarm is raised when not enough downlink transceiver power is detected

on

the NR sector carrier, and recovery by the sector carrier re-setup is not

successful.

This alarm is raised when not enough downlink transceiver power is detected on the NR

sector carrier.

The raised alarm is not ceased until the recovery actions described below are

successful.

Prerequisites

This

alarm

only applies if the 5GA Advanced Cell Supervision feature is active.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the value of the NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxpower attribute against radio recommendations and update the value if necessary. The value must be the recommended value or higher. The output power configured below the recommended level can lead to false detection of not enough downlink transceiver power resulting in this alarm. Therefore, we recommend that users set the NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxpower attribute to no lower than the recommended level. For more information, see the Radio Description of the corresponding radio unit.
3. Lock and unlock the NRSectorCarrier MO.
4. Lock and unlock the NRCellDU MO.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Identify the radio on which the faulty carrier is detected, using the additional information referring to the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
6. Restart the radio where the affected sector carrier is configured and wait at least 15 minutes after the NR cell activation. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

7. Restart the node and wait at least 15 minutes after the NR cell activation. For more information, see Emergency Recovery Node on Site.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Actions for NRSectorCarrier: No TX power detected on sector carrier for equipment associated with MO listed in Additional Information. noTxPowerAction=SC\_AND\_CELL\_RESTART.

This alarm is raised when not enough downlink transceiver power is detected

on

the NR sector carrier, and recovery by the sector carrier re-setup is not

successful.

An automatic NR sector carrier re-setup is initiated when not enough

downlink

TX power is detected. If the issue still occurs after sector

carrier re-setup, the Downlink TX No Power Detected is

raised. The

raised

alarm is not ceased until the recovery actions described below are successful.
