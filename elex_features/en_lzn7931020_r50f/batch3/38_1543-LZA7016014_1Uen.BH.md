# 1 Introduction

This instruction describes how to recover a node to which the operator has lost remote

Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) access.

When the procedure is completed, the node is recovered and the remote O&amp;M access is

restored.

Normal O&amp;M communication includes the following:

- A Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server providing remote access to certain files in the node
- An SFTP client used by the node to send and retrieve data from an external source
- Remote O&amp;M access using Secure Shell (SSH) client or Transport Layer Security (TLS) client
- Node management tools accessible from the Radio Node Portal

When remote O&amp;M contact is lost it means that communication cannot be established using a

Node Management Tool, any SSH client, or TLS client from a remote location. The node can still

be active carrying payload traffic.

The likely causes of losing the remote O&amp;M contact with the node are as follows:

- The Operation and Maintenance Center (OMC) equipment has failed
- The O&amp;M transport network has failed
- The node has failed due to power supply failure on site
- The node has failed due to site climate control equipment failure causing the node to turn itself off to prevent overheating and permanent damage
- The node has failed due to faulty node hardware, Software (SW), configuration, or incorrect manual intervention
- The node has failed due to violation of system limits, lack of memory or other resources for example traffic overload

This document only describes the cases where the node has failed.

## 1.1 Prerequisites

Before starting the procedure, ensure that the following is fulfilled:

- The O&amp;M communication with the node is lost and it is not possible to start the Node Management Tool from a remote location. Other transport network nodes pointing at the node can issue transmission alarms.
- Alarms from the node received at the Network Management System are investigated and give no clear indication of the root cause. Note: For the procedure to follow when the Heartbeat Failure alarm is displayed, see the Heartbeat Failure Operating Instructions in the Ericsson Network Manager library.
- No other relevant transport network problem has been identified.

Before going to the site, investigate and correct all external reasons for losing the remote

O&amp;M contact with the node.

The following are examples of reasons for losing contact with the node:

- Failed power supply caused by a power outage where the equipment is located.
- Failed site climate control equipment causing the node to turn itself off to prevent overheating and permanent damage.
- Failed transmission links or equipment.
- Other failed Internet Protocol (IP) traffic routing equipment.

Before going to the site, data collection can be performed by the Emergency Access (EA) as

described in

Data Collection Guideline.

For a successfully integrated node, access the Emergency Access tool through the Radio Node

Portal. To access the Radio Node Portal, enter the root URL address of the node in the web

browser. For more information, see Radio Node Portal.

If data collection by EA is not possible from a remote location, it can be performed on

site.

The following prerequisites apply to all alarm handling instructions:

- The following documents have been read and understood: Handling Faulty Equipment Personal Health and Safety Information System Safety Information
- Other documentation referenced within the alarm operating instruction is available.
- Access to a node management tool is secured, if required.
- Access to the site is secured, if on-site activities are required.

### 1.1.1 Documents

When going to site, ensure that the documents referred to in this

document are available.

For all on-site activities, ensure to have knowledge and take precautions

as described in the documents Personal Health and Safety

Information and System Safety Information.

### 1.1.2 Tools

Before going to the site, ensure to bring a computer. The computer

must have:

- a functioning Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server installed and available for storage and transfer of backup and Upgrade Package (UP) to the node, through the Local Maintenance Terminal (LMT) port on the unit.
- a Linux or any SSH client, if logging on to the node Ericsson Command Line Interface (CLI) as a User or a Maintenance User using an SSH client. The Maintenance User is only used if it is not possible to log on to the node as a User. Use a Transport Layer Security (TLS) client if possible when you log on as a Maintenance User. If not, the SSH client is also acceptable. More information is found in Manage User Access.
- a Linux shell, or corresponding, if logging on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User using a TLS client. For Linux shell, openssl can be used as TLS client. TLS and the Maintenance User is only used if it is not possible to log on to the node as a User by the Ericsson CLI port using an SSH client. The computer must have stand-alone mode credentials. For information on creating stand-alone mode credentials, see Emergency Recover Node On Site. Note: The sam.p12 file can be saved in any directory. Extract the client key from the sam.p12 file using the following command: openssl pkcs12 -in sam.p12 -clcerts -out client.pem. A client.pem file is created on the computer. Extract the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates from the sam.p12 file using the following command: openssl pkcs12 -in sam.p12 -cacerts -out ca.pem -nodes -nokeys.

### 1.1.3 Conditions

Before going to the site, ensure that the following conditions

are met:

- The IP address for the computer connected to the node LMT port is available, and is on the same subnet as the node LMT port. The username and password for the SFTP server on the computer are available.
- The IP address for the node LMT port and the SSH port number are available, if logging on to the node Ericsson CLI as a User or a Maintenance User using an SSH client. The SSH-port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. The username and password for the SSH logon are available.
- The IP address for the node LMT port and the TLS port number are available, if logging on to the node Ericsson CLI as a Maintenance User using a TLS client. The TLS port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliTls TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 9830. A client certificate matching the trust category specified for the Maintenance User is available. A Maintenance User must have been configured at node integration.
- The node O&amp;M IP address and the NETCONF port number are available.
- The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server IP address is available.
- Copies of an appropriate backup and the applicable UP are stored on the computer.
- A replacement unit is available, preferably pre-integrated with SW and the site unique configuration. For information, see document Replace Baseband Using ENM

# 2 Workflow

This section describes the workflow for node outage analysis, node

recovery, and how to restore remote O&amp;M access.

## 2.1 Analyze and Correct Faults

Analyze the symptoms to locate the fault. Correct the faults with the proposed

actions.

If none of the fault types described fit the problem and if the problem cannot be

corrected, perform data collection as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, contact the next level of

maintenance support.

Additional information about the fault can be found in log files, see document Manage Software.

For information on optical indicators, see document Indicators, Buttons, and Switches. For information on user roles,

see documents Manage User

Access.

A proposed analysis flow is provided below.

Figure 1 shows the workflow on how to analyze and

correct faults:

Figure 1   Workflow on how to Analyze and Correct Faults

Steps

To analyze and correct faults do the following:

1. Verify power supply to the node. If one or more optical indicators on the unit are on, there is power supply to the node. Go to Step 2. If all optical indicators on the unit are off, verify power supply to the node from the Power Distribution Unit (PDU). If there is no power supply to the node, correct the fault and ensure node power supply. If one or more optical indicators on the unit are on, go to Step 2. If power is distributed to the node and all optical indicators are still off, HW fault is suspected on the unit. Perform data collection as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, go to Replace Unit and Restore Node.
2. If the Fault optical indicator is off and the Operational optical indicator is steady on, go to Step 10.
3. If the Operational optical indicator is flashing slowly 0.5 Hz on the unit, the node has performed automatic recovery as described in document Manage Faults. The node is in state initial start. Do as follows:
    1. Perform data collection as described in document Data Collection Guideline.
    2. Follow the instructions in document Emergency Restore Node from Backup on Site, if an appropriate backup is available on the computer, otherwise go to next step.
    3. Follow the instructions in Manage Integration. In a unit equipped with a board restore button, a board restore must be performed before following the instructions in Manage Integration: Use a pen to press down the board restore button for more than 8 seconds. Wait until the unit has been restarted and the Operational optical indicator once again is flashing slowly at 0.5 Hz, before releasing the button. Node parameters are now set to factory settings and all previously downloaded software have been removed. Figure 2 Example of Placement of the Board Restore Button on a Baseband 6620 or Baseband 6630 Unit Figure 3 Example of Placement of the Board Restore Button on a Baseband 6502 or Baseband 6303 Unit Figure 4 Example of Placement of the Board Restore Button on Streetmacro 6705 Unit
4. If the Fault optical indicator is on, one or several HW faults are detected on the unit. Go to Unit Fault Optical Indicator On.
5. If the Fault optical indicator is off, connect the computer to LMT port on the unit, see document Connect Client.
6. Start Linux shell or any Microsoft Windows SSH client. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as a User, by using command ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;userName&gt;. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The SSH-port is attribute port TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. UserName is the user name configured in the LDAP server which has one or several roles. The roles are defined in MO class LocalAuthorizationMethod TOOLTIPFLAG. If logon is successful, go to Step 9Step 7. For logging on as Maintenance User using an SSH client, go to Step 8.
7. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User, using a TLS client. For Linux shell, openssl can be used as TLS client. For example, . If it is not possible to log on to the node as a User, log on as a Maintenance User. For logging on as Maintenance User using a TLS client, execute openssl s\_client -quiet -connect &lt;ip-address&gt;:&lt;tls-port&gt; -cert client.pem -CAfile ca.pem. The IP address is the LMT port IP address. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The TLS port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliTls TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 9830. If logon is successful, go to Step 9. If it is not possible to log on as a Maintenance User using a TLS client, log on as a Maintenance User using an SSH client. For logging on as Maintenance User using an SSH client, go to Step 8. If no Maintenance User is configured, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, contact the next level of maintenance support.
8. Start Linux shell or any Microsoft Windows SSH client. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User, by using command ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;userName&gt;. The IP address is the LMT port IP address. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The SSH-port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. UserName is the Maintenance User name. If logon is successful, go to Step 9. If no Maintenance User is configured or if it is not possible to log on to the node, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, contact the next level of maintenance support.
9. Use Ericsson CLI command show --recursive ManagedElement=1, SystemFunctions=1, Fm=1 to view active alarms. Attribute managedElementId TOOLTIPFLAG is found in MO class ManagedElement TOOLTIPFLAG. Check for and act on any O&amp;M Access and Security alarms by following respective alarm Operating Instructions.
10. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verifies that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, perform data collection as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, go to Check for O&amp;M Access Configuration Fault.

# 3 Procedure

This section provides instructions for how to recover a node on

site.

## 3.1 Unit Fault Optical Indicator On

The unit is faulty when the Fault optical indicator is on. The node may not carry traffic

in this situation.

Figure 5 shows the workflow when the Fault optical

indicator is on.

Figure 5   Workflow when the Fault Optical Indicator is on.

Steps

To perform a power cycle on the node to try to correct

the fault, do the following:

1. Perform data collection as described in document Data Collection Guideline.
2. Switch off the power switch and wait 10 seconds.
3. Switch on the power again. Wait 5 minutes for the SW to load and the unit to stabilize.
4. If the Fault optical indicator is still on, replace the unit and restore the node as described in Replace Unit and Restore Node.
5. If the Fault optical indicator is off and the Operational optical indicator is on, contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verify that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, connect the computer to the LMT port on the unit, see document Connect Client. If the Fault optical indicator is off and the Operational optical indicator is off, replace the unit and restore the node as described in Replace Unit and Restore Node.
6. Start Linux shell or any Microsoft Windows SSH client. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as a User, by using command ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;userName&gt;. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The SSH-port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. UserName is the user name configured in the LDAP server which has one or several roles. The roles are defined in MO class LocalAuthorizationMethod TOOLTIPFLAG. If logon is successful, go to Step 9. If it is not possible to log on to the node as a User, log on as a Maintenance User. For logging on as Maintenance User using a TLS client, go to Step 7. For logging on as Maintenance User using an SSH client, go to Step 8.
7. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User, using a TLS client. For Linux shell, openssl can be used as TLS client. For example, openssl s\_client -quiet -connect &lt;ip-address&gt;:&lt;tls-port&gt; -cert client.pem -CAfile ca.pem. The IP address is the LMT port IP address. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The TLS port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliTls TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 9830. If logon is successful, go to Step 9. If it is not possible to log on as a Maintenance User using a TLS client, log on as a Maintenance User using an SSH client. For logging on as Maintenance User using an SSH client, go to Step 8. If no Maintenance User is configured, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, contact the next level of maintenance support.
8. Start Linux shell or any Microsoft Windows SSH client. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User, by using command ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;userName&gt;. The IP address is the LMT port IP address. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The SSH-port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. UserName is the Maintenance User name. If logon is successful, go to Step 9. If no Maintenance User is configured or if it is not possible to log on to the node, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, contact the next level of maintenance support.
9. Verify the current time and date on the node in attribute localDateTime TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class DateAndTime TOOLTIPFLAG. After power off and on, date and time are reset. Until network time is known and established, existing licenses and security certificates might be invalid.
10. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verify that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, go to Check for O&amp;M Access Configuration Fault

## 3.2 Replace Unit and Restore Node

To replace the unit and restore the node, do the following:

Steps

1. Connect the computer to the LMT port on the unit, see document Connect Client.
2. Start Linux shell or any Microsoft Windows SSH client. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as a User, by using command ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;userName&gt;. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The SSH-port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. UserName is the user name configured in the LDAP server which has one or several roles. The roles are defined in MO class LocalAuthorizationMethod TOOLTIPFLAG. If logon is successful, go to Step 5. If it is not possible to log on to the node as a User, log on as a Maintenance User. For logging on as Maintenance User using a TLS client, go to Step 3. For logging on as Maintenance User using an SSH client, go to Step 4.
3. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User, using a TLS client. For Linux shell, openssl can be used as TLS client. For example, openssl s\_client -quiet -connect &lt;ip-address&gt;:&lt;tls-port&gt; -cert client.pem -CAfile ca.pem. The IP address is the LMT port IP address. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The TLS port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliTls TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 9830. If logon is successful, go to Step 5. If it is not possible to log on as a Maintenance User using a TLS client, log on as a Maintenance User using an SSH client. For logging on as Maintenance User using an SSH client, go to Step 4. If no Maintenance User is configured, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, go to Step 7.
4. Start Linux shell or any Microsoft Windows SSH client. Log on to the node Ericsson CLI as Maintenance User, by using command ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;userName&gt;. The IP address is the LMT port IP address. The LMT port IP address is by default 169.254.2.2. The SSH-port is the port TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in MO class CliSsh TOOLTIPFLAG and is by default 2023. UserName is the Maintenance User name. If logon is successful, go to Step 5. If no Maintenance User is configured or if it is not possible to log on to the node, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline. Also, go to Step 7.
5. Perform data collection as described in document Data Collection Guideline.
6. If applicable, create a backup and export the backup to the computer, as described in document Manage Software. Creating a backup makes it easier to restore the node after replacing the unit.
7. Lock the unit by pressing the maintenance button for more than 2 seconds, but less than 7 seconds. For more information about the maintenance button, see document Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.
8. Replace the unit as described in document Replace Baseband.
9. Restore the node. If a pre-integrated replacement unit is installed, go to Step 10. For information about pre-integration, see document Manage Integration. If the installed replacement unit is not pre-integrated, do one of the following steps: If an appropriate backup is available on the computer, follow the instructions in document Emergency Restore Node from Backup on Site. If no appropriate backup is available, follow the instructions in document Manage Integration.
10. Wait until the Operational optical indicator on the unit is on.
11. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If O&amp;M communication is re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verifies that no important alarms remain to be resolved.
12. If the O&amp;M communication is not re-established, go to Check for O&amp;M Access Configuration Fault.

## 3.3 Check for O&amp;M Access Configuration Fault

Figure 6 shows the workflow on how to check for

O&amp;M access configuration fault.

Figure 6   Workflow on how to check for O&amp;M Access Configuration Fault.

To check and correct any O&amp;M access configuration faults, do the following:

Prerequisites

Make sure to consult the flowchart in Unit Fault Optical Indicator On before

starting the procedure.

Steps

1. Check if the node has rolled back to a configuration with a non-valid O&amp;M IP address or a non-valid LDAP server IP address, or both. Check the backup name of the last restored backup in attribute lastRestoredBackup TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class BrmBackupLabelStore TOOLTIPFLAG. Check attribute backupName TOOLTIPFLAG and attribute creationTime TOOLTIPFLAG for the corresponding BrmBackup TOOLTIPFLAG MO instance. If the node has rolled back to a non-valid configuration, go to Step 5.
2. Verify the O&amp;M IP address for remote O&amp;M access to the node on the Ethernet interface. Attribute accessPoint TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class OamAccessPoint TOOLTIPFLAG refers to an AddressIPv4 TOOLTIPFLAG or AddressIPv6 MO instance. The node O&amp;M IP address is shown in attribute address in the referenced AddressIPv4 TOOLTIPFLAG or AddressIPv6 MO instance. If faulty, correct the O&amp;M IP address by setting attribute address to the correct O&amp;M IP address. Prerequisite: Activate the BrmFailsafeBackup function before configuring the O&amp;M access point. This prevents a potential OAM connectivity loss. The default value for BrmFailsafeBackup 1200 seconds before rollback.
3. Verify NETCONF port configuration. Check attribute port TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class NetconfSsh TOOLTIPFLAG for NETCONF over SSH. Check attribute port TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class NetconfTls TOOLTIPFLAG for NETCONF over TLS. If faulty, correct the NETCONF port configuration by setting attribute port to the correct NETCONF port.
4. Verify the LDAP server IP address, see attribute ldapIpAddress TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class Ldap TOOLTIPFLAG. If faulty, correct the LDAP server IP address by setting attribute ldapIpAddress to the correct LDAP server IP address. Go to Step 7. Activate the BrmFailsafeBackup function before configuring LDAP. This prevents a potential OaM connectivity loss.
5. Restore the node from a backup by initiating action restore() TOOLTIPFLAG on the valid BrmBackup TOOLTIPFLAG MO instance.
6. Track the progress of the restore() action by attribute progressReport TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class BrmBackup TOOLTIPFLAG. The action is finished when the progressReport TOOLTIPFLAG state is FINISHED, and the action is successful when the progressReport TOOLTIPFLAG result is SUCCESS. If the progressReport TOOLTIPFLAG result is FAILURE, read the progressReport TOOLTIPFLAG resultInfo . If the restore action fails, the node returns to the same consistent state present before the restore action was initiated. Perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline and contact the next level of maintenance support.
7. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If O&amp;M communication is re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verifies that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, go to Check Cables and Connections.

## 3.4 Check Cables and Connections

To check cables and connectors, do the following:

Steps

1. Check the cables connected to the unit for faults. If the cabling or the cables are faulty, reconnect or replace the cables. If the cabling and connections are correct, go to Restart Node.
2. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verifies that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, go to Restart Node.

## 3.5 Restart Node

Restart the node to ensure that there are no communication faults in the node.

Prerequisites

- The indicator LED is not lit. Note: If the indicator LED is lit, the unit has to be replaced. See Replace Unit and Restore Node

Steps

1. Check if the faulty unit is a Baseband unit.
    - If the faulty unit is a Baseband or Streetmacro unit, go to Step 2
    - If the faulty unit is not a Baseband unit, go to Step 3
2. Restart the unit with restartRank RESTART\_COLDWTEST if the faulty unit is a Baseband unit. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment, Restart Unit. RestartRank RESTART\_COLDWTEST is only available on Streetmacro 6705. Restart the node by using Ericsson CLI command ManagedElement=&lt;managedElementId&gt;,Equipment=1,FieldReplaceableUnit=&lt;fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt;,restartUnit --restartRank RESTART\_COLDWTEST. Use the ManagedElement.managedElementId attribute. During restart rank cold with test all optical indicators are off.
    1. If it was possible to restart the node by using Ericsson CLI command and the unit is not faulty according the test, go to Step 5.
    2. If it was possible to restart the node by using Ericsson CLI command and the unit is faulty according the test, replace the unit.
    3. If it was not possible to restart the node by using Ericsson CLI command, go to Step 3.
3. Restart the node by switching off the power to the unit using the circuit breaker on the Power Distribution Unit (PDU). Wait 10 seconds and switch on the circuit breaker. Wait 5 minutes for the SW to load and the unit to stabilize.
4. Verify the current time and date on the node in the DateAndTime.localDateTime attribute. After power off, the date and time are reset. Until network time is known and established, existing licenses and security certificates are invalid.
5. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verifies that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, go to Verify Software Versions.
6. If the node is not recovered, contact the next level of support.

## 3.6 Verify Software Versions

Attribute

active

in MO class

SwInventory

shows the SW version currently running on the node. The

active SW version control the behavior of the ME.

To verify SW versions, do the following:

Steps

1. Verify that the correct UP is running on the node by viewing attribute active TOOLTIPFLAG in MO class SwInventory TOOLTIPFLAG.
2. Verify the content of the UP by viewing the corresponding MO of class SwVersion TOOLTIPFLAG.
3. Verify the content of a Load Module Container (LMC) by viewing the corresponding MO of class SwItem TOOLTIPFLAG. An LMC contains a number of executable SW products. The attribute consistsOf TOOLTIPFLAG describes any hierarchical relationship between SW items.
4. If the UP is correct, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline and contact the next level of maintenance support.
5. If the UP is incorrect, perform an upgrade or restore node from backup as described in document Manage Software.
6. Contact the OMC to verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If re-established, OMC continues the analysis and verifies that no important alarms remain to be resolved. If normal O&amp;M communication is not re-established, perform data collection by the EA as described in document Data Collection Guideline and contact the next level of maintenance support.
