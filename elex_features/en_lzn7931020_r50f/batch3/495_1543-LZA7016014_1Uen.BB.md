# 2 Remedy Action for RiLink

This alarm is raised when a working link is considered having a high bit error rate

and requires preventive actions to be taken. Link is restarted (cell not affected)

at first occurrence and if high BER is recurring, the alarm is raised. To rule-out

other possible reasons for error, the link restart is performed only once.

The BER degradation is not supervised on eCPRI connections. Therefore, this alarm is

not supported for eCPRI connections.

As BER detection is not available on layer 1 for CPRI line rate 10.1 Gbps and above,

the alarm is not reported on the following RAN Compute units for line rate 10.1 Gbps

and above:

- Baseband 6648
- Baseband 6641
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347

Before starting to implement the remedy actions, it is important to note the

following:

- Wait 90 seconds after each section, when there is no other required waiting time stated.
- After each of the steps ranging from step 1 to step 9, check if alarm has ceased. If it has, the flow should be terminated.
- When a remedy action solves the problem in a cascaded configuration, other alarms can be raised but cease in 60 seconds.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check if other alarms are present. Resolve synchronization and clock alarms first.
3. Check that the correct SFP is mounted in both ends of the link: For more information about SFP, see SFP Module Selector Guide.
    1. Fiber length
    2. Maximum and minimum operating temperature
    3. Check in SFP Module Selector Guide that the two SFPs are matching. If not, change at least one of them.
4. Restart the unit at the far end of the link and wait for 5 minutes. Note: Check the MSMM configuration in Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.
5. Restart the unit at the near end of the link and wait 5 minutes after the unit has restarted. Note: All steps up to this point, including step 4, can be done remotely, except for the SFP change in step 2.
6. Check the easiest accessible SFP. If the connector looks dirty or damaged, clean or change it.
7. Change the easiest accessible SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.
8. Check whether the cable is damaged.
9. Check the second SFP on the other side of the link. If the connector looks dirty or damaged, clean or change it.
10. Change the second SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.
11. Change the far end unit. And wait 5 minutes after the unit has restarted. If problems remain, change it back.
12. Change the near end unit. And wait 5 minutes after the unit has restarted. If problems remain, change it back.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

13. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for RiLink: RiLink established at &lt;value&gt; Mbps while the highest link rate supported by the equipment is &lt;value&gt; Mbps.

This alarm is raised on the RiLink MO to identify use cases where

Ethernet link rate is activated after the link is established or reestablished

resulting in a lower line rate than the highest common line rate that could be

reached. The raised Link Degraded alarm indicates the

link line rate as non-optimal.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

2. If other unresolved alarms are present, resolve the alarms.
3. Check whether the correct SFP is mounted on both ends of the link based on the following criteria: For more information about SFP, see SFP Module Selector Guide.
    1. Check fiber length.
    2. Check maximum and minimum operating temperature.
    3. Ensure that the two SFPs match. If not, change at least one of them.
4. Run Health Check rules from RiLink Status and Quality. Note: This step can be done remotely. For more information on RiLink Status and Quality Health Check rules, see Node Health Check Description in Manage Node Health Check.
5. Restart the unit at the far end of the link.
6. Wait for 5 minutes. Note: For more information on MSMM configuration, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.
7. Restart the unit at the near end of the link.
8. Wait 5 minutes after the unit restarts. Note: All steps up to this point, including Step 6, can be done remotely, except for the SFP change in Step 3.
9. Ensure that the SFP connector is clean and undamaged.
10. Change the most easily accessible SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.
11. Verify that the cable is not damaged.
12. Change the most easily accessible SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.
13. Change the second SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.
14. Change the far end unit.
15. Wait 5 minutes after the unit restarts. If the problems remain, change it back.
16. Change the near end unit.
17. Wait 5 minutes after the unit restarts. If the problems remain, change it back.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

18. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
