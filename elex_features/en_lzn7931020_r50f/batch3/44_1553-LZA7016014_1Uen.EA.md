## 1.1 Radio Network Overview

The LTE radio network consists of the functions and interfaces

between User Equipment (UE) and the eNodeB (eNB). This document provides

an overview of the network and the concepts that apply, with instructions

for intial configurations and general guidelines. Detailed concepts

and configurations are described in separate documents. LTE services

and bearers are described in Manage Bearers and Services. Mobility-related

configurations and UE measurements are described in Manage Mobility, and Automated Neighbor Relations (ANR) in Manage Automated Neighbor Relations.

## 1.2 Concepts

### 1.2.1 EUTRAN Cells

A cell is a geographical area with its own carrier frequency and channels within the sector

frequency band. Several cells can share the same sector equipment. A cell may contain one or

more sector carriers.

Each cell is represented by an

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

MO class, depending on whether it represents a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) or a Time Division Duplex (TDD) frame structure.

In this document, cell MO implies the MO class representing the applicable

cell(s).

The generic MO operations to use are create, delete,

and setAttribute.

The following settings are defined for each cell, by default:

- Configured to operate with two transmit and two receive antennas
- Sub-carrier spacing of 15 kHz
- Cyclic prefix type Normal
- FDD (type 1) or TDD (type 2) frame structure

A cell must be associated with a previously created

SectorCarrier

MO and a previously created

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO before the

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

MO can be created.

The cell bandwidth is symmetrical in downlink and uplink. The physical bandwidth is

controlled by a license key and the radio hardware capabilities. For more information about

frequency bands and bandwidths, see Radio Capabilities.

#### 1.2.1.1 No DL TX Power Detector

No DL TX Power Detector allows the detection of suspected sleeping cells based on the

radio carrier power levels.

The detection mechanism triggers in the order of minutes. Cell re-setup is automatically

triggered as a recovery mechanism. In case of recovery failure, an alarm is raised.

No DL TX Power Detector is active by default.

Figure 1   Enhancement No DL TX Power Overview

The following steps are performed by sleeping cell detection using DL TX power

monitoring:

1. No DL TX Power indicating a sleeping cell is detected on the radio unit.
2. The radio unit notifies the controller on the Baseband Node.
3. The controller triggers a cell re-setup as recovery action.
4. If the recovery action is failed, an alarm is raised.

No DL TX Power Detection Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 2   No DL TX Power Detector Flowchart

The feature operates the following way:

1. If No DL TX Power event is detected on any carrier branch, it triggers cell re-setup.
2. Any other subsequent detections on other carrier branches is ignored while the recovery is ongoing.
3. The cell lock clears all alarms, including Downlink TX No Power Detected alarm.
4. If the recovery action was not successful, a Downlink TX No Power Detected alarm is raised on the EUtracCellFDD or the EUTrancellTDD MO.

Hardware

No DL TX Power Detection is applicable to the radios that support VSWR

measurements.

### 1.2.2 Cell Configuration Conditions

Table 1 describes configuration of

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

MO attributes under several conditions:

Table 1   Conditions for Reconfiguring Cells

| Condition                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cell Temporarily Disabled                    | Configuring attributes requires the cell to be temporarily disabled during the configuration. The attributes are marked with Disturbances: Changes may affect traffic in the MOM.  Note that the cell is locked during the configuration and that traffic through the cell is not possible until the cell is unlocked.  The cell is automatically locked when the configuration starts. It is unlocked when the attributes have been changed and the new attribute values are used. |
| Cell Locked                                  | Since the cell is locked and no traffic exists in the cell, it may be configured. The cell remains locked after configuration and must be manually unlocked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Cell Enabled due to Fewer Required Resources | The new configuration requires fewer cell resources than are available. The cell can be enabled with the available resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Disabled Cell                                | The cell is disabled both before and after configuration. The cell is successfully taken down but does not become enabled. An alarm is triggered indicating that the cell is still disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### 1.2.3 Sector

A sector is comprised of one or more cells in a specific frequency

band, and provides coverage to a geographic area.

The configuration of each sector is stored in the

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO. The frequency band covered by the sector is controlled

by the capability of the radio unit connected to the same MO. The

frequency band may be obtained from the read-only attribute

fqBand

.

### 1.2.4 Sector Carrier

A sector carrier is part of a defined cell. The

SectorCarrier

MO class is a sub class to the cell MO.

The

SectorCarrier

MO represents the use of the resources that are referred

to by the

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO.

An EUTRAN cell can refer to one or, with the Combined Cell feature

activated, several instances of the

SectorCarrier

MO class.

### 1.2.5 External Network

The eNodeBs can be configured for external cells and coexisting EUTRANs, GUTRANs, UTRANs,

GERANs, CDMA2000 eHRPD, and CDMA2000 1xRTT networks. ENodeBs configured with information about

surrounding cells in other base stations is a prerequisite for UE mobility involving those

cells.

Automated Neighbor Relations (ANR) is a feature automating most

of this configuration. MOs representing frequencies and frequency

relations must be created by the operator. Those MOs are prerequisites

for ANR.

### 1.2.6 Radio Access

This section describes functions related to the physical layer

(layer 1) of the LTE air interface Uu.

The functions provided by the physical layer include:

- Transport channel errors detection and reporting to higher layers
- Forward Error Correction (FEC) for encoding and decoding the transport channel
- FEC for encoding and decoding the transport channel using HARQ soft-combining
- Rate matching the coded transport channel to physical channels
- Mapping the coded transport channel onto physical channels
- Physical channel power weighting
- Physical channel modulation and demodulation
- Frequency and time synchronization
- Radio characteristics measurements and indication to higher layers
- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna processing
- Transmit (TX) diversity

### 1.2.7 System Information

System information distribution is a basic and essential function

of LTE RAN. UE requires system information to:

- Perform idle mode tasks, for example: Cell selection and reselection Adhere to cell reservations and access restrictions
- Originate access to the network
- Terminate access including reception of paging messages
- Maintain LTE connection
- Perform handover
- Access eMBMS services

System Information consists of a MasterInformationBlock (MIB) and

a number of SystemInformationBlocks (SIB).

The MIB defines essential physical layer information about the

cell, required by the UE before receiving further system information.

The MIB is transmitted on the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH).

SIBs are broadcast on the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)

at regular intervals. SIB1 is carried in its own dedicated RRC message,

all other SIBs are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages. The

SI messages may be configured, see Configure System Information Messages.

For more information on individual SIB functions, see Evolved Universal Terrestrial

Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN);

Overall description; Stage 2 and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access

(E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification.

# 2 Procedures

## 2.1 Configuration Flow

The configuration flow consists of creating the following files:

- A configuration template file that can be reused for multiple nodes
- A site-specific configuration file, which is created by populating the template file with site-specific parameters

Template files can be created in one of the following ways:

- Using the Configuration Generator for automatic template creation with the ECT or a plug-in in the Auto Provisioning application of the ENM.
- Creating new XML NETCONF files.

The preferred procedure is to use the Configuration Generator. Only edit the template file

with an XML editor if the required configuration is not supported by the tool.

When the preferred configuration procedure is used, it is not necessary to understand the MO

structure. However, for maintenance and troubleshooting, the MO structure must be

understood.

For more information on configuration methods, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool. For more information on

configuration files, see Manage Configuration Files.

### 2.1.1 Radio Network Configuration File

Radio access configurations are specified in a configuration file that can be in a

Netconf or Bulk CM format. When using the Netconf format, the ECT can be used to validate the file, and

generate a template file based on the configuration.

### 2.1.2 Radio Network Configuration with the Basic Configuration Method

When creating template files with the basic configuration method, the ECT generates the

required MO structure based on GUI input parameters.

Figure 3   MO Structure of Radio Network Settings

The ECT generates an MO structure with the following elements:

- For each frequency in the GUI, one EUtranFrequency MO instance is created.
- For each cell in the GUI, one EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO instance is created.
- For each cell in the GUI, one EUtranFreqRelation MO instance is created, which represents the frequency used by the cell. Also, for each frequency relation that is defined in the GUI, one EUtranFreqRelation MO instance is created. This indicates frequency relations to other frequencies on which neighbors can be measured by UEs while being in the cell (in idle or connected mode).Note: It is not recommended to keep relations to frequencies that do not exist, so the corresponding EUtranFrequency and the EUtranFreqRelation MO instances must be removed. If this recommendation is not followed, the following negative impacts can be observed on the network: Increased UE battery drain Significant downlink throughput decrease Increased handover time and possibility of dropped UEs
- For each carrier in the GUI, one SectorCarrier MO instance is created.

Table 2   Radio Network Instance Names

| MO Class           | Instance Name                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ENodeBFunction     | 1                                        |
| SctpProfile        | LTE                                      |
| SctpEndpoint       | LTE                                      |
| TermPointToMme     | MME_Identity:<no> parameter in GUI  (1)  |
| EUtranFrequency    | Frequency_identity parameter in GUI      |
| EUtranCellFDD      | Cell_identity parameter in GUI           |
| EUtranCellTDD      | Cell_identity parameter in GUI           |
| EUtranFreqRelation | Frequency_relation parameter in GUI  (2) |
| SectorCarrier      | Carrier_identity parameter in GUI  (3)   |

(1)

This is a substitution parameter, where &lt;no&gt; indicates the

number of MME nodes.

(2)

This is identical to the Frequency\_identity of the selected

frequency.

(3)

This is an optional parameter. If the parameter is not set, the

name of the SectorCarrier instance is

&lt;Cell identity&gt; S: &lt;Sector identity&gt;.

## 2.2 Configure LTE Overview

4. Unlock the TermPointToGNB MO. Result: The system automatically creates and configures the ExternalGUtranCell MO instance that represents the NR cell on the NR Node.

## 2.4 Manage Cells

### 2.4.1 Add Cell

In order to create a cell, the referenced SectorCarrier MO and the

referenced SectorEquipmentFunction MO must have been created

previously.

If the Baseband unit runs in power saving mode, adding and unlocking new cells can require

node restart. Power saving status can be checked on the

PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute. For more information on

power saving mode, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

If there is a cell in a sector with an AAS, the following

configuration is required:

- Attribute SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef has to reference a Transceiver MO that represents antenna streams in an AIR.
- Attribute SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas must be set to 0.
- Attribute SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas must be set to 0.

To add a cell, do the following:

Steps

1. Create the cell MO (EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD). When the cell is added, parameter configurations are saved persistently by the node.
2. After the cell is added, the cell MO exists and has administrative state set to locked, operational state is set to disabled, and availability status is set to offline. The cell parameters are stored persistently in the MOM.

After This Task

If the Baseband node runs in power saving mode, the added and unlocked cell can exceed the

limits of capacity that the power saving mode can support. If this happens, the

Power saving Capacity Limit Exceeded alarm is raised. To

cease the alarm and enable more cells, node restart is needed. For more information, see

Power Saving Capacity Limit Exceeded .

### 2.4.2 Lock Cell

To lock a cell, do the following:

Steps

1. When the cell administrative state is set to locked, transmission and reception of mandatory common channels are turned off and all UE contexts residing in the cell are discarded.
2. It is possible to move the traffic to another cell before the cell is locked. This feature is described in Cell Soft Lock. Note: To make the locked cell resources available for a new cell, either restart the node used by the locked cell, or delete one of the existing cells before creating a new cell.

### 2.4.3 Unlock Cell

To unlock a cell, do the following:

Steps

1. When the administrative state of the cell is set to unlocked, the RBS allocates resources for the cell. All created cells are considered for resource handling. Once resources are allocated, the RBS starts transmission of mandatory common channels on the Uu interface. Note: Unlocking cells in a remote radio unit can take longer than normal.

### 2.4.4 Delete Cell

When a cell MO is deleted, the cell parameters are deleted from

the RBS.

To delete a Cell, do the following:

Steps

1. Set the administrative state of the cell MO to locked.
2. When the cell is deleted from the RBS, the cell MO is removed. Note: If the cell MO administrative state is set to unlocked, and an attempt is made to delete it, the deletion is rejected because deletion of unlocked MOs is prohibited. It is quite common that deleting cells is preceded by deleting relations and in such case it is recommended to set temporarily the attribute x2SetupTwoWayRelations to false. This will decrease signaling on X2 interfaces and prevent recreation of already deleted relations. When last cell is deleted all S1 and X2 links are disabled immediately, so in some cases updates may not reach neighbors. Then it might be necessary to perform manual actions in neighbors and remove obsolete relations or wait until ANR removes them.

### 2.4.5 Configure FDD Cell Bandwidth and Radio Channels

Stop!

Inappropriate settings can

cause significant problems. Changes to the attributes described in this section can affect

traffic.

Some bandwidth-related attribute values require licenses, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.

For more information about frequency bands and bandwidths, see Radio Node Configurations.

The following attributes identify bandwidth and channel numbers for the cell:

- EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl: specifies the channel number for the central downlink frequency. The mapping from channel number to physical frequency is defined in 3GPP specification TS 36.104.
- EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth: downlink channel bandwidth in the cell. The supported channel bandwidth per frequency band is described in 3GPP specification TS 36.101.
- EUtranCellFDD.earfcnul: specifies the channel number for the central uplink frequency. The mapping from channel number to physical frequency is defined in 3GPP specification TS 36.104.
- EUtranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth: uplink channel bandwidth in the cell.

### 2.4.6 Configure TDD Cell Bandwidth and Radio Channels

Stop!

Inappropriate settings can

cause significant problems. Changes to the attributes described in this section can affect

traffic.

Some bandwidth-related attribute values require licenses, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.

For more information about frequency bands and bandwidths, see Radio Node Configurations.

The following attributes identify bandwidth and channel numbers for the cell:

- earfcn TOOLTIPFLAG: specifies the channel number for the central frequency. The mapping from channel number to physical frequency is defined in 3GPP specification TS 36.104.
- channelBandwidth TOOLTIPFLAG: channel bandwidth in the cell. The supported channel bandwidth per frequency band is described in 3GPP specification TS 36.101.

### 2.4.7 Configure Maximum RF Output Power

The following attributes in the cell MOs affect maximum RF output power:

- pMaxServingCell: Pmax to be used in the cell. If not found, the UE applies the maximum power according to the UE capability. If the High Power UE feature is used, the following applies: To enable high power UEs on a cell on frequency band 14 or 41, the MOM attribute EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell or EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell must be set to a value higher than 23, representing the output power 23 dBm.
- pZeroNominalPucch: Nominal component of the UE transmit power for PUCCH.
- pZeroNominalPusch: Nominal component of the UE transmit power for PUSCH.
- alpha: Pathloss compensation factor for power control of the PUSCH.

### 2.4.8 Configure Maximum Cell Range

The maximum cell range depends on deployment and subframe pattern.

Prerequisites

The Maximum Cell Range feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.cellRange or EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute.

To set the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 15:

2. Set the EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment to 1.
3. Set the EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern attribute to one of the following values:
    - 7 allows cell ranges 1-18. This setting provides the best downlink throughput. If using this value, setting the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 18 is rejected because of inconsistency between the specialSubframePattern and cellRange attributes.
    - 6 allows cell ranges 1-29. This setting provides a slightly reduced downlink throughput. If using this value, setting the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 29 is rejected because of inconsistency between the specialSubframePattern and cellRange attributes.
    - 5 allows cell ranges 1-93. This setting provides a significantly reduced downlink throughput. If using this value, setting the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 93 is rejected because of inconsistency between the specialSubframePattern and cellRange attributes.

Related Information

Maximum Cell Range

### 2.4.9 Read Cell Availability

The following attributes in the cell MO classes provide information

about availability:

- acBarringInfo: Contains all access barring information.
- administrativeState: The administrative status of the cell.
- availabilityStatus: The availability status of the cell. It contains details about the operationalState attribute, which is set by the software in the RBS.
- cellBarred: Specifies if the cell is required for a specific purpose and not accessible to random user equipment.
- primaryPlmnReserved: Indicates if the primary PLMN ID in the cell is reserved for operator use. The primary PLMN ID is reserved if this attribute is set to true. Note: If the Shared LTE RAN feature is activated and the EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attributes are defined, the value of the primary PLMN ID equals the cell-level primary PLMN ID. Otherwise, the value of the primary PLMN ID equals the node-level primary PLMN ID, which is defined in the ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId attribute.
- operationalState: The operational state. This attribute is set by the software in the RBS.

### 2.4.10 Retrieve Dynamic Cell Status

It is possible to retrieve a snapshot of attached UEs and set up

radio bearers per cell, enabling to see if the RBS node is accepting

traffic. This is useful when returning an RBS to operational mode

after maintenance work, after an upgrade has been performed, when

a new feature has been activated, and for troubleshooting purposes.

The operator can request Dynamic Cell Status in the following ways:

- Remotely From the OSS via Common Explorer (Network Configuration and Network Status perspectives) where Dynamic Cell Status is available in a menu. From EMCLI, where Dynamic Cell Status is requested via the ENodeBFunction.collectDynamicCellStatus MO action. More information can be found in EMCLI Launcher.
- On-site From EMCLI or COM CLI via a client connected locally to the RBS. Dynamic Cell Status is requested via the ENodeBFunction.collectDynamicCellStatus MO action.

All TDD cells with the same frequency band, or specific frequency                                     band combinations where one frequency band overlaps with                                     another, for example band 38 and band 41, must have the same                                     frame start offset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern | The special subframe pattern configuration for Downlink Part of                                     Time Slot (DwPTS), Guard Period (GP), and Uplink Part of Time                                     Slot (UpPTS).   All TDD cells in the same frequency band, or specific frequency                                     band combinations where one frequency overlaps with another, for                                     example, band 38 and band 41, must have the same                                         EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern                                     configuration.        |
| EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment     | The assignment of uplink and downlink subframes for the TDD frame                                     structure (called UL/DL configuration in 3GPP TS 36.211).   All TDD cells in the same Baseband unit must have the same uplink                                     and downlink subframe assignment.

To achieve best performance and maximum utilization of resources, it is recommended

to configure same values for the attributes

EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset or

EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern, or both, for all cells

on one Baseband unit.

In case of unsupported TDD configurations, the affected cells are disabled, and the

alarms Inconsistent Configuration or Resource Allocation Failure, or both, are

raised. For handling these alarms, see Inconsistent Configuration and Resource Allocation Failure.

Steps

- Configure the attribute EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset.
- Configure attribute EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern. Note: The attribute EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern cannot have the value 5 if the value of the attribute Paging.nB is T4. More information can be found in Manage Bearers and Services, and in 3GPP TS 36.213.
- Configure the attribute EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment.

### 2.4.13 Set NR Coverage within the FDD EUTRAN Cell for Configuration-Based EN-DC Setup

In EN-DC, the EUtranCellFDD.extGUtranCellRef attribute must be set

on the Master Node if the following conditions apply:

- NR coverage is provided within an FDD EUTRAN cell.
- Configuration-based EN-DC setup is preferred.

Prerequisites

NR coverage is provided within an FDD EUTRAN cell and configuration-based EN-DC setup

is preferred.

Steps

- Set the EUtranCellFDD.extGUtranCellRef attribute to reference a specific NR cell instance defined in the ExternalGUtranCell MO.

Results

Results

The ExternalGUtranCell MO contains information about an NR cell

overlapping a TDD EUTRAN cell and configuration based EN-DC setup can be used.

### 2.4.15 Configure Downlink Multi-User MIMO Layers

To enable the Multi-User MIMO Downlink Layers Extension feature, the

MultiUserMIMODownlink license must be available for the

operator.

Steps

1. Activate the corresponding feature state by defining the maximum number of layers for Multi-User MIMO for every cell in the eNodeB with the following attributes: Note: For the Multi-User MIMO Downlink feature, a maximum of 16 layers is supported on LTE 15 MHz and on LTE 20 MHz, and a maximum of 10 layers is supported on LTE 10 MHz. Setting the EUtranCellTDD.dlMaxMuMimoLayers attribute to 0 prevents Multi-User MIMO from being used on that cell for downlink.
    - Set the EUtranCellTDD.ulSrsEnable attribute to enabled.
    - EUtranCellTDD.dlMaxMuMimoLayers for the Multi-User MIMO Downlink feature.

Results

The total number of assigned layers in the cells of the node must not be higher than

the contracted capacity of the node. The value range of the capacity license is the

total number of contracted multi-user MIMO layers in the node.

### 2.4.16 Configure Downlink Beamforming for Massive MIMO

Steps

1. To enable SRS, set the EUtranCellTDD.ulSrsEnable attribute to true.

### 2.4.17 Configure Automatic Transmission Mode Switching for Massive MIMO

In Massive MIMO TDD, automatic switching is available between TM3-TM7 and

TM3-TM8.

In Massive MIMO FDD, automatic switching is available between TM4-TM9.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellTDD.tm7ModeSwitchingEnabled parameter to true to enable TM7 mode switching.
2. Set the EUtranCellTDD.tm8ModeSwitchingEnabled parameter to true to enable TM8 mode switching.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.tm9Tm4ModeSwitchingEnabled parameter to true to enable TM9 mode switching.

### 2.4.18 Configure Soft Reduction of TX Power of Cell

Prerequisites

The license for Soft Reduction of Cell Tx Power is

installed, and the feature is active.

Do not change the value of the attribute

EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio when

EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerState is CHANGING.

Steps

1. To reduce the cell TX power from the initially configured value, set the value of the attribute EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio below 100 %. Note: Changing the EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio attribute can result in loss of traffic.

### 2.4.19 View Active Local Measurements

Steps

1. View the EUtranCellFDD.activeMtdMeasurements or EUtranCellTDD.activeMtdMeasurements attribute for an array of all active Local Measurements. Up to 10 measurements can be active.

### 2.4.20 Select Different Coverage and Throughput Modes for Cell Traffic Profile

The configuration of the cell coverage and throughput mode enables the efficient use

of its capacity.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the cell mode using the SectorCarrier.radioTransmitPerfMode parameter.
3. Unlock the cell.

### 2.4.21 Configure Flexible Duplex Spacing in Frequency Band 8 for Radio 2212

The FDD cell can be configured with 39 MHz duplex spacing, in addition to the default

spacing of 45 MHz in frequency band 8 for Radio 2212.

To enable configuration of FDD cell with 39 MHz duplex spacing, the enhanced logic

for verifying the non-default duplex spacing is required. The MOM switch allowing

this enhanced logic must be turned on.

Steps

1. Set the UeMeasControl.zzzTemporary6 attribute to true. Result: The uplink EARFCN can be configured to a value that is 39 MHz apart from the downlink EARFCN value.
2. Use the changeFrequency command to set the EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl attribute to the correct value.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.earfcnul attribute to the correct value. The uplink EARFCN values must be calculated based on the selected downlink EARFCN values, and in accordance with the rules set in 3GPP TS 36.104.

Results

Flexible duplex spacing is activated. 39 MHz duplex spacing is allowed as an

additional option to the default 45 MHz spacing on frequency band 8.

## 2.5 Manage Sectors

### 2.5.1 Add Sector

To add Sectors, do the following:

Steps

1. The SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO is created and associated with one or several AntennaUnitGroup TOOLTIPFLAG MOs created previously.
2. Creating the sector triggers the RBS to store all the sector parameters persistently.
3. When the SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO administrative state is set to unlocked, the RBS allocates and configures all hardware connected to the sector, and it is associated with one or several RfBranch TOOLTIPFLAG MOs. The parameter settings are stored persistently in the RBS.
4. The RBS performs uplink and downlink gain calibration of the antenna branches. After the sector is added, a SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO exists with administrative state is set to locked, operational state is set to disabled, availability status is set to offline.

### 2.5.2 Delete Sector

To delete a Sector, do the following:

Steps

1. When deleting a SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO, it should not be associated with any sector carriers.
2. When deleting a sector, all references and the SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO are deleted from the RBS.
3. When a sector is unlocked or has a sector carrier associated with it, the request to delete the sector is rejected by the RBS.

### 2.5.3 Lock Sector

To lock a Sector, do the following:

Steps

1. When changing the SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO to administrative state set to locked, all hardware connected to the sector is released, and the sector cannot handle any cells. All connected cells become automatically disabled with availability status is set to dependency\_locked.

### 2.5.4 Unlock Sectors

To unlock a Sector, do the following:

Steps

1. When the SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO is unlocked, the RBS calibrates uplink and downlink gain of the antenna branches. Note: If the antenna branches that are associated with the sector are not fully functional within 5 minutes, the sector is enabled with its actual state.
2. If the sector has dependency-locked cells associated with it, the cells are enabled when the sector is enabled. Note: Unlocking the SectorEquipmentFunction MO can take longer than normal if the associated radio unit restarts during the deactivation of the Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature.

### 2.5.5 Connect Sector to Antenna System

Steps

1. Connect a sector to the antenna system by setting up references between the SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO and the RfBranch TOOLTIPFLAG, or branches, that are used. Note: The SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG must be LOCKED when adding RfBranch TOOLTIPFLAG MOs.

### 2.5.6 Configure SectorEquipmentFunction Attributes

When attributes are configured, the sector must be manually locked and unlocked for the new

value to take effect. The following are SectorEquipmentFunction attributes:

- administrativeState The administrative state of the sector.
- availabilityStatus The availability status of the sector. It contains details about operationalState TOOLTIPFLAG. This attribute is set by the software in the RBS.
- eUTRANFqBands The list of LTE frequency bands supported by the hardware associated with the SectorEquipmentFunction MO. If one frequency band is only partially supported by some associated RF branches, the supporting for this band would be explicitly displayed for each RF branch. Valid frequency band values are specified in 3GPP TS 36.104, subclause 5.7.3 . Full support on one RF branch means the whole 3GPP defined band is fully covered the RF branch working frequency ranges. Partial support on one RF branch means some part of the 3GPP defined band is covered by the RF branch working frequency ranges, but other parts are not. In downlink direction, one RF branch working frequency ranges are the same as its associated RF port frequency ranges. In uplink direction, one RF branch working frequency ranges are the intersection of its associated RF port frequency ranges and the optionally associated Frequency Shifting TMA (TMF) frequency range. The RF port frequency ranges is referring to attribute dlFrequencyRanges TOOLTIPFLAG and ulFrequencyRanges on RfPort MO, the supported frequency ranges depends on radio unit capability, that can be displayed in multiple frequency ranges, with lowest range at the beginning (699000 kHz-716000 kHz and 815000 kHz-830000 kHz) or single frequency range (704000 kHz-716000 kHz). Note: For hardware not supporting E-UTRA frequency bands, the list is empty.
- geranFqBands List of GERAN frequency bands that is supported by hardware associated with SectorEquipmentFunction. If a frequency band is only partially supported by some associated rfBranches, support for this band is explicitly displayed for each RfBranch. Note: For hardware not supporting GERAN frequency bands, the list is empty.
- uTRANFDDFqBands The list of UTRAN FDD frequency bands supported by the hardware associated with the SectorEquipmentFunction MO. If one frequency band is only partially supported by some associated RF branches, the supporting for this band would be explicitly displayed for each RF branch. Valid frequency band values are specified in 3GPP TS 25.104, sub-clause 5.2 . Full support on one RF branch means the whole 3GPP defined band is fully covered the RF branch working frequency ranges. Partial support on one RF branch means some part of the 3GPP defined band is covered by the RF branch working frequency ranges, but other parts are not. In downlink direction, one RF branch working frequency ranges are the same as its associated RF port frequency ranges. In uplink direction, one RF branch working frequency ranges are the intersection of its associated RF port frequency ranges and the optionally associated TMF frequency range. The RF port frequency ranges is referring to attribute dlFrequencyRanges TOOLTIPFLAG and ulFrequencyRanges on RfPort MO, the supported frequency ranges depends on radio unit capability, that can be displayed in multiple frequency ranges, with lowest range at the beginning (699000 kHz-716000 kHz and 815000 kHz-830000 kHz) or single frequency range (704000 kHz-716000 kHz). Note: For hardware not supporting UTRAN FDD frequency bands, the list is empty.
- operationalState The operational state. This attribute is set by the software in the RBS.
- reservedBy Contains a list of SectorCarrier TOOLTIPFLAGor EUtranCellFDD MO instances that reserve this MO instance. Maximum four SectorCarrier can reserve the same SectorEquipmentFunction.
- rfBranchRef Reference to the RfBranch MO instances being reserved.
- SectorEquipmentFunctionId The ID of the sector containing the value component of the RDN. It must be unique in the network.
- userLabel Label for free text.
- availableHwOutputPower:Sum of the HW power capability for all radio hardware in the sector. Note: Set the sum of configuredMaxTxPower in the sector equal to or less than availableHwOutputPower.

## 2.6 Manage Sector Carriers

### 2.6.1 Add Sector Carrier

To add a Sector Carrier, do the following:

Steps

1. To add a sector carrier, the referenced SectorEquipmentFunction TOOLTIPFLAG MO must exist.
2. Create the SectorCarrier TOOLTIPFLAG MO. When the sector carrier is added, all the sector carrier attributes are saved in the RBS.
3. After the sector carrier is added, the SectorCarrier TOOLTIPFLAG MO exists with operationalState TOOLTIPFLAG set to DISABLED and the availabilityStatus TOOLTIPFLAG set to OFFLINE.

### 2.6.2 Delete Sector Carrier

To delete a Sector Carrier, do the following:

Steps

1. When deleting a SectorCarrier TOOLTIPFLAG MO, the sector carrier must not be associated with any cell. When a sector carrier has a cell associated with it, the request to delete the sector carrier is rejected by the RBS.
2. When deleting a sector carrier, all references and the SectorCarrier TOOLTIPFLAG MO are deleted from the RBS.

### 2.6.3 Configure Sector Carrier

To configure the SectorCarrier to use Massive MIMO,

SectorCarrier.sectorFunctionRef has to refer to a

SectorEquipmentFunction MO that is configured to use a Massive

MIMO capable AAS.

Maximum Output Power

The maximum output power is configured by the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute.

If the total power used per antenna connector of a sector equipment is more than the

total power available when the cell using the SectorCarrier MO is

unlocked, an alarm is raised.

If at least

90% of configured power is allocated, then it is considered fully functional and

there should be no

alarm.

In radio units shared by multiple radio access technologies

competing for the same radio resources, the available output power is allocated to

each unlocked sector carrier, TRX, or extension TRX in a first come first served

principle until all available output power is used.

Antenna Configurations

Some antenna configurations require licenses, for more information, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.

The following attributes provide information on the antenna configuration of the

sector carrier:

- SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas To configure the sector carrier to use Massive MIMO, the SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attribute must be set to 0, and the optional feature license must be set to ENABLED. In this case, the SectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef attribute is ignored and no rejection or alarm is raised. Note: An optional feature license for multiple antennas applies to all SectorCarrier MO instances in the node. It is recommended to set the SectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef attribute to the requested number of RX antennas to avoid problems when having a SectorCarrier MO instance with different number of RX antennas. Note: If a sector carrier is configured with only one RX, the value of the SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attribute must be set to 1. Otherwise, the default value 0 raises the Service Degraded alarm.
- SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas If not all TX antennas in the sector are used, the configured number of antennas get all the output power provided by the sector depending on their output power capacity. To configure the sector carrier to use Massive MIMO, the SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas attribute must be set to 0, and the optional feature license must be set to ENABLED. In this case, the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute is ignored and no rejection or alarm is raised. Note: An optional feature license for multiple antennas applies to all SectorCarrier MO instances in the node. It is recommended to set the SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas attribute to the requested number of TX antennas to avoid problems when having SectorCarrier MO instance with different number of TX antennas.
- SectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef For Massive MIMO, deterministic carrier allocation cannot be used. The SectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef attribute is ignored and no alarm is raised. An optional list of RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO must be deterministically allocated to the RX carrier branches in this sector carrier. This allows the user to select antenna or antenna polarization for a specific RX carrier branch. This list is required with the dual band radio when two RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO instances are created per one RfPort MO instance. The list must contain as many entries as the number of used RX antennas for this sector carrier. The first referred RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO is allocated to RX carrier branch number one, the second referred RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO is allocated to RX carrier branch number two and so on. Each referred RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO must be referred to in the associated SectorEquipmentFunction MO. If the list is left empty, non-deterministic by default, RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO allocation for the RX carrier branches takes place. Default allocation means choosing those RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MOs referenced in the SectorEquipmentFunction MO that are connected to free radio resources. Therefore, the final RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO allocation could vary. This optional list is only used if control of RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO allocation is necessary. Default allocation automatically handles radio resources limitations and allows reconfiguration for RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch failures.
- SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef For Massive MIMO, deterministic carrier allocation cannot be used. The SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute is ignored and no alarm is raised. An optional list of RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO must be deterministically allocated to the TX carrier branches in this sector carrier. This allows the user to select antenna or antenna polarization for a specific TX carrier branch. This list is required with the dual band radio when two RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO instances are created per one RfPort MO instance. The list must contain as many entries as the number of used TX antennas for this sector carrier. The first referred RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO is allocated to TX carrier branch number one, the second referred RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO is allocated to TX carrier branch number two and so on. Each referred RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO must be referred to in the associated SectorEquipmentFunction MO. If the list is left empty, non-deterministic by default, RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO allocation for the TX carrier branches takes place. Default allocation means choosing those RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MOs referenced in the SectorEquipmentFunction MO that are connected to free radio resources. Therefore, the final RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO allocation could vary. This optional list is only used if control of RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO allocation is necessary. Default allocation automatically handles radio resources limitations and allows reconfiguration for RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch failures. Deterministic carrier allocation is needed in the following cases: The same number of RF branches exist in the sector as in the sector carrier, and the number of RF branches is four. Fewer RF branches exist in the sector carrier than in the sector, and the number of RF branches in the sector carrier is at least two. If the number of RF branches in the sector and the sector carrier is four, the RfBranch or MulticastAntennaBranch MO references under the SectorCarrier MO must be sorted according to one of the following port mappings: 3GPP port mapping, where first come all branches of one polarization, then all branches of the other polarization. Alternative port mapping, where branches with different polarization follow each other.

Combined Cell

In case of combined cell, the SectorEquipmentFunction.reservedBy

attribute contains a list of SectorCarrier MO instances that

reserve this MO instance. Maximum 4 SectorCarrier can reserve the

same SectorEquipmentFunction.

Timing Advance Command in Random Access Response

The SectorCarrier.ulForcedTimingAdvanceCommand attribute forces an

additional value to the Timing Advance Command in Random Access Response and

advances the FFT windows for PUSCH, PUCCH, and SRS with the same amount of time.

This attribute is given in multiples of T0=0.52 µs.

Carrier Aggregation and Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

In case of two layers, where one layer has virtual sectors and the other layer has normal

sectors, use the following configuration to use Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing between these layers:

There are three carriers per radio. One carrier (f3) covers the full physical sector and

the other two carriers (f1 and f2) cover the virtual sectors.

Figure 4   Compatible Configuration for Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing

The default value 0 should be used for sector carriers in macro cells.

For sector carriers in micro cells, recommended setting is described with the following notation:

If d≤300 meters, the attribute should have its default value n=0.

If d&gt;300 meters, the attribute is recommended to be set to n=d divided by

cTo, where [.] denotes rounding to the nearest integer. Inserting the values for

c and T0 gives n=6.4dkm where dkm is d expressed in km.

Uplink Throughput

Uplink gain scaling can be configured by the

SectorCarrier.ulGainScalingEnabled attribute.

The noise reference level can be set by configuring the

SectorCarrier.UlGainScalingDelta attribute.

### 2.6.4 Configure Sector Carrier in AAS for FDD

Prerequisites

For TM4 support, the LicenseState of the Basic AAS for FDD feature

must be ENABLED and the FeatureState must be

ACTIVATED.

For additional TM9 support, the LicenseState of the TM9 with AAS

FDD feature must be ENABLED and the FeatureState

must be ACTIVATED.

For digital sectorization support, the LicenseState of the Digital

Sectorization with AAS FDD feature must be ENABLED and the

FeatureState must be ACTIVATED.

AAS FDD specific bandwidth HWACs are needed.

To configure TM4 support in an AAS for FDD, do the following:

Steps

1. Set the values of the SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas and SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attributes to 0.
2. Set the values of the SectorCarrier.digitalTilt and SectorCarrier.sectorShape attributes to values that are supported by the AAS capable radio unit. The supported values are shown in the Antenna Integrated Radio Unit Description.
3. Configure the SectorEquipmentFunction MO class to represent the AAS capable radio unit with the SectorCarrier.sectorFunctionRef attribute. The SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute must be configured to refer to a Transceiver MO representing the corresponding AIR FieldReplaceableUnit. Note: If the corresponding AAS capable radio unit is not configured properly, the Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm is raised.
4. To enable digital sectors, configure the SectorCarrier.sectorCarrierType attribute. For more information, see Digital Sectorization with AAS FDD.

Results

To configure additional TM9 support, set the value of

EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode attribute to

TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9.

To enable mode switching between TM4 and TM9, set the value of

EUtranCellFDD.tm9Tm4ModeSwitchingEnabled attribute to

TRUE.

### 2.6.5 Configuration of Radio Power Sharing

Radio power sharing is enabled by default, and can be configured using the

RadioPowerOverbooking.featCtrlRadioPowerOverbooking attribute. If

radio power sharing is enabled, the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute can be configured to

a higher value than the nominal output power of the radio unit.

Radio power sharing capability is specified for each radio unit. For more information on

hardware support for radio power sharing, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

For more information on radio power sharing, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Radio Power Sharing in Mixed Mode

Radio power sharing can only be configured through a Baseband Radio Node in LTE or NR

mode.

If a radio unit is connected to multiple Baseband Radio Nodes, enabling radio power

sharing on one Baseband Radio Node automatically activates radio power sharing on

the radio unit. To disable radio power sharing on the radio unit, radio power

sharing must be disabled on all connected Baseband Radio Nodes in LTE or NR

mode.

Radio power sharing supports mixed mode configurations with all RATs. For GSM, WCDMA,

and NB-IoT RATs, radio power sharing can only be enabled if one of the Baseband

Radio Nodes connected to the radio unit is in LTE or NR mode, which allow the

configuration of radio power sharing.

#### 2.6.5.1 Enable Radio Power Sharing

Steps

1. Lock the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO related to the radio unit. Note: If an NR cell is also configured on the radio unit, lock the NRCellDU MO related to the radio unit.
2. Lock the SectorCarrier MO. Note: If an NR sector carrier is also configured on the radio unit, lock the NRSectorCarrier MO.
3. Set the RadioPowerOverbooking.featCtrlRadioPowerOverbooking attribute to ON. Note: If a radio unit is connected to multiple Baseband Radio Nodes, enabling radio power sharing on one Baseband Radio Node automatically activates radio power sharing on the radio unit.
4. Set the output power using the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. Note: If an NR sector carrier is also configured on the radio unit, set the NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. On certain bands of certain radio units, some output power levels are only attainable if the following conditions are met: WCDMA and GSM carriers are not configured on the radio unit. The total number of downlink carriers, including subband carriers, used on certain branches is equal to or less than a maximum number of carriers.
5. Unlock the SectorCarrier MO. Note: If an NR sector carrier is also configured on the radio unit, unlock the NRSectorCarrier MO.
6. Unlock the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO. Note: If an NR cell is also configured on the radio unit, unlock the NRCellDU MO.

#### 2.6.5.2 Disable Radio Power Sharing

Prerequisites

The SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower MO is configured to a value

lower than or equal to the nominal output power of the radio unit.

Steps

1. Lock the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO related to the radio unit. Note: If an NR cell is also configured on the radio unit, lock the NRCellDU MO related to the radio unit.
2. Lock the SectorCarrier MO. Note: If an NR sector carrier is also configured on the radio unit, lock the NRSectorCarrier MO.
3. Set the RadioPowerOverbooking.featCtrlRadioPowerOverbooking attribute to OFF. Note: In mixed mode, radio power sharing must be disabled on all Baseband Radio Nodes in LTE or NR mode.
4. Unlock the SectorCarrier MO. Note: If an NR sector carrier is also configured on the radio unit, unlock the NRSectorCarrier MO.
5. Unlock the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO. Note: If an NR cell is also configured on the radio unit, unlock the NRCellDU MO.

## 2.7 Configure Feature Multi-Sector Per Radio

### 2.7.1 Single Sector Per Radio Preparations

Perform the following steps on a single sector per radio before

configuring the Multi-Sector Per Radio feature:

Steps

1. Lock the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO.
2. Lock the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
3. Update SectorCarrier MO with the desired rfBranches to remain on defined sector.
4. Update SectorEquipmentFunction MO with the desired rfBranches to remain on defined sector.
5. Unlock the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
6. Unlock theEUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO.

### 2.7.2 Create New Sector

Perform the following steps to create new sectors for the Multi-Sector

Per Radio feature:

Steps

1. Create new RfBranches for the new sector if needed.
2. Set the rfPortRef attribute to the wanted RfPort on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
3. Create a new SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
4. Set the rfBranchRef attribute to the desired RfBranches.
5. Create a new SectorCarrier MO. Note: The feature can be configured on a 4 TX or 4 RX radio, or a 6TX/6RX radio. The configuration is possible on a radio group with either one 2 TX and 2 RX radio, or one 0 TX and 2 RX radio, or a radio group of two 6TX/6RX radios. For in-band mode, it can also be configured on a radio group with one 4 RX and 2 TX radio, or one 2 RX and 4TX radio.

### 2.7.3 Multi-Sector Per Radio Configuration

Perform the following steps to configure the Multi-Sector Per Radio

feature:

Steps

1. Configure the configuredMaxTxPower attribute in the SectorCarrier MO for both sectors. Make sure that the sum of the power for the two sectors does not exceed the maximum allowed output power: this is determined by the license or the maximum output power of the radio unit.
2. Create a new EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO for each sector created in Create New Sector
3. Activate the Multi-Sector Per Radio license. If more than three cells have been created in one DU or Baseband unit, the 6 Cell Support feature license must also be activated. Note: If the feature is configured on a radio group, activation is not needed.
4. Unlock the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
5. Unlock the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO.

## 2.8 Configure System Information Messages

To configure SI messages, use the following attributes:

- changeNotification TOOLTIPFLAG For each SIB. Indicates when the SIB content is changed, if system information change notification is broadcast prior to broadcast of updated system information.
- mappingInfo TOOLTIPFLAG This parameter defines which SI message each SIB is included in. One or more SIBs may be included in the same SI message. If more than one SIB are to be included in the same SI message, they will have the same periodicity as defined by the value of the parameter siPeriodicity TOOLTIPFLAG for that SI message. The SI mapping for Category M Access is defined by the parameter mappingInfoCe TOOLTIPFLAG. The periodicity for Category M Access is defined by the parameter siPeriodicityCe TOOLTIPFLAG.
- modificationPeriodCoeff TOOLTIPFLAG The modification period is expressed in number of radio frames = modificationPeriodCoeff * defaultPagingCycle. The Paging-related parameters determine More information on the default Paging cycle can be found in Paging. The modificationPeriodCoeff TOOLTIPFLAG can be seen as the number of opportunities (Paging Occasions) given to an IDLE UE to detect system information change notification. Setting a large value for this parameter will increase the probability that the SI message SI Change notifications will reach all UEs, but will generate a slightly higher load during a modification period. Setting a lower value will decrease the load during a modification period, but will also decrease the probability that the SI message SI Change notifications will reach all UEs. Note: modificationPeriodCoeff * defaultPagingCycle must be equal to or less than 1024 radio frames.
- siPeriodicity TOOLTIPFLAG The parameter defines the periodicity of SI messages.
- nrOfTransmissionsSib1 The parameter controls the number of times an SIB1 message is repeated within siPeriodicity.
- siWindowLength TOOLTIPFLAG The parameter siWindowLength TOOLTIPFLAG defines length of the SI window, expressed in ms, within which each SI message is transmitted. Setting a large value for this parameter may allow message repetition (and thus greater redundancy), but can use slightly more system resources. The value for siWindowLength TOOLTIPFLAG applies to all SI messages. Note: It must be possible to schedule all SI messages within the shortest value for siPeriodicity TOOLTIPFLAG used, that is, siWindowLength * 'transmitted number of SI-messages' &lt;= MIN(siPeriodicitySIx).
- sib1AltSchInfo The sib1AltSchInfo attribute controls which scheduling list IE is used in SIB1 to inform the UE of mapping SIB19 and higher. This can occur in the following ways: The value of sib1AltSchInfo is set to false. The SchedulingInfoList IE is used. In this case, there is no change in system behavior. The value of the sib1AltSchInfo is set to true. The IEs placed in late non-critical extensions are one of the following: SchedulingInfoListExt-r12 SchedulingInfoList-v12j0 If sib1AltSchInfo is set to true, UEs capable of handling SIB19 and higher must support 3GPP CR4444 TS 36.331. Otherwise, UEs cannot receive information included in these SIBs. For example, a UE is not able to receive SIB24 with NR information if the following conditions apply: The UE is not updated according to 3GPP CR4444 TS 36.331. The value of sib1AltSchInfo is set to true. It is recommended to map SIB19 and higher after SIB2-SIB18 and not together in the same SI. Certain UEs cannot handle the following cases: SIB18- and SIB19+ are mapped in the same SI message. SI other than SI1 includes empty SIB mapping.
- Rrc.tSiChangeNotifyCellSetupInt The Rrc.tSiChangeNotifyCellSetupInt attribute controls the periodicity between the second and the eighth system information message redistribution after cell deblock. When the value of this attribute is set to 0, only the first redistribution occurs. The first system information message redistribution happens 15 seconds after the initial system information message distribution. If a high percentage of UEs are unable to read the system information after the first redistribution, this parameter can be used to enable further system information redistributions. This increases the number of UEs that read the system information.

## 2.9 Delete LTE, Remove LTE from Node

LTE can be removed from the node, to make node resources available for other Radio Access

Technologies (RAT), for example WCDMA.

To remove LTE from the node, do the following:

Steps

1. Lock all the LTE cells, see Lock Cell.
2. Delete all the LTE cells, see Delete Cell
3. Delete all the LTE Sector Carriers, see Delete Sector Carrier.
4. Delete the ENodeBFunction MO instance. Result: The ENodeBFunction MO deletion triggers a node warm restart automatically. After the restart, LTE goes into the dormant state.
5. Configure the other RAT, for example WCDMA.

# 3 Troubleshooting

## 3.1 Fault Management Related to Sector

This section describes fault management specifically related to

sector and cell management.

The cell and sector resources in the radio network are supervised

by the RBS. Alarms are issued when a cell or sector is disabled due

to failure in one or more of the resources the cell or sector uses.

The alarm on the

EUtranCellFDD

MO or

EUtranCellTDD

MO, or

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO (or both) ceases when the

SectorEquipmentFunction

, or

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

is enabled.

The alarms generated by the

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO are usually primary and the alarms on the

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

MO are usually secondary. When there is a secondary alarm on the

EUtranCellFDD

, or

EUtranCellTDD

MO, the primary fault can be found in the RBS or the transport network.

For information about alarms and fault management events, refer to the List Files folder in this library.

Specific alarm and event conditions may cause the failures described

below.

Delete Sector Failure

When a

SectorEquipmentFunction

is unlocked or has cells associated with it, the request

to delete the sector is rejected and the

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO is not deleted.

Inconsistent Hardware Configuration

A sector cannot be successfully configured because of a faulty

hardware configuration in the MOM. Refer to Inconsistent Configuration for more information.

Unlock Sector Failure

The sector cannot be enabled because of failure in one or more

resources that it needs. The alarm Resource Configuration Failure will be triggered.

Unlock Sector with License Shortage

The sector may become degraded because of a license shortage. If

the requested license is not available, the sector can use only 20

W per radio unit, which is the LTE basic functionality for output

power.

The sector will then have operational state is set to Enabled,

availability status is set to Degraded. Refer to Inconsistent Configuration if the sector

is degraded due to requesting more output power than it has available

licenses for. Refer to Resource Configuration Failure if the license

server is unavailable.

## 3.2 Fault Management Related to Cell

Unlock Cell Failure - Resource Allocation Failure

The cell

cannot be

unlocked

because

an

RERC layer cannot allocate the

resources that

are required for the cell. The reason for the failure

might

be

a lack of resources,

including licenses,

or

a

configuration error.

The

Resource Allocation Failure alarm is

raised.

For

more information about the alarm, see

Resource Allocation

Failure.

Unlock Cell Failure - Cell Failed

due

to Internal RBS Failure

Resources for the cell

are

allocated successfully, but the cell setup fails and

the value of the

CellResources.availabilityStatus attribute

becomes

DISABLED

or

DEPENDENCY\_FAILED.

This occurs if not

all required

hardware

resources

are

set up for the cell.

One of the

following

alarms is

raised:

- Resource Configuration Failure
- Service Unavailable
- Resource Allocation Failure Service Degraded

Unlock Cell Failure - Unsupported Parameter

Resources for the cell

are

allocated successfully, but configuration fails because a parameter has a value that is not

supported by one or more of the resources. The

Rescource

Configuration Failure

alarm

is raised.

For

more information about the alarm, see

Resource Configuration

Failure.

Unlock Cell Failure - Baseband Power Saving Capacity Limit Exceed

The cell unlock operation

fails

because of the high number of cells

that are

configured and unlocked,

or because

the power saving limit is exceeded for

antenna

bandwidth,

connection

between the units, or carrier group. The alarm

Power

Saving Capacity Limit Exceeded is raised.

If the cell unlock

operation fails, some

cells

can be

disabled.
