# 2 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Loss of signal

The alarm is raised if standby synchronization reference is unavailable, and the

resulting fault either stops or disturbs the traffic or the network

synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Verify that the manufacturer and model of the GNSS receiver unit are supported. For instructions on replacing and installing a GNSS receiver unit, refer to GPS Receiver System for RBS 6000 Description. If the hardware is unsupported, replace it with a model that is supported by the system, then check if the alarm has ceased.
3. Verify that the cable is connected to the FRU, including the connecting equipment. Ensure that the cable and connecting equipment are connected properly.
4. Wait for 3 minutes, then check if the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

# 7 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: GNSS receiver is not synchronized to satellites

The alarm is raised if standby synchronization reference is unavailable, and the

resulting fault either stops or disturbs the traffic or the network

synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Verify that the manufacturer and model of the GNSS receiver unit are supported.

# 8 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Reference is degraded

The alarm is raised if standby synchronization reference is unavailable, and the

resulting fault either stops or disturbs the traffic or the network

synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Verify that the manufacturer and model of the GNSS receiver unit are supported. For instructions on replacing and installing a GNSS receiver unit, refer to GPS Receiver System for RBS 6000 Description. If the hardware is unsupported, replace it with a model that is supported by the system, then check if the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Check the attribute GnssInfo.noOfSatellitesInView, and check that there are at least four visible satellites.
4. Check that the GPS antenna is installed in accordance with the instruction. Refer to GPS Receiver System for RBS 6000 Description for more information.
5. If the location of the antenna is changed, wait up to 30 minutes, then check if the alarm has ceased. The time needed by the GPS unit to provide GPS time depends on the antenna location. The location and signal strength can be read from the attributes of the GnssInfo MO.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Check the difference between the actual and the average position in the gnssReceiverResurvey action, by using the STATUS sub command under GnssInfo MO. If the difference is larger than 20 meters, initiate the manual resurvey, by using the EXECUTE sub command in the same action. For the number of satellites the recommended value is 8. To prevent this issue from occurring again, enable automatic resurvey in the ENABLE sub command in the same action.
7. Check the resurvey status using action gnssReceiverResurvey with sub command STATUS. Option Description Survey is performed immediately. Wait 30 minutes. Survey cannot be performed immediately. Wait as long as it is specified in the action gnssReceiverResurvey with sub command STATUS, then wait 30 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Check if the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Check the GNSS receiver unit model in one of the following ways:
    - Use the STATUS sub command in the gnssReceiverResurvey action.
    - Use the gpsstatus CLI command.
10. Reset the GNSS receiver unit using action gnssReceiverRestart with sub command execute if the GNSS receiver unit model is GPS 02, or higher. Then wait 30 minutes. For any other GNSS receiver unit models, go to Step 11.
11. Check if the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

12. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.
