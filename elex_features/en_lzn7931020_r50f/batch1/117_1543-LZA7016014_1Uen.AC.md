# 2 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Sync and/or delay response messages arriving irregularly

The alarm is raised if there is an availability problem of the PTP Grandmaster for

more than 1 minute.

If no standby synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb

the traffic or the network synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Choose one of the following alternates: If the PTP source is not an Ericsson RAN Grandmaster, consult the next level of maintenance support. If the PTP source is an Ericsson RAN Grandmaster, continue with the next step.
3. Verify that the PTP Grandmaster is configured in the node according to the Network Synchronization Plan.
4. If the alarm remains but there is connection toward the nearest PTP master port, contact the maintenance center for the PTP Grandmaster or the network. Request them to act on the fault. There can be a configuration fault in the network or the PTP Grandmaster might be disabled.
5. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 2 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Low announce rate detected

The alarm is raised if there is an availability problem of the PTP Grandmaster for

more than 1 minute.

If no standby synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb

the traffic or the network synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Choose one of the following alternates: If the PTP source is not an Ericsson RAN Grandmaster, consult the next level of maintenance support. If the PTP source is an Ericsson RAN Grandmaster, continue with the next step.
3. Verify that the announce rate of the parent PTP clock is configured according to the Network Synchronization Plan.
4. After making any change in configuration, wait at least 2 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Low delay request rate detected

The alarm is raised if there is an availability problem of the PTP Grandmaster for

more than 1 minute.

If no standby synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb

the traffic or the network synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Choose one of the following alternates: If the PTP source is not an Ericsson RAN Grandmaster, consult the next level of maintenance support. If the PTP source is an Ericsson RAN Grandmaster, continue with the next step.
3. Verify that the delay response rate of the parent PTP clock is configured according to the Network Synchronization Plan.
4. After making any change in configuration, wait at least 2 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Low delay response rate detected
