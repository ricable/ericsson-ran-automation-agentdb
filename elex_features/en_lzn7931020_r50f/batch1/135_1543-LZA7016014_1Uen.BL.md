# 2 Remedy Actions for DiLink: No connector inserted

The alarm is raised when there is a problem with the connection of a cable.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the faulty port if the unit at the end of the link is a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance: The attribute values can refer to the following elements, depending on the radio node configuration: A local unit (MO FieldReplaceableUnit=1 or FieldReplaceableUnit=2). A unit in a cabinet or a remote unit (MO FieldReplaceableUnit=2). The DiPort MO on the unit that the link is connected to. For example, DiPort=IDL\_A or DiPort=IDL\_B for the local unit and for the remote unit. Increments of FieldReplaceableUnit=1 can refer to the (remote) baseband.

# 4 Remedy Actions for RiLink

## 4.1 Remedy Actions for Connection between RiPorts

The RiLink represents a logical path between two RiPort endpoints that travels over

multiple physical connections of which the two endpoints are unaware. Link represents a

single physical connection between two RiPort endpoints.

No secondary alarm is raised for CPRI redundancy configurations, where the

capabilities can be managed by a single RiLink.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the faulty port if the unit at the end of the link is a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance: The attribute values can refer to the following depending on the node configuration: A local unit (MO FieldReplaceableUnit=1 or FieldReplaceableUnit=2), or to a unit in a cabinet or to a remote unit (MO FieldReplaceableUnit=2). The RiPort MO on the unit that the link is connected to. For example, RiPortA to RiPortF for the local unit, and Data1 or Data2 for the remote unit. Increments of FieldReplaceableUnit=1 can refer to the (remote) radio or baseband.
    1. Find the faulty RiLink.riLinkId attribute.
    2. Check the RiLink MO, and the RiLink.riPortRef1 and RiLink.riPortRef2 attributes of the faulty link on both ends of the link.
3. Check if any alarms are raised. Resolve synchronization, clock, SW Error, and HW Fault alarms first.
4. Find the RiLink MO suspected to be faulty. Use the RiLink.riLinkId attribute representing the link.
5. Check the value of the RiLink.transportType attribute. If the value is not NOT\_SET or CPRI\_OVER\_DIRECT\_CABLE, do the following:
    1. Check if an alarm is raised on the ME that the link refers to, and act on that alarm.
    2. Check if the link that refers to the ME is faulty. If the ME is faulty, consult the next level of maintenance support.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Check if the correct SFP is mounted on both ends of the link. If the configuration is correct, do the following: Check if the modules match. Check the fiber length. Use command invx to check the CPRI length.Note: For the CPRI length limitation, see SFP Module Selector Guide. When Radio or AIR with two CPRI cables connected to the same Radio or AAS, the fiber length in both CPRI links must not exceed 100 m. Check maximum and minimum operating temperature.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

7. Restart the unit at the near-end of the link. Restarting the unit affects traffic.
8. Wait 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Collect the DCGM file. For more information about collecting the DCGM file, see Data Collection Guideline.
10. Send a technician to the site.
11. Locate the cable between each RiPort hardware unit, riPortRef1 and riPortRef2, and find the alarming unit. Identify the unit and the port based on the additional text.
12. Check the equipment that is used for the faulty link.
    - If it is not working as expected, act on it first.
    - If it is not working as expected and cannot be acted on, consult the next level of support.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

13. Check in SFP Module Selector Guide if the two SFPs match. If not, change at least one of them in the following way:
    1. Check the most accessible SFP module. If the connector looks dirty or damaged, clean or change it.
    2. Replace the most accessible SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.
    3. Replace the cable if it is damaged.
    4. Check the second SFP. If the connector looks dirty or damaged, clean or change it.
    5. Replace the second SFP. If the problem remains, change it back.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. If the units are not restarted remotely, restart the units at both ends of the link. Take the steps as described. Wait 60 seconds after each step, and check if the alarm remains.
    1. If mixed mode is indicated in the additional text, restart the unit at the far-end of the link. Check the SFP modules, cables, and connectors according to the following steps: Note: Restarting the unit can affect the traffic on the node.
    2. Restart the unit at the near-end of the link. Note: Restarting the unit can affect the traffic on the node. If the near-end unit is a Baseband unit, wait 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

15. Check the following and wait 60 seconds after each step. For more information about SFP modules and cables, see the following documentation: SFP Module Selector Guide Handling SFP Modules and Optical Cables
    1. If the fiber length is not correct, replace the fiber.
    2. If the cable is damaged, replace the cable.
    3. Check maximum and minimum operating temperature.
    4. If the banding radius is at the minimum, replace the cable.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

16. Consult the next level of maintenance support, or perform the remedy actions on the unit at the ends of the link.

## 4.2 Remedy Actions for Connection between RiPort and RiNetwork

The RiLink represents a single physical connection between two port endpoints where

one endpoint is RiPort MO instance on the

FiledReplaceableUnit MO instance, and the second endpoint is

RiNetwork MO instance.

For more information about the RiLink MO that connects a

RiNetwork MO and a radio unit, radio gateway, or LC-05 9×CPRI

line card, seeManage Hardware Equipment.

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the faulty port if the unit at the end of the link is a RiNetwork MO instance: The attribute values can refer to the following: The RiPort MO on the unit that the link is connected to. For example, RiPortA to RiPortF for the local unit, and Data1 or Data2 for the remote unit. The RiNetwork MO representing fronthaul equipment.
    1. Find the faulty RiLink.riLinkId attribute.
    2. Check the RiLink MO, and the RiLink.riPortRef1 and RiLink.riPortRef2 attributes of the faulty link on both ends of the link.
3. Check if any alarms are raised. Resolve synchronization, clock, SW Error, and HW Fault alarms first.
4. Find the RiLink MO instance suspected to be faulty. Use the RiLink.riLinkId attribute representing the link.
5. Check if an alarm is raised on the ME that the link refers to (represented by RiNetwork MO), and act on that alarm.
6. Check if the link that refers to the ME is faulty. If the ME is faulty, consult the next level of maintenance support.

If the alarm remains, do the following:
