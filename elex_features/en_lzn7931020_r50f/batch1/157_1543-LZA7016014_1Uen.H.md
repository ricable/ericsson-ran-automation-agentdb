# 2 Remedy Actions for GnssInfo: GNSS receiver firmware download failed

The GNSS Receiver Firmware Upgrade Failure alarm is

raised three days after the Baseband restarted and if three attempts failed to

download the firmware.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check that the cable and the connecting equipment between the Baseband unit and the GNSS receiver unit are connected properly.
3. Restart the Baseband unit and the GNSS receiver unit.
4. Wait for at least 90 minutes, then verify that the GnssInfo.gnssReceiverFwUpgradeStatus attribute is set to OK. It indicates successful firmware upgrade. Note: The 90 minutes time interval covers three attempts to upgrade the firmware. The upgrade can succeed after 30 or 60 minutes. Hence the GnssInfo.gnssReceiverFwUpgradeStatus attribute can be checked already at these two occasions.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Actions for GnssInfo: GNSS receiver firmware mismatch

The GNSS Receiver Firmware Upgrade Failure alarm is

raised if all of the following conditions apply:

- A node trying to upgrade GNSS receiver firmware detected that the GNSS receiver is executing firmware of older revision than the upgrade package firmware revision.
- Three days passed since Baseband restart.

The GNSS receiver downloaded the upgrade package firmware file but it is not using

it. The following reasons can cause it:

- The GNSS receiver failed to start with the latest downloaded upgrade package firmware and autonomously rolled back to an older firmware revision.
- The GNSS receiver did not receive response from any node and autonomously rolled back to an older firmware revision.
- A user forced the GNSS receiver to use an older firmware revision by an MO action.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Display the GnssInfo.gnssReceiverFirmware attribute to check the firmware revision of each slot and the currently executing slot. Restart the GNSS receiver on the slot with the latest firmware revision by using the MO action GnssInfo.gnssReceiverRestartFromSlot.
3. Wait for five minutes, then verify that the GnssInfo.gnssReceiverFwUpgradeStatus attribute is set to OK. It indicates successful firmware upgrade.

If the alarm reappears with the same additional text, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Actions for GnssInfo: GNSS receiver rejected file transfer

The GNSS Receiver Firmware Upgrade Failure alarm is

raised if all of the following conditions apply:

- A node trying to upgrade the GNSS receiver firmware detected that the GNSS receiver rejected the file transfer attempt three consecutive times.
- Three days passed since Baseband restart.

This problem is in all possible cases related to the Baseband software.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Actions for GnssInfo: GNSS receiver rejected firmware

The GNSS Receiver Firmware Upgrade Failure alarm is

raised if all of the following conditions apply:

- A node trying to upgrade the GNSS receiver firmware detected that the GNSS receiver rejected the transferred upgrade package firmware file.
- Three days passed since Baseband restart.

This problem is in all possible cases related to the Baseband software.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 6 Remedy Actions for GnssInfo: No control path to the GNSS receiver

The GNSS Receiver Firmware Upgrade Failure alarm is

raised if all of the following conditions apply:

- A node trying to upgrade GNSS receiver firmware detected that no node is in control of GNSS receiver.
- Three days passed since Baseband restart.

The cause of this problem is that the Baseband is not connected to the GNSS receiver

directly, for example it can be connected through a digital splitter.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Verify that at least one Baseband is connected to the GNSS receiver directly, not through a digital splitter.
3. Ensure that the cable is connected properly.
4. Wait at least one minute, then check that the GnssInfo.gnssReceiverControl attribute shows the following message on the Baseband that is directly connected to the GNSS receiver: This node is in control of GNSS receiver.

If the alarm remains, or reappears with the same additional text, do the

following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 7 Remedy Actions for GnssInfo: Sky visibility too poor

The GNSS Receiver Firmware Upgrade Failure alarm is

raised if all of the following conditions apply:

- The GNSS receiver downloaded upgrade package firmware file.
- The GNSS receiver is locked to satellites.
- The Baseband evaluated that sky visibility is poor.
- Three days passed since Baseband restart.

The node restarts the GNSS receiver with the new firmware if there are at least five

satellites with sufficient SNR for at least 60 minutes.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the GPS antenna is installed in accordance with the instruction. For more information, see GPS Receiver System for RBS 6000 Description.
3. Check that there are at least four visible satellites having SNR above 40 in the GnssInfo.noOfSatellitesInView attribute. If necessary, change the satellite configuration in the GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted attribute.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Restart the GNSS receiver manually on the firmware slot containing the latest available firmware revision by using the MO action gnssReceiverRestartFromSlot. Note: Performing this step risks losing timing usability (1PPS output) during the GNSS receiver restart and possibly also after its recovery.
5. Wait for 5 minutes, then verify that the GnssInfo.gnssReceiverFwUpgradeStatus attribute is set to OK. It indicates successful firmware upgrade.

If the alarm reappears with the same additional text, do the following:

6. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
