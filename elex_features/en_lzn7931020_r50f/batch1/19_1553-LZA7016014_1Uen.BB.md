# 1 Descriptions

Automated Neighbor Relations (ANR) is a feature that enables the

RBS to automatically detect and perform the following actions:

- Add external RBSs
- Add external cells
- Add cell relations used for handover
- Automatically set up X2

ANR is divided into the following functions, with support for:

- Intra-frequency E-UTRAN
- Inter-frequency E-UTRAN
- Inter-mode inter-frequency E-UTRAN
- UTRAN
- GERAN
- NR Standalone and EN-DC deployment

## 1.1 Concepts

### 1.1.1 External Cell

External cells in an eNodeB hold information about cells in other eNodeBs or cells in GERAN,

UTRAN or NR.

### 1.1.2 Cell Relation

Relations are made between cells and are used for handover using

the S1 or X2 interfaces. Handover over X2 requires an X2 connection.

The ANR feature can initiate the establishment of X2 connections.

### 1.1.3 Frequency Relation

The frequency relation points to frequencies on which the cell

can have neighbor cells.

### 1.1.4 Neighbor Cell

Between neighboring cells, cell relations can be created. The cell

relation allows for example handover between neighboring cells.

## 1.2 Detection of Neighbor Cells

The ANR feature uses User Equipment (UE) measurements of the following

types to detect neighbor cells:

- Handover measurements, for example best cell evaluation
- ANR initiated measurements

## 1.3 Event Based ANR Measurements

Event based ANR measurements detects neighbor cells before UE have

reported them in mobility reports for handover.

The process employed by the UE for the event based evaluations

of surrounding cells uses parameters sent by the serving RBS to the

UE. The ANR function use reports from the UE to identify neighbor

cells.

For parameters to adjust the report volume, see Configure ANR Measurement Reports.

3GPP TS 36.214 defines the quantities Reference

Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality

(RSRQ).

Further information on the uses of UE measurements can be found

in Intra-LTE Handover and Manage Performance.

## 1.4 UE Measurement Reports

The ANR feature adds neighbor cells when UE measurement reports

indicate that a possible new neighbor relationship has been identified.

The ANR feature cannot identify neighbor cell relations without UE

measurement reports.

RBS parameters control UE measurement reports. The parameters are

used for UE report configuration. Most of those parameters belong

to the managed area radio network and are also used for other mobility

functions such as handover and session continuity.

- The UeMeasControl TOOLTIPFLAG MO is the parent MO for the UE measurement report parameters.
- The ReportConfigEUtraBestCellAnr TOOLTIPFLAG and ReportConfigA5Anr TOOLTIPFLAG MOs hold parameters specific for the UE measurements initiated by the ANR for E-UTRAN functions. There are report-triggering parameters such as UE received signal thresholds, offset, hysteresis, and time to trigger.
- The EUtranFreqRelation holds parameters for excluding cells in UE measurement reports.

In ANR for UTRAN measurements, the UE measures signal strength

on cells on a frequency requested by the RBS. The UE reports only

the strongest cell. The

UeMeasControl.measQuantityUtraFDD

parameter controls the measurement quantity used for all

types of UTRAN measurements. For information about ANR UE measurement

configuration, see Manage Mobility.

The

EUtranFreqRelation

MO must exist before the RBS can order any UE measurements

on the frequency represented by the MO. The operator must always create

the

EUtranFreqRelation

MO for both the intra-frequency ANR and the inter-frequency

ANR. The operator must also create both the

UtranFreqRelation

MO and the

GeranFreqGroupRelation

MO for ANR UTRAN and GERAN support.

## 1.5 Addition of ANR-Related E-UTRAN MOs

The Automated Neighbor Relations for E-UTRAN function creates and deletes instances of the

following MOs:

- ExternalENodeBFunction
- ExternalEUtranCellFDD TOOLTIPFLAG
- ExternalEUtranCellTDD TOOLTIPFLAG
- EUtranCellRelation
- TermPointToENB TOOLTIPFLAG

The MOs listed above can be created in one of the following ways:

- Defined by an operator through the OSS
- Initiated by a message over X2 from a neighbor RBS

Automated Neighbor Relations automatically adds and removes the MO structures depending on

the parameter setting.

Automated Neighbor Relations performs the following actions when the UE reports a new

neighbor cell with a PCI not tied to any present neighbor cell relation:

- Requests the UE to report the CGI of the neighbor cell.
- Creates an ExternalENodeBFunction MO if the CGI report is received and the new neighbor cell belongs to an unknown RBS. Unknown RBS means that the RBS is not listed in the existing neighbor list.
- Creates a new ExternalEUtranCellFDD TOOLTIPFLAG or ExternalEUtranCellTDD TOOLTIPFLAGMO for the reported cell.
- Creates a new EUtranCellRelation MO for the neighbor cell relation.
- Creates a new TermPointToENB TOOLTIPFLAG MO if the new neighbor cell belongs to an external RBS and there are no restrictions for an X2 connection.
- Initiates X2 setup by unlocking the TermPointToENB TOOLTIPFLAG MO.

The

x2SetupPolicy

and

x2BlackList

parameters control restrictions for X2 establishment. X2 setup and removal is

described in X2

Configuration.

The

x2BlackList

parameter controls restrictions for X2 establishment.

The RBS that receives an X2 setup request creates a corresponding

MO structure as described in the list above, but excludes the cell

relation. The created MOs are based on the cell configuration information

received in the X2 setup request as described in X2 Configuration.

## 1.6 Addition of ANR-Related UTRAN MOs

The ANR for UTRAN function creates instances of the following MOs:

- FDD only: ExternalUtranCellFDD TOOLTIPFLAG
- UtranCellRelation TOOLTIPFLAG

The MOs listed above can alternatively be created in one of the

following ways:

- Defined by an operator through the OSS
- Initiated by a message over S1 from a neighbor RBS

ANR automatically adds the MO structures depending on the parameter

setting as described in Procedures.

ANR performs the following when UE reports a new neighbor cell

with a Scrambling Code (SC) not tied to any present cell relation:

- Requests the UE to report the CGI of the neighbor cell
- FDD only: Creates an ExternalUtranCellFDD TOOLTIPFLAG MO for the reported cell
- Creates a new UtranCellRelation TOOLTIPFLAG MO for the neighbor relation, as long as maxNrUtranCellRelations TOOLTIPFLAG has not been exceeded

## 1.7 Addition of ANR-Related NR MOs

The Automated Neighbor Relations

feature creates

the following MOs for EN-DC and NR standalone

deployments:

- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo
- ExternalGNodeBFunction
- ExternalGUtranCell
- GUtranCellRelation
- TermPointToGNB Note: The TermPointToGNB MO is only created for EN-DC deployments.

The listed MOs can be created in one of the following ways:

- Defined by an operator through the OSS
- Initiated after the eNodeB receives a B1 measurement report, triggered by LTE-to EN-DC or LTE-to-NR standalone mobility

## 1.8 Removal of ANR-Related MOs

ANR related MOs are removed by one of the following actions:

- The operator manually ordered them.
- Certain configurable time periods have elapsed with no communication to the neighbor cell.

# 2 Procedures

Manual configuration of the ANR Function includes setting a number

of parameters that define the ANR behavior. There is no particular

order in which parameters must be changed.

Attention!

Risk of data loss or data corruption.

![Image](../images/19_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.BB/additional_3_CP.png)

Attention!

Risk of system malfunction or traffic disturbance.

## 2.1 Activate ANR

Steps

1. Install licenses and activate the feature state as described in Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes. Activating the feature state can alternatively be performed as a final activity when other attribute settings for ANR are completed.
2. Activate ANR to be used in the eNodeB as follows: For NR node level support, use the AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute. To enable LTE-to-NR Standalone Automated Neighbor Relations, set the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute to a non-negative value. To display PLMN information for Automated Neighbor Relations for cells with multiple NR TACs, use the following attributes: ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.createdBy ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.externalBroadcastPLMNInfoId ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC GUtranCellRelation.mobilityStatusNR For creating internal NR-to-NR neighbor objects, use the AnrFunctionNR.anrEndcX2Enabled attribute in the gNodeB. For intra-frequency ANR, use the AnrFunctionEUtran.anrIntraFreqState attribute. For inter-frequency ANR, use the AnrFunctionEUtran.anrInterFreqState attribute. For UTRAN ANR, use the AnrFunctionUtran.anrStateUtran attribute. For GERAN ANR, use the AnrFunctionGeran.anrStateGsm attribute. For ANR detection of problematic E-UTRAN cells, use the AnrFunction.problematicCellPolicy attribute. For ANR detection of problematic GERAN cells, use the AnrFunctionGeran.problematicCellPolicy attribute. For ANR PCI Handling of Problematic Cells, use the following attributes: AnrFunction.pciConflictDetectionEcgiMeas AnrFunction.pciConflictMobilityEcgiMeas For detection and removal of obsolete external E-UTRAN neighbor objects, use the following attributes: AnrFunction.detectObsoleteExtCellsEnabled AnrFunction.s1HoPrepConsFailThres For ANR Whitelist PLMN IDs, use the following attributes: AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListEnabled for E-UTRAN AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListUtranEnabled for UTRAN AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListGeranEnabled for GERAN
3. Create frequency relation MOs as follows for each frequency: Note: The MOs in the following list can already be created for other reasons such as mobility and performance management. The anrMeasOn attribute is used for switching on and off ANR measurements per frequency level. When measurements are off, no new relations are created. Therefore, switching off measurements is a way to switch off ANR by the frequency relation method. For LTE-to-NR Standalone ANR, set the NRCellDU.secondaryCellOnly attribute to false, allowing the SIB1 message to be broadcast. For intra-frequency ANR, create an EUtranFreqRelation MO regarding the EUtranFrequency MO that represents the frequency for intra-frequency ANR. This MO is also a prerequisite for inter-frequency ANR and ANR UTRAN. For inter-frequency ANR, create an EUtranFreqRelation MO regarding the EUtranFrequency MO that represents the frequency for inter-frequency ANR. For ANR UTRAN, create a UtranFreqRelation MO regarding the UtranFrequency MO that represents the frequency for ANR UTRAN.

## 2.2 Deactivate ANR

Deactivate ANR by setting the following attributes:

- For NR node level support, use the AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute.
- To disable Automated Neighbor Relations for NR Standalone deployment, set the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute to a negative value.
- For creating internal NR-to-NR neighbor objects, use the AnrFunctionNR.anrEndcX2Enabled attribute in the gNodeB.
- For intra-frequency ANR, use the AnrFunctionEUtran.anrIntraFreqState attribute.
- For inter-frequency ANR, use the AnrFunctionEUtran.anrInterFreqState attribute.
- For UTRAN ANR, use the AnrFunctionUtran.anrStateUtran attribute.
- For GERAN ANR, use the AnrFunctionGeran.anrStateGsm attribute.
- For ANR detection of problematic E-UTRAN cells, use the AnrFunction.problematicCellPolicy attribute.
- For ANR detection of problematic GERAN cells, use the AnrFunctionGeran.problematicCellPolicy attribute.
- For ANR PCI Handling of Problematic Cells, use the following attributes: AnrFunction.pciConflictDetectionEcgiMeas AnrFunction.pciConflictMobilityEcgiMeas
- For detection and removal of obsolete external E-UTRAN neighbor objects, use the following attributes: AnrFunction.detectObsoleteExtCellsEnabled AnrFunction.s1HoPrepConsFailThres
- For ANR Whitelist PLMN IDs, use the following attributes: AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListEnabled AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListUtranEnabled AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListGeranEnabled

## 2.3 Configure Thresholds for Adding Neighbor E-UTRAN Cells

Steps

To adjust thresholds for automatic addition of neighboring

E-UTRAN cells, use the following parameters:

1. AnrFunctionEUtran.cellAddRsrpThresholdEutran for power level
2. AnrFunctionEUtran.cellAddRsrqThresholdEutran for quality level

## 2.4 Configure Thresholds for Adding Neighbor UTRAN Cells

Steps

To adjust thresholds for automatic addition of neighboring

UTRAN cells, use the following parameters:

1. AnrFunctionUtran.cellAddRscpThresholdUtranDelta TOOLTIPFLAG
2. AnrFunctionUtran.cellAddEcNoThresholdUtranDelta TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.5 Configure NCGI Measurement

The eNodeB must be configured to enable NCGI measurement on a referenced NR frequency

in ANR.

For ANR for NR Standalone deployment, NCGI measurements are triggered

by the B1 NR SA measurements. The framework for initiating the B1 NR SA measurements

is reused from the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature.

Prerequisites

- The Automated Neighbor Relations feature must be activated on the eNodeB.
- The AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute must be set to ACTIVATED.
- The GUtranFreqrelation.AnrMeasOn attribute is set to true to activate ANR on a frequency level.

For more information about the NCGI of NR cells used in ANR, see the following

documentation:

- Manage Radio Network NR
- NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

Steps

1. Set the GUtranFreqRelation.anrMeasOn attribute to true.

## 2.6 Reconfiguring Problematic Cell Policy

Both the E-UTRAN problematic cell policy and the GERAN problematic cell policy can be

changed through MO configuration options.

The AnrFunction.problematicCellPolicy attribute can be used to change the

E-UTRAN problematic cell policy.

The AnrFunctionGeran.problematicCellPolicy attribute can be used to change

the GERAN problematic cell policy.

The AnrFunction.barringLowHoAllowed attribute can be used to ensure that a

cell relation cannot be barred by the detection of

problematic

cells function. Cell relations that have a low handover success rate are

not barred for mobility if the following conditions apply:

- The value of the AnrFunction.barringLowHoAllowed attribute is set to false.
- The value of the AnrFunction.problematicCellPolicy attribute is set to AUTO\_DETECT\_AND\_BAR.

## 2.7 Reconfiguring Thresholds and Time Periods for ANR Detection of Problematic Cells

To adjust thresholds, use the following parameters:

- AnrFunction.probCellDetectMedHoSuccThres
- AnrFunction.probCellDetectLowHoSuccThres

To adjust time periods, use the following parameters:

- AnrFunction.probCellDetectMedHoSuccTime
- AnrFunction.probCellDetectLowHoSuccTime

## 2.8 Reconfiguring DRX Parameters for ANR PCI Handling of Problematic Cells

To adjust DRX parameters, use the following parameters:

- AnrPciConflictDrxProfile.anrPciConflictDrxInactivityTimer
- AnrPciConflictDrxProfile.anrPciConflictLongDrxCycle
- AnrPciConflictDrxProfile.anrPciConflictOnDurationTimer

## 2.9 Reconfiguring ANR Whitelist PLMN ids

The ANR Whitelist PLMN ids function enables the operator to configure PLMN ids to be

whitelisted. When the function is activated, it prevents mobility to cells with

non-whitelisted PLMN ids.

If the plmnWhiteList attribute is empty, all target cells for any RAT

type are allowed for mobility.

Activating ANR Whitelist PLMN ids

To activate the ANR Whitelist PLMN ids function for specific RATs, set the following

attributes to TRUE:

- AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListEnabled for E-UTRAN
- AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListUtranEnabled for UTRAN
- AnrFunction.plmnWhiteListGeranEnabled for GERAN

New PLMN id Whitelist Configuration

To define new PLMN id whitelist, common for E-UTRAN, UTRAN, and GERAN, create the

PlmnInfo MO and set the following attributes:

- PlmnInfo.actualPlmn, which contains all the PLMN ids where plmnWhiteList is applied
- PlmnInfo.plmnWhiteList, which contains the list of all PLMN ids that are whitelisted, that is, available for handover

Periodic CGI and ECGI Measurements

When the PLMN ids for target cells are updated on the eNodeB, periodic CGI or ECGI

measurement reports can be used to revise it on the eNodeB.

To enable or disable periodic CGI or ECGI measurements for ANR Whitelist PLMN ids,

use the following attributes for each specific RAT:

- AnrFunction.perCgiMeasPlmnWhiteListGeran for GERAN
- AnrFunction.perCgiMeasPlmnWhiteListUtran for UTRAN
- AnrFunction.perEcgiMeasPlmnWhiteList for E-UTRAN

## 2.10 Remove Unused Neighbor Relations from LTE to NR Cell

The Automated Neighbor Relations feature can remove the unused neighbor relations by

deleting the GUtranCellRelation MO.

Prerequisites

- Automated neighbor relations for NR EN-DC or NR Standalone deployment is active.
- The GUtranCellRelation MO is unused for the configured time. Note: For determining the last use of the GUtranCellRelation MO, the EN-DC setup and the preparation of handover attempt is checked.

Steps

1. Enable the removal of the unused EN-DC or NR Standalone cell by setting GUtranCellRelation.isRemovedAllowed attribute to true and the GUtranCellRelation.essEnabled attribute to false.

Results

The Automated Neighbor Relations feature automatically removes the unused neighbor

relations from LTE to EN-DC or LTE to NR Standalone deployment.

### 2.10.1 Remove Relations to Unused ExternalGUtranCell

The ExternalGUtranCell MO becomes unused when no

GUtranCellRelation MO referring to

ExternalGUtranCell exists.

The ExternalGUtranCell MO is removed if it remains unused during

the configured period.

The AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute is set to

ACTIVATED.

Steps

1. Set the ExternalGUtranCell.isRemoveAllowed attribute to TRUE.

Results

The unused ExternalGUtranCell MO is removed if the difference

between the current time and the value of the

ExternalGUtranCell.removingMonitoringStart attribute is

larger than the value of the AnrFunction.removeNcellTime

attribute.

### 2.10.2 Remove Relations to Unused TermPointToGNB

The TermPointToGNB MO is removed when the last

ExternalGUtranCell MO is removed from the

ExternalGNodeBFunction MO.

Steps

1. Set the AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute to ACTIVATED.

Results

The TermPointToGNB MO is removed.

### 2.10.3 Remove Relations to Unused ExternalGNodeBFunction

The ExternalGNodeBFunction MO becomes unused when there is no

child ExternalGUtranCell MO.

Prerequisites

Configure the period after which the ExternalGNodeBFunction MO is

removed through the AnrFunction.removeNgnbTime attribute.

Steps

1. Set the AnrFunction.anrStateNR attribute to ACTIVATED.

Results

The unused ExternalGNodeBFunction MO is removed if the difference

between the current time and the value of the

ExternalGNodeBFunction.removingMonitoringStart attribute is

larger than the value of the AnrFunction.removeNgbnTime

attribute.

## 2.11 Remove Relations to E-UTRAN Cells

Steps

ANR can remove MOs from being able to have any relation

to E-UTRAN cells. To reconfigure restrictions for automatic removal

of ANR-related MOs, use the following parameters:

1. AnrFunction.removeNcellTime
2. AnrFunction.removeNenbTime
3. AnrFunction.removeNrelTime
4. EUtranCellRelation.isRemoveAllowed
5. Depending on whether it is an FDD or TDD cell: FDD: ExternalEUtranCellFDD.isRemoveAllowed TDD: ExternalEUtranCellTDD.isRemoveAllowed

## 2.12 Remove Relations to E-UTRAN Cells in Case of Swapping Nodes

Use the specified parameters to automatically detect and remove obsolete external

E-UTRAN cells, cell relations, and corresponding MOs when external nodes are

swapped.

Prerequisites

The Automated Neighbor Relations license is active.

Steps

1. Activate the function using the AnrFunction.detectObsoleteExtCellsEnabled parameter.
2. Use the AnrFunction.s1HoPrepConsFailThres parameter to set the threshold for the number of consecutive outgoing S1 preparation handover failures. The default value is 50.

## 2.13 Remove Relations to UTRAN Cells

Steps

ANR can remove MOs from being able to have any relation

to UTRAN cells. To reconfigure restrictions for automatic removal

of ANR-related MOs, use the following parameters:

1. AnrFunction.removeNcellTime
2. AnrFunction.removeNrelTime
3. UtranCellRelation.isRemoveAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG
4. Depending on whether it is an FDD or TDD cell: FDD only: ExternalUtranCellFDD.isRemoveAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG TDD only: ExternalUtranCellTDD.isRemoveAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.14 Remove Relations to GERAN Cells

Steps

ANR can remove MOs from being able to have any relation

to GERAN cells. To reconfigure restrictions for automatic removal

of ANR-related MOs, use the following parameters:

1. AnrFunction.removeNcellTime
2. AnrFunction.removeNrelTime
3. GeranCellRelation.isRemoveAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG
4. ExternalGeranCell.isRemoveAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.15 Reconfigure Handover Restrictions

Steps

To define default handover restrictions for new E-UTRAN

and UTRAN (FDD only) neighbor cells, use the following parameters:

1. AnrFunctionEUtran.hoAllowedEutranPolicy
2. AnrFunctionUtran.hoAllowedUtranPolicy TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.16 Reconfigure RAN Information Management Association Attempts

The Automated Neighbor Relations feature can initiate RAN Information Management procedures

to set up associations to UTRAN and GERAN to enable redirection that contains system

information. This is also known as Network Assisted Cell Change (NACC).

Steps

Enable or disable RAN Information Management associations as follows:

1. For RAN Information Management to UTRAN, use parameter AnrFunctionUtran.rimIntegrationEnabled.
2. For RAN Information Management to GERAN ANR, use parameter AnrFunctionGeran.rimIntegrationEnabled.

## 2.17 Configure ANR Measurement Reports

ANR Report-triggering parameters such as UE received signal thresholds,

offset, hysteresis, and time to trigger, belong to the radio network.

The primary MOs that contain those specific types of parameter are

ReportConfigEUtraBestCellAnr

and

ReportConfigA5Anr

.

Steps

1. Set ANR initiated measurement reporting conditions for single UEs by using the following parameters: AnrFunction.maxTimeEventBasedPciConf UeMeasControl.maxNoMeasReportsInact
2. Adjust intra-frequency neighbor cell reporting volume from UE by setting the following parameters: EUtranFreqRelation.anrMeasOn AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesEUtraIntraFDecr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesEUtraIntraFIncrAnr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesEUtraIntraFIncrHo AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesEUtraIntraFMax AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesEUtraIntraFMin
3. Adjust inter-frequency neighbor cell reporting volume from UE by setting the following parameters: EUtranFreqRelation.anrMeasOn AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesThreshInterFDecr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesThreshInterFIncrAnr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesThreshInterFIncrHo AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesThreshInterFMax AnrFunctionEUtran.anrUesThreshInterFMin
4. Adjust UTRAN neighbor cell reporting volume from UE by setting the following parameters: UtranFreqRelation.anrMeasOn TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionUtran.anrUtranMeasReportMax TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionUtran.anrUtranMeasReportMin TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionUtran.anrUtranMeasReportDecr TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionUtran.anrUtranMeasReportIncr TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionUtran.anrUtranAcMeasOn TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionUtran.anrUtranMeasReportAcIncr TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunction.maxNoMeasReportsInact
5. Adjust GERAN neighbor cell reporting volume from UE by setting the following parameters: GeranFreqGroupRelation.anrMeasOn TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionGeran.anrGeranMeasReportMax TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionGeran.anrGeranMeasReportMin TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionGeran.anrGeranMeasReportDecr TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionGeran.anrGeranMeasReportIncr TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionGeran.anrGeranRacMeasOn TOOLTIPFLAG AnrFunctionGeran.anrGeranMeasReportRacIncr TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.18 Measure A3 Measurement for ANR

The A3 measurement implies that one or several neighbor cells become better than the

serving cell also when some offset and hysteresis values are taken into account. A general

A3 measurement configuration is described in Manage

Mobility.

Steps

A3 measurements for ANR use the following parameters in the

ReportConfigEUtraBestCellAnr

MO class, relating to the general A3 measurement parameters:

1. a3offsetAnrDelta TOOLTIPFLAG
2. hysteresisA3 TOOLTIPFLAG
3. timeToTriggerA3 TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.19 Measure A5 Measurement for ANR

The A5 measurement implies that the serving cell becomes worse than a first threshold, and

neighbor cell becomes better than a second threshold. A general A5 measurement configuration

is described in Manage

Mobility.

Steps

A5 measurements for ANR use the following parameters relating to the general A5

measurement parameters in the

ReportConfigA5

MO class:

1. triggerQuantityA5 TOOLTIPFLAG
2. a5Threshold1RsrpAnrDelta TOOLTIPFLAG
3. a5Threshold1RsrqAnrDelta TOOLTIPFLAG
4. a5Threshold2RsrpAnrDelta TOOLTIPFLAG
5. a5Threshold2RsrqAnrDelta TOOLTIPFLAG
6. hysteresisA5 TOOLTIPFLAG
7. timeToTriggerA5 TOOLTIPFLAG
