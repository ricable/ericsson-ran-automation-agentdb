# 2 Remedy Action for AntennaUnitGroup: Signal level too low

The Calibration Failure alarm is raised

when several consecutive radio calibration attempts fail.

The level of the received calibration measurement signal is too low. This situation

indicates for example a broken cable.

If all antennas have a fault indication, the problem might be in

the calibration cable or the calibration related parts of the radio.

The affected cells generate the Service

Degraded alarm.

Beam-forming performance is degraded.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the affected cells by checking which cells the Service Degraded alarm is issued.
3. Lock and unlock the affected cells. A calibration is performed after each lock and unlock procedure. It is necessary to wait 1 minute before checking whether the alarm has ceased.
4. Lock the affected cells.
5. Check the Additional Information of the alarm to see which RF branch is failing.

If all RF branches are failing, do the following:

6. Check the calibration cable. The calibration cable has the connector marking CAL or RET, depending on the radio unit type.
    - Visually inspect the cable.
    - Change or connect cable if necessary.

If one or a few, but not all RF branches are failing, do the following:

7. Check the feeder cable connected to the failing antenna by doing the following:
    - Check that the feeder is connected properly to the antenna in accordance with the appropriate document in RBS Site Products library.
    - Check that there is no short circuit in the feeder and antenna system in accordance with the appropriate document in RBS Site Products library.
    - Check that there is no water in the feeder.
    - Change the feeder if necessary.
8. Unlock the cells.
9. Wait 1 minute.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

10. Lock the affected cells.
11. Restart the radio unit.
12. Unlock the cells.
13. Wait 1 minute.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. Lock the affected cells.
15. Lock the radio unit.
16. Change the radio unit. See Replacing Radio Units and Replacing Remote Radio Units.
17. Unlock the changed radio unit.
18. Unlock the cells.
19. Wait 1 minute.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

20. Put the original radio unit back. See Fault Management for more information about further actions to take before contacting next level of support.
21. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for AntennaUnitGroup: Signal disturbed

The Calibration Failure alarm is raised

when several consecutive radio calibration attempts fail.

The signal is disturbed or corrupted in such a way that it is not possible to

estimate the calibration parameters. This indicates that there is a problem in the

radio or a strong disturbance during the calibration.

If all antennas have a fault indication, the problem might be in

the calibration cable or the calibration related parts of the radio.

The affected cells generate the Service

Degraded alarm.

Beam-forming performance is degraded.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the affected cells by checking which cells the Service Degraded alarm is issued.
3. Lock and unlock the affected cells. A calibration is performed after each lock and unlock procedure. It is necessary to wait 1 minute before checking whether the alarm has ceased.
4. Lock the affected cells.
5. Restart the radio unit.
6. Unlock the cells.
7. Wait 1 minute.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Lock the affected cells.
9. Lock the radio unit.
10. Change the radio unit. See Replacing Radio Units and Replacing Remote Radio Units.
11. Unlock the changed radio unit.
12. Unlock the cells.
13. Wait 1 minute.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. Check statistics for the pmRadioCalibAttFail counter. Several previous calibration failures might indicate external radio disturbance in the TDD Guard Period. See Fault Management for more information about further actions to take before contacting next level of support.
15. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for RfPort

The Rf Reflected Power High alarm is raised when the

measured RF reflected power in the radio unit exceeds a predefined threshold. The

possible causes are the following:

- Problems in the antenna cable or in the RF connector.
- The transmitted frequency in the radio does not match the TX frequency band of the TMA.

The RF branch shuts down which results in loss of service on that RF branch.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.

If there is a TMA, do the following:

2. Check if there is a frequency mismatch between the cell and the TMA. The frequency band of the TMA is stored in TmaSubUnit.iuantTmaSubunitFreqRangeTx, and the frequency band of the cell is stored in EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl.

If mismatch is found, do the following:

3. Make sure that the EUtranCellFDD.earfcndl is configured correctly.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Send a technician to site.
5. Replace the TMA.

If the frequency of the TMA and the cell matches, do the following:

6. Check that the RfPort and RfBranch MOs are correctly configured, and reconfigure them if necessary. See Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the configuration is changed, do the following:

7. Restart the DU.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Restart the radio unit.
9. Wait at least 30 minutes. It can take up to 30 minutes for the alarm to reappear.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

10. Send a technician to site.
11. Check that the feeder is connected properly to the antenna, and that there is no short circuit in the feeder and antenna system. See Feeder System Guideline.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

12. Check the following:
    - There is no water in the feeder.
    - There is no snow covering the antenna.
    - There is no corrosion on the antenna cable connectors.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

13. Replace the faulty antenna cable. See Replacing Antenna System Units in the RBS Site Products library.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
