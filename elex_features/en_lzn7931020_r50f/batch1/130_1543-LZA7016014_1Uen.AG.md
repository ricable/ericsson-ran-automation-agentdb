# 2 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: NTP server signals Incorrect Stratum Level or NTP Server signals Incorrect Leap Indicator value

The NTP server is not locked to a valid synchronization source. If the NTP

server signals Incorrect Stratum Level appears, the NTP server is signaling

that the stratum Level is not equal to 1. If the NTP server signals Incorrect

Leap Indicator value appears ,the NTP is signaling that the leap indicator

value is not acceptable.

If no synchronization reference is available, the fault might stop or disturb Network

Synchronization.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the following conditions are met:

- The Network Synchronization Plan is available.
- The Transmission Plan is available.

Steps

1. Wait for at least 5 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit the procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

2. Ensure that the NTP server is configured according to the Network Synchronization Plan and the Transmission Plan.
3. Wait for at least 5 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.
4. If the alarm remains, consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Actions for RadioEquipmentClockReference: High NTP packet drop towards NTP server

The number of NTP

response packets received from the NTP server is lower than expected. The possible cause is

a problem in the external IP network or the NTP server has a capacity problem. If no

synchronization reference is available, the fault might stop or disturb Network

Synchronization.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the following conditions are met:

- The Network Synchronization Plan is available.
- The Transmission Plan is available.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the transport network is configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
3. Wait for at least 20 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Ensure that the QoS setting is correct, and DSCP value is configured in the NTP MO (including QoS setting in the transport network and NTP server).
5. Wait for at least 20 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Actions for RadioEquipmentClockReference: High PTP packet drop towards PTP Grandmaster

The number of PTP messages received from PTP Grandmaster is lower than expected because of

an external IP network problem. If no synchronization reference is available, the fault

might stop or disturb Network Synchronization.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the following conditions are met:

- The Network Synchronization Plan is available.
- The Transmission Plan is available.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the transport network is configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
3. Wait for at least 20 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Ensure that Quality of Service (QoS) setting is correct, and DSCP value is configured in the PtpBcOcPort MO (including QoS setting in the transport network and PTP Grandmaster).
5. Wait for at least 20 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Actions for RadioEquipmentClockReference: Unsupported clock class received from PTP Grandmaster

The clock class value announced by PTP Grandmaster is not acceptable because the PTP

Grandmaster is not locked to a valid synchronization source.  If no synchronization

reference is available, the fault might stop or disturb Network Synchronization.

Prerequisites

Before starting this procedure, ensure that the following conditions are met:

- The Network Synchronization Plan is available.
- The Transmission Plan is available.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the PTP Grandmaster is configured according to ITU-T G.8265.1.
3. Wait for at least 5 minutes. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
