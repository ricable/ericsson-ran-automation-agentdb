# 1 Overview of Replacing Baseband Using ENM

There are several user guides available for the expansion, migration, and replacement of

Baseband Radio Nodes. To find the correct user guide for these use cases, see Baseband Expansion, Migration, and Replacement User

Guides Overview.

Hardware replace using ENM is performed when replacement of a Baseband Radio Node

is required. A physical board (or the main processor board) in a node can be replaced

with a new one, without losing the configuration data.

Hardware replace is an automated configuration process, initiated through an Auto

Provisioning project using ENM CLI or the Auto Provisioning UI. The configuration files

and the License Key File (LKF) from the old Baseband unit are automatically transferred

to the new Baseband unit by restoring from a node backup.

The estimated duration for the end-to-end scenario is 35 minutes.

## 1.1 Prerequisites of Replacing Baseband Using ENM

- A request for replacing a Baseband unit is done as a decision activity.

Software-related and system prerequisites

- ENM version 20.4 or later.
- Access to ENM CLI or the Auto Provisioning UI.
- Auto provisioning projects for the network element that is to be replaced are removed from ENM AP.

Hardware-related prerequisites

- The new Baseband unit must be the same model as the replaced Baseband unit.
- The serial number of the Baseband unit must be correct when entered in the system. If not, a rollback procedure is required.

# 2 Methods of Replacing Baseband Using ENM

Replacing a Baseband unit is done with one of the following methods.

Table 1

| Method                   | Benefits                                                                                                  | Limitations                                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero Touch (recommended) | Reduces the amount of on-site activities     Laptop is not required     No need to bring SIF file to site | DHCP and DNS infrastructure is required                  |
| LMT                      | DHCP is not required                                                                                      | Laptop is required     SIF file must be uploaded on-site |

A node hardware replace is executed by ordering a hardware replace project through the

ENM CLI.

The command triggers the hardware replacement flow and reconfigures the existing ENM node

identity with a new hardware serial number from the latest known configuration available

in ENM.

The hardware replace command is ordered by dragging and dropping the hardware replace

project ZIP file into the ENM CLI.

The procedure is applicable for the following hardware:

- Baseband Radio Nodes (LTE/WCDMA/GSM/Multistandard Mixed Mode)

For more information, see Auto Provisioning in the ENM Online

Help.

## 2.1 End-to-End Workflow of Replacing Baseband Using ENM

The figure below describes the end-to-end workflow of the replace Baseband unit procedure using ENM.

# 3 Configuration of Baseband Radio Node

![Image](../images/114_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.BA/additional_3_CP.png)

The following steps are performed by the ENM Operator off-site.

In the configuration phase, node-specific configuration files are created and the

Baseband Radio Node replacement is ordered. The configuration phase includes the

following tasks:

- Create a Replacement Project File.
- Order the Replacement.

Tools

- ENM
- ZIP file builder
- XML Validator

## 3.1 Replacement Project File

A replacement project file is a ZIP file that contains the required configurations. The

file is imported into the ENM CLI or the Auto Provisioning UI to trigger the

replacement.

An example of the replacement project file structure is shown

below.

```
[replaceExample.zip]
├── projectInfo.xml
└── replaceNode1
    └── nodeInfo.xml
```

For more information about creating a replacement project, see the Auto Provisioning in

ENM online help.

### 3.1.1 Create a Project Folder and a Project Information File

Sample Project Information Files are available using the

ap download -x command in ENM CLI, or in

Baseband Radio Node library

&gt; Initial Configuration

.

Steps

1. Create an empty project folder.
2. Create a new projectInfo.xml file within the empty project folder, or use a sample Project Information File.
3. Update the template projectInfo.xml file according to the specific replacement project: Project name Description Creator

Example 1   projectInfo.xml Example File

```
<projectInfoxmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ProjectInfo.xsd"><name>RadioNode_20Q4_HwReplace_LMT_User_1_proj1</name><description>Example of hardware replace project with LTE RadioNode nodes</description><creator>Ericsson</creator></projectInfo>
```

### 3.1.2 Create a Node Folder with a Node Information File

The node folder stores node-specific configuration within the project. It is

recommended to name the subfolder the same as the Logical Name of the node. Node

folders must be at the same level as the Project Information File.

Steps

1. Create a node folder for each node that is to be replaced. Place each folder in the project folder created in Create a Project Folder and a Project Information File.
2. Create a Node Information File called nodeInfo.xml in each node folder. The file connects to the appropriate schema located in Baseband Radio Node library &gt; Initial Configuration . The schema can be downloaded from ENM using the ap download command. For more information about specific configuration, see ENM Online Help.

Example 2   nodeInfo.xml Example File

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><nodeInfoxmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="HardwareReplaceNodeInfo.xsd"><name>Node-001</name><hardwareSerialNumber>SCB87654321</hardwareSerialNumber># Optional in hardware replace with Zero Touch<backup>backup.pkg.name</backup># Optional<defaultRouter>192.168.0.99</defaultRouter># Optional<security># Optional, only needed if subjectAltName differs in the new unit<ipSecurity><subjectAltName>123456789X.OperatorName.SE</subjectAltName># Mandatory within security tag<subjectName>1.2.3.4.a.b</subjectName># Optional</ipSecurity></security></nodeInfo>
```

#### 3.1.2.1 &lt;subjectAltName&gt; When Based on Hardware Serial Number

Including the &lt;subjectAltName&gt; in the nodeInfo.xml

file updates the &lt;subjectAltName&gt; of a node when executing a hardware

replace. The IPSec node credentials are updated to reflect the new

&lt;subjectAltName&gt;.

### 3.1.3 Create the Project ZIP File

Steps

1. Select all the contents of the project folder.
2. Create new ZIP file. Note: The Project Information File and all node folders must be located in the root folder of the project ZIP file.

# 4 Replace Baseband Unit Using Zero Touch

## 4.1 Prerequisites for Replacement of the Baseband Unit Using Zero Touch
