# 2 Remedy Action for EUtranCellFDD: Shortage of LTE AAS FDD Channel Bandwidth 10 MHz (CXC 401 2217)

This remedy action is valid for the following channel bandwidth capacities:

Table 2   Channel Bandwidth Capacities - FDD

| Capacity Name                        | Capacity Key   | Product Number   | Valid For          | Valid For               |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Capacity Name                        | Capacity Key   | Product Number   | Hardware Units     | Radio Access Technology |
| LTE AAS FDD Channel Bandwidth 10 MHz | CXC 401 2217   | FAK 101 0125     | AIR supporting AAS | LTE                     |

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the cell.
3. Ensure that the necessary level of LTE AAS FDD Channel Bandwidth 10 MHz HWAC is available for the requested configuration by checking the CapacityState.currentCapacityLimit attribute of the corresponding MO instance. The value of the attribute must be compared with the sum of all EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth for the cells referring to the SectorCarrier MO instances using AAS-capable sectors.

# 18 Remedy Action for NRSectorCarrier: Shortage of NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Licenses (CXC 401 2291)

## 18.1 Remedy Action for Shortage of NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Licenses (CXC 401 2291) With Installing Additional Capacity Units

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the CapacityState.currentCapacityLimit and the CapacityState.grantedCapacityLevel MO attributes to see if the necessary amount of NR 25+25 MHz sector carrier licenses are available for the requested configuration. The CapacityState.currentCapacityLimit attribute shows the installed capacity licenses, and the CapacityState.grantedCapacityLevel attribute indicates the number of granted capacity licenses. The required capacity is the sum of the bandwidth of the NRSectorCarrier MOs that refer to NR 25+25 MHz sector carriers. When TDD is used, the NRSectorCarrier bandwidth is found in the NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL and NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL attributes. When FDD is used, the NRSectorCarrier bandwidth is the sum of the values of the NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL and NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL attributes.
3. If there are not enough capacity licenses available for the requested configuration, install an LKF that enables the sufficient number of capacity units. Note: When using the Instantaneous Licensing feature, see License Additional Capacity Resources Request Failed. When additional license capacity is added, the system automatically tries to activate the sector carriers that failed to unlock because of license shortage. For more information, see NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier.
