Radio interface (RI) and TN port remapping is required for migration between the

following RAN Compute units:

| Baseband 6648 or RAN Processor 6651          | RAN Processor 6672 or RAN Processor 6655   |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Baseband 6641 or RAN Processor 6647          | RAN Processor 6672 or RAN Processor 6655   |
| Radio Processor 6347 or Radio Processor 6353 | Radio Processor 6372                       |

For details on port remapping and migration scenarios to RAN Compute group 6 see Migration Scenarios to RAN Compute Group 6.

## 1.1 Migration Limitations

The following must be considered before starting the migration:

- Migration is only supported from one old RAN Compute unit to one new RAN Compute unit. No support for migrating multiple old RAN Compute units.
- The same radio configuration is used before and after migration.
- No expansion or change of configuration during migration.

The following must be considered for the LMT migration method:

- The Site Installation file can only be generated by the ENM AP hardware replace flow when the OAM interface (InterfaceIPv4/InterfaceIPv6) references a VlanPort. For more information on supporting all options available for the LMT migration method, see the Auto Provisioning document in the ENM Online Help library.

The following must be considered for the on-site migration method:

- For RAN Compute units using IPsec with certificates where subjectAltName (SAN) MO contains the node serial number, a manual update must be done. For more information about the manual steps for handling SAN, see Serial Number Used in Subject Alternative Name of Certificates for IPsec.

## 1.2 Migration Phases

RAN Compute units can be migrated using one of the following methods:

| Zero Touch migration                       |    | Zero Touch migration requires the least on-site activity. The node can be                         powered on and the migration can be monitored with just the optical                         indicators. The migration can also be monitored using ENM Auto Provisioning.                         Zero Touch integration requires a DHCP server or a relay agent in the                         transport infrastructure as a prerequisite. At Zero Touch migration the node                         obtains its configuration (backup, upgrade package, LKF) from ENM.   |

| Local Maintenance Terminal (LMT) migration |    | LMT migration requires a client device to be physically connected to the node                         during the migration process. LMT migration can be monitored using a client                         with a web browser through the Autointegration Web GUI, using a mobile                         device with the Ericsson Site Assistant application, or using ENM Auto                         Provisioning.  At LMT migration the node obtains its configuration (backup,                         upgrade package, LKF) from ENM.                                |
|                                            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| On-site migration                          |    | For on-site migration, every step of the migration process can be performed                         on-site. The necessary integration files (RBS Summary Restore File, backup,                         upgrade package and LKF) are stored locally on a client device which is                         connected to the LMT port of the target RAN Compute unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# 2 Early Preparation

## 2.1 Plan Migration

Plan the migration by going through the following:

- Secure that the required hardware is ordered.
- Identify the site to be migrated, if new or changed hardware and software configurations are needed.
- Make sure that a commercial agreement is in place for the needed licenses.
- Decide which integration method to use: Zero Touch, LMT or on-site.

License Handling

The new RAN Compute unit requires a new separate License Key File (LKF). The LKF for

migration is requested and installed in one of the following ways:

| Manual Licensing                              |    | A request is sent to the Ericsson Customer Unit (CU). The generated file                             is manually imported to ENM and used in the migration. The request must                             be sent in advance, as the LKF must be available in ENM before the                             migration starts. For more information, see Prerequisites for Requesting a New License Key File Manually and Request and Import License Key File to ENM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

help.

## 2.2 Prepare Node Software

Prerequisites

- The Upgrade Package (UP) for the new RAN Compute unit is downloaded from the Ericsson Software Gateway and stored in ENM. The ENM Node Health Check Application and the ENM Auto Provisioning Configuration Generator both rely on the UP available in the ENM Software and Hardware Manager. If node health checks are defined for migration, or if the node profile created in ENM Auto Provisioning, the relevant UP must be imported before the migration. For more information on Upgrade Packages, see Manage Software. Table 3 Supported UP/Software Product CXP New RAN Compute Unit CXP 201 0174/2 (CPRI/eCPRI software)
- For LMT and on-site integration methods, ensure that a client is available.

Steps

1. Launch ENM and go to Software and Hardware Manager &gt; Software Administration .
2. Use Import Software Package to import the downloaded UP file to ENM.

### 2.2.1 Download Upgrade Package to Client

This task is only applicable to on-site migration.

Steps

1. Download the Upgrade Package for the new RAN Compute unit from the Ericsson Software Gateway to the LMT client. Table 4 Supported UP/Software Product CXP New RAN Compute Unit CXP 201 0174/2 (CPRI/eCPRI software)

## 2.3 Define Node Health Check Profile

This task is optional.

The health check profile is created in ENM NHC application. For instructions on how to

create it, see ENM online help → Node Health Check.

For more details on the health check rules, see the chapter Health Check Rules and

Categories in Manage Node Health Check.

# 3 Preparation

## 3.1 Prepare Node Hardware

### 3.1.1 Confirm Network Loader Software Version

It is recommended to check the Network Loader software version before starting the

migration of a new RAN Compute unit.

This task is optional.

Steps

1. Check the revision of the hardware unit against the table in Upgrade Network Loader to determine the Network Loader version.
2. Upgrade the Network Loader by following the instructions in Upgrade Network Loader, if the revision is lower than required.

### 3.1.2 Confirm and Reset Hardware Integration State

The new RAN Compute unit must be in initial state, also called integration state,

when powered up for migration.

If the new RAN Compute unit has been used before, make sure to confirm that the unit

is in integration state. This is done off site as a preparation before the

integration of the new RAN Compute unit on site.

Steps

1. Connect and power up the new RAN Compute unit.
2. Connect a client to the LMT port on the node. For instructions on how to connect a laptop or a mobile device to the new RAN Compute unit, see Connect Client.
3. Launch a web browser and connect to the Emergency Access GUI. For instructions, see Connect Client.
4. Make sure that the Node Status is Node is working in the Emergency Access GUI.
5. Click on the Board Restore button in the Emergency AccessGUI. If the Emergency Access GUI does not have a Board Restore button, that means the unit is equipped with a physical Board Restore button. Press the Board Restore button with a thin pin or needle for more than 8 seconds. Wait until the unit is restarted and the Operational optical indicator is flashing at 0.5 Hz, before releasing the button.

## 3.2 Prerequisites for Requesting a New License Key File Manually

If manual licensing is used, a new LKF must be requested manually. This requires the

following conditions to be fulfilled:

- User must be authorized to handle LKFs.
- This must be done three days before the migration.

For the appropriate capacity key and product number to order in the LKF, see Hardware-Related Capabilities.

## 3.3 Request and Import License Key File to ENM

If manual licensing is used, the License Key File (LKF) required for the migration is

requested and obtained as a part of the preparation activities.

This procedure applies to the manual licensing method. If Instantaneous Licensing in

connected mode is used, the node automatically requests an update of the LKF, and

there is no need to request an LKF in SHM. If Instantaneous Licensing in

non-connected mode is used, old LKF generated for previously used hardware can be

used for seven days through License System Triggered Unlock after

completed migration. An alarm automatically indicates the activation of

License System Triggered Unlock and the need to run

Generate Radio Node License Request File in ENM Flow

Automation, to generate required LRF. The LRF must then be submitted to the SSP-LKF

Portal to generate an LKF for the target node. The LKF must be imported and

installed manually.

For more information on the licensing methods, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.

For detailed descriptions of the import functionality and the installation wizard,

see the Install Licenses Key Files tutorial in ENM Online

Help.

Limitations

- The LKF for the old Baseband unit cannot be applied to the new RAN Compute unit.
- The LKF for the new RAN Compute unit cannot be applied to the old Baseband unit.

Prerequisites

- The new LKF must contain HWACs and features supported by the new RAN Compute unit.
- Fingerprint in the new LKF must match the fingerprint of the old Baseband unit. It is assumed that the Baseband unit name and fingerprint values are kept at migration.

Steps

1. Contact Ericsson CU to request and receive the License Key Files.
2. Log on to ENM.
3. Open Software and Hardware Manager &gt; License Administration .
4. Import the License Key File using Import Key Files.

### 3.3.1 Copy License Key File to Client

This task is only applicable for on-site migration.

Prerequisites

- The new License Key File (LKF) is received from Ericsson CU.

Steps

1. Copy the new LKF to the LMT client.

## 3.4 Prepare User Accounts

ENM and node accounts must be prepared before the migration.

Consider the security risks when handling the migration user account, as the

migration user requires access to the full node configuration and possibly to

several radio nodes. It is recommended to use Target Based Access Control (TBAC) as

an addition to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and remove the user when migration

is completed.

For more information, see the ENM Identity and Access Management System

Administrator Guide in the Ericsson Network Manager CPI

library.

Prerequisites

Steps

1. Create an ENM account with the following administrative rights: Cmedit\_Administrator FM\_Administrator SHM\_Administrator NodeSecurity\_Administrator NHC\_Administrator Cell\_Management\_Administrator AutoProvisioning\_Administrator or AutoProvisioning\_Operator
2. Optional: If the LMT or on-site migration method is used, create the FIELD\_TECHNICIAN role in ENM.
3. Create a node account with the following COM role for the new RAN Compute unit: SystemReadOnly

## 3.5 Create an RBS Summary Restore File

This task is only applicable for on-site migration.

To create the RBS Summary Restore file manually, use the example file RBS Summary Restore Node File, Example and specify the

necessary details.

Steps

1. Save the following files onto the local file system: New LKF, if manual licensing is used. The node backup, as a ZIP file, as downloaded. The Upgrade Package, extracted from the ZIP file after the download.
2. Open the example file using an XML editor.
3. Replace the placeholder information in the for the appropriate file paths: Placeholder Text Information to Insert %Backup File Path% The file path of the compressed node backup file. %UP File Path% The file path of the extracted Upgrade Package.
4. Save the RBS Summary Restore File to the laptop.

## 3.6 Store RAN Compute Unit Information

Before migration some information from the old RAN Compute unit must be written down.

This information is needed later for unlocking cells, and potentially for

rollback.

Steps

1. Write down the serial number of the OAM and IPsec certificates (if ENM CA for IPsec).
2. Write down the list of cells that were locked in Lock Cells.
3. Write down the list of maintenance user and their passwords. Use the following command to list the maintenance users: secadm credentials get --nodelist %NODENAME% Result: The maintenance users for the node are presented.

## 3.7 Run Health Check on Old RAN Compute Unit

It is recommended to run a health check in the ENM NHC application to ensure that the

old RAN Compute unit is healthy.

This task is optional.

Run a health check in the ENM NHC application to ensure that the old RAN Compute unit is

healthy. For instructions on how to set up and run a health check, see Ericsson

Network Manager CPI → ENM Operators Guide.

The recommended category setting is SITE\_ACCEPTANCE. Errors detected during the health

check must be corrected before the migration continues. For more information on health

check categories and rules, see Manage Node Health Check.

## 3.8 Create Project File

This task is applicable for Zero Touch and LMT migration only.

A project file is a ZIP file that contains the required configurations for the ENM Auto

Provisioning hardware replacement flow. The file is imported into the ENM CLI or the

Auto Provisioning UI to trigger the replacement.

An example of the project file structure is shown below.

```
[migrationExample.zip]
├── projectInfo.xml
└── replaceNode1
    └── nodeInfo.xml
```

For more information about creating a replacement project, see the Auto Provisioning in

ENM online help.

### 3.8.1 Create a Project Folder and Project Information File

Steps

1. Create an empty project folder.
2. Create a new projectInfo.xml file within the empty project folder, or use a sample Project Information File.
3. Update the template projectInfo.xml file according to the specific replacement project: Project name Description Creator

### 3.8.2 Create a Node Folder with a Node Information File

The node folder stores node-specific configuration within the project. It is

recommended to name the subfolder the same as the Logical Name of the node. Node

folders must be at the same level as the Project Information File.

Steps

1. Create a node folder for each node that is to be replaced. Place each folder in the project folder created in Create a Project Folder and Project Information File.
2. Create a Node Information File called nodeInfo.xml in each node folder.

Example 1   nodeInfo.xml Example File

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><nodeInfoxmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="HardwareReplaceNodeInfo.xsd"><name>Node-001</name><hardwareSerialNumber>SCB87654321</hardwareSerialNumber># Mandatory for Zero Touch migration<backup>backup.pkg.name</backup># Optional<defaultRouter>192.168.0.99</defaultRouter># Optional<security># Optional, only needed if subjectAltName differs in the new unit<ipSecurity><subjectAltName>123456789X.OperatorName.SE</subjectAltName># Mandatory within security tag<subjectName>1.2.3.4.a.b</subjectName># Optional</ipSecurity></security></nodeInfo>
```

For more information about the node information file, see the ENM Online

Help library.

#### 3.8.2.1 &lt;subjectAltName&gt; When Based on Hardware Serial Number

Including the &lt;subjectAltName&gt; in the nodeInfo.xml

file updates the &lt;subjectAltName&gt; of a node when executing a hardware

replace. The IPSec node credentials are updated to reflect the new

&lt;subjectAltName&gt;.

### 3.8.3 Create the Project ZIP File

Steps

1. Select all the contents of the project folder.
2. Create new ZIP file. Note: The Project Information File and all node folders must be located in the root folder of the project ZIP file.

## 3.9 Add Node IP to DHCP Server

Ericsson Network Manager CPI → ENM Configuration Troubleshooting

Guide.

## 7.1 Check Migration Status

The migration status can be checked in ENM CLI or AMOS.

Steps

1. Check the SwMSupport.migrationStatus attribute for information on migration status. The attribute has the following possible values: NO\_MIGRATION MIGRATION\_SUCCESSFUL MIGRATION\_FAILED NOT\_SUPPORTED\_COMBINATION

# 8 Rollback

If the migration fails and the faults cannot be resolved, use the rollback procedure

to restore the old RAN Compute unit.

It can be necessary to revoke the certificates for the new RAN Compute unit in case a

permanent rollback to the old RAN Compute unit is desired. For more information, see

Revoke Certificates.

The LKF stored on the old RAN Compute unit is still valid and is used after

successful rollback. The LKF for the new RAN Compute unit in ENM must not be applied

to the old RAN Compute unit. In case a permanent rollback is required, a new node

LKF must be ordered and loaded into ENM.

Prerequisites

- Information of the old RAN Compute unit, noted down from the preparation phase. See, Store RAN Compute Unit Information.
- The same old RAN Compute unit must be used at rollback as was used before the new RAN Compute unit migration.

Steps

1. Collect the node logs from the unsuccessfully integrated RAN Compute unit using one of the following methods: From ENM, if the node integration was partly successful. From Auto Integration Web GUI using LMT, if there is no access to the node from ENM.
2. Inform the Site Technician that a rollback to the old RAN Compute unit needs to be performed on site.
3. Send the logs to local support organization, according to the normal support procedure.
4. Remove the new RAN Compute unit.
5. Insert the old RAN Compute unit and reconnect all equipment in the same way as it was before the migration. Note: Do not perform a factory reset on the old RAN Compute unit.
6. Reissue certificate using following command: secadm certificate reissue -ct OAM --nodelist %NODENAME% Result: The following message will be displayed: Successfully started a job to reissue certificates for nodes.
7. Check the management state with the following command: cmedit get NetworkElement=%NODENAME% Note: The Network Element managementState attribute must be set to NORMAL. Result: The node data for the selected node is presented with the managementState attribute.
8. Check the list of maintenance users.
    1. List the maintenance users with the following command: secadm credentials get --nodelist %NODENAME% Result: The maintenance users for the node are presented.
    2. If the maintenance users changed from the original RAN Compute unit, they must be reset to their original values, see Store RAN Compute Unit Information. To create new credentials, use the following command: secadm credentials create --secureusername &lt;username&gt; --secureuserpassword &lt;password&gt; --nodelist %NODENAME% Result: The maintenance user credentials for the node are created.
9. Unlock the cells. For more information, see Unlock Cells.
10. Enable ME handling in ENM. For more information, see Enable ME Handling in ENM.

## 9.2 Serial Number Used in Subject Alternative Name of Certificates for IPsec

This procedure is only applicable for on-site integration.

This procedure is only applicable when serial number is used in the

subjectAltName (SAN) of the certificates used for IPsec.

Assuming online enrollment is used, the new RAN Compute unit automatically enrolls a

new certificate using the old SAN. The certificate is used temporarily by the new

RAN Compute unit until the certificate replacement procedure is performed.

When serial number is used in the certificate for IPsec of the node, these steps must

be performed.

Steps

1. Update the CA (ENM or external) with a new certificate for IPsec, containing the serial number of the new RAN Compute unit.
2. If a whitelist is used, based on serial number: update the Security Gateway (SEGW) with the serial number of the new RAN Compute unit.
3. Update the IPsec NodeCredential of the node, by configuring the subjectAltName with a new value matching the new serial number of the RAN Compute unit.
4. Start the online enrollment of the IPsec NodeCredential by using the startOnlineEnrollment action.
5. Remove the old serial number from the whitelist.
