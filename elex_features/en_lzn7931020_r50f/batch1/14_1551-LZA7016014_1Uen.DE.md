Figure 1   Baseband Radio Node Function

## 1.2 Node Functions

Node functions are divided into the following main parts:

- Management and control
- User plane

Management and control include functions for both traffic control and O&amp;M.

User plane functions include transport, baseband, and radio processing.

The support system includes functions for power supply, climate control, and external alarms

and is common for all radio nodes within a cabinet or enclosure.

### 1.2.1 NR Node Functionality

For NR, the implementation of the 3GPP-defined logical node is the gNodeB. The gNodeB logical node

functions are realized in the following deployments:

- Standalone Deployment
- EN-DC Deployment

The gNodeB can implement its logical node functions of both

deployments simultaneously. This means that a gNodeB can support

both NR-capable UEs and EN-DC-capable UEs in the same NR cell at the same time.

#### 1.2.1.1 NR Node Functionality in Standalone Deployment

For NR, the implementation of the 3GPP-defined logical node is the gNodeB. The gNodeB provides user and control plane terminations for the

NR-capable UE.

The gNodeB is connected to the 5G Core Network (5GC) through the

NG interface. The NG-C interface connects the gNodeB with the

Access and Mobility Function (AMF) of the 5GC for control plane signaling termination.

The NG-U interface connects the gNodeB with the User Plane

Function (UPF) of the 5GC for user plane traffic termination. The interconnection of gNodeBs is managed over the Xn interface. The Xn-C interface is

for inter-gNodeB control plane signaling. The Xn-U interface is

for inter-gNodeB user plane traffic termination.

The gNodeB is managed by ENM using the Mu O&amp;M interface.

The architecture of the gNodeB separates the following logical

node functions connected to each other:

- One Central Unit (CU) which is further separated into the following logical functions: One Control Plane function (gNodeB-CU-CP) One User Plane function (gNodeB-CU-UP)
- One Distributed Unit (DU)

The

Central Unit controls the operation of the Distributed

Unit. The Central Unit and the connected Distributed Unit are visible to other gNodeBs and the 5GC as a gNodeB

entity.

Figure 2   Overall Architecture for Separation of NR Node Functions in Standalone Deployment

##### 1.2.1.1.1 Central Unit Control Plane of the gNodeB in Standalone Deployment

The Control Plane function (gNodeB-CU-CP) is one of the separate logical functions of the

Central Unit (CU) in the gNodeB. It terminates the Xn-C

interface to neighboring gNodeBs, and the NG-C interface to the

Access and Mobility Function (AMF) of the 5GC. It hosts the RRC and the control plane of

the PDCP protocols of the Central Unit. The control plane protocols are used for the

following functions:

- Controlling the PDU sessions
- Managing the connection between the UE and the network

The Control Plane function is connected to the User Plane function (gNodeB-CU-UP) of the

Central Unit and the Distributed Unit (DU). The connection between the User Plane

function of the Central Unit and the Distributed Unit is established by the Control

Plane function using bearer context management. The Control Plane function selects the

User Plane function to provide the requested services to

the UE.

##### 1.2.1.1.2 Central Unit User Plane of the gNodeB in Standalone Deployment

The User Plane function (gNodeB-CU-UP) is one of the separate logical functions of the

Central Unit (CU) of the gNodeB. It terminates the Xn-U

interface to neighboring gNodeBs, and the NG-U interface to the

User Plane Function (UPF) of the 5GC. It hosts the user plane of the PDCP and the SDAP

protocols of the Central Unit. The user plane protocols are used for the implementation

of the PDU session service.

The User Plane function is connected to the Control Plane function (gNodeB-CU-CP) of the

Central Unit and the Distributed Unit

(DU).

##### 1.2.1.1.3 Distributed Unit of the gNodeB in Standalone Deployment

The Distributed Unit (DU) is the logical node function of the gNodeB hosting the following protocols:

- RLC
- MAC
- PHY

The Distributed Unit is connected with the UE through the NR Uu interface. Its

operation is partly controlled by the Central Unit (CU). One Distributed Unit supports

one or multiple cells, whereas once cell is supported by only one Distributed Unit.

The Distributed Unit is connected to the Control Plane (gNodeB-CU-CP) and the User Plane

(gNodeB-CU-UP) functions of the Central Unit (CU) in the gNodeB.

1.2.1.1NR Node Functionality in Standalone Deployment

#### 1.2.1.2 NR Node Functionality in EN-DC Deployment

For NR, the implementation of the 3GPP-defined logical node is the gNodeB. In the EN-DC deployment, the gNodeB is connected to the eNodeB which

represents the LTE logical node functionality. The gNodeB, in

the EN-DC deployment, provides user plane termination for the EN-DC-capable UE. Control

plane management is handled by the eNodeB.

In the EN-DC deployment, the gNodeB is connected to the EPC

through the S1 interface. The S1-U interface connects the gNodeB

with the SGW of the EPC for user plane traffic termination. The interconnection of gNodeBs with eNodeBs is managed over

the X2 interface. The X2-C interface is for control plane signaling between the gNodeB and the eNodeB. The X2-U

interface is for user plane traffic between the gNodeB and the

eNodeB.

In the EN-DC deployment, both the gNodeB and eNodeB are managed by ENM using the Mu O&amp;M interface.

The architecture of the gNodeB separates the following logical

node functions connected to each other:

- One Central Unit which is further separated into the following logical functions: One gNodeB-CU-CP One gNodeB-CU-UP
- One Distributed Unit

The

Central Unit controls the operation of the Distributed

Unit. The Central Unit and the connected Distributed Unit are visible to neighboring

connected eNodeBs and the EPC as a gNodeB entity.

Figure 3   Overall Architecture for Separation of NR Node Functions in EN-DC

Deployment

##### 1.2.1.2.1 Central Unit Control Plane of the gNodeB in EN-DC Deployment

The gNodeB-CU-CP is one of the separate logical functions of the Central Unit in the gNodeB. In the EN-DC deployment, it terminates the X2-C

interface to neighboring connected eNodeBs. It hosts the RRC

and the control plane of the PDCP protocols of the Central Unit. The control plane

protocols are used for the following functions:

- Controlling the user plane termination
- Managing the connection between the UE and the network

The Control Plane function is connected to the gNodeB-CU-UP of the Central Unit and the

Distributed Unit. The connection between the User Plane function of the Central Unit and

the Distributed Unit is established by the Control Plane function using bearer context

management. The Control Plane function selects the User Plane

function to provide the requested services to the UE.

##### 1.2.1.2.2 Central Unit User Plane of the gNodeB in EN-DC Deployment

The gNodeB-CU-UP is one of the separate logical functions of the Central Unit in the gNodeB. It terminates the X2-U interface to neighboring

connected eNodeBs, and the S1-U interface to the SGW of the

EPC. It hosts the user plane of the PDCP protocol of the Central

Unit.

The User Plane function is connected to the gNodeB-CU-CP of the Central Unit and the

Distributed

Unit.

- MAC
- PHY

The Distributed Unit is connected with the UE through the NR Uu interface. Its

operation is partly controlled by the Central Unit. One Distributed Unit supports one or

multiple cells, whereas once cell is supported by only one Distributed Unit.

The Distributed Unit is connected to the gNodeB-CU-CP and the gNodeB-CU-UP functions of

the Central Unit in the gNodeB.

## 1.3 Multi Standard

Multi Standard (MS) means that the radio node operates as the following 3GPP-defined logical

nodes:

- gNodeB
- eNodeB
- NodeB
- BTS

For MS, the same Upgrade Package (UP) and HW is used.

The purpose with MS is to share software resources as integration, configuration, and

Operation and Maintenance, in addition to sharing physical resources, which enables shared

Support System Units (cabinet, alarm, power and climate) and radio units.

The multicabinet control feature gives the possibility to have large and flexible

configurations that can span over multiple cabinets.

# 2 Hardware

The hardware consists of Baseband units, radio units, and Support System.

Figure 7   Main Hardware in the Radio Node

## 2.1 Baseband Unit

Baseband units provide the following functions and resources:

- The transport network termination based on IP, allowing a multitude of transport physical layers
- Baseband-Radio Interface termination
- Baseband processing for control plane and user plane
- Timing Unit for synchronization
- Main Processor managing all node software and configuration databases
- The processing environment for functions including radio access control and O&amp;M

## 2.2 Radio Unit

Radio units provide the following functions and resources:

- Modulation and demodulation of baseband signals to various Radio Frequency (RF) bands
- RF power amplification and filtering

Radio unit types are

the following:

- Internal radio, which is installed in a cabinet with support system hardware
- External radio, which is a self-contained, outdoor unit installed close to the antennas
- Antenna Integrated Radio (AIR), in which the antenna system and the external radios in one sector are combined into one physical unit
- Micro RRU (mRRUS), which is a low-power external radio with either an integrated antenna, or an external antenna

## 2.3 Support System

The support system hardware includes the following functions and

resources:

- Mechanical environment for baseband units and radios
- Power supply and distribution
- Climate control
- Interfaces for external alarms

The support system is common for the nodes in a cabinet or an enclosure.

One of the nodes controls the support system and communicates all

relevant information to the secondary nodes. The secondary nodes report

temperature to the primary node.

In a multi-standard radio configuration with multiple RATs,

different node types share cabinet or enclosure, and support system.

Self-contained units, such as Baseband 6621, Baseband 6631, and RAN Processor

6651 that are equipped with a fan, do not need to be installed in a cabinet or

enclosure.

# 3 Software

This section describes the software management and software models in the node.

## 3.1 Software Management

The software is delivered, installed and activated by an upgrade package. In

addition to the software, the upgrade package contains integration files and

configuration files.

For more information about software handling, see Manage Software.

## 3.2 Managed Object Model

The Managed Object Model (MOM) is a software model of the resources in a node.

The MOM is applicable for NR, LTE, WCDMA, and GSM. In addition, GSM uses Abis

O&amp;M BTS Logical Model G31 for communication between the BSC and the BTS.

A Management Information Base (MIB) is an instance of the MOM of a particular node at

a particular time. The MIB represents the MOM configuration of the node. The MIB

provides information about status and configuration of the managed element, and is

used to configure and monitor resources.

The Managed Object Class (MOC) is the class representation of the configuration data

in a management interface. The Managed Object (MO) is the instance of a MOC.

A managed element is an O&amp;M logical node with one management interface including

a MOM variant. For more

information about the MOM, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

## 3.3 GSM Abis O&amp;M BTS Logical Model G31

The GSM O&amp;M part of the radio node consists of two managed object models:

- Abis O&amp;M BTS Logical Model G31 - referred to as Abis G31
- Managed Object Model (MOM) - common for all RATs

Abis G31 is used for communication between the BSC and the BTS.

Abis G31 model and the MOM are two separate models but have strong MO dependencies.

Figure 8   MOM and Abis G31 Model Dependencies

BtsFunction is the Top MO of the GSM branch in the MOM.

Abis G31 model consists of the following Managed Objects (MOs):

- Transceiver Group (TG)
- Sector Central Functions (SCF)
- Timing Function (TF)
- Abis Transport (AT)
- Transceiver Controller (TRXC)
- Transmitter (TX)
- Time Slot (TS)
- Receiver (RX)

The GsmSector MO in the MOM handles attributes corresponding to TG, SCF, TF and AT in

Abis G31.

The Trx MO in the MOM handles TRXC, TS, TX and RX.

The ExtTrx MO is a child of the Trx MO and it is

used for the GSM feature Combined Cell. For more information on this, see Manage Radio Network.

Each GSM Sector must have ONE corresponding Sector TG defined in BSC.

In BSC, the Sector TGs are independent of each other. The AbisIp MO needs to be defined

in each GSM sector to establish SCF OML connection to BSC.

When a TRX is created in the MOM, SCF corresponds to BSC, and a TRXC with subordinated

MO:s is automatically created in BSC.

When a TRX is unlocked in the radio node, a TRXC with subordinate MO:s is automatically

created in the radio node.

TRXC Operational Maintenance Link (OML) can be established when Trx is unlocked and BSC

has configured and enabled AT via Abis MO.

Once the TRXC OML is established, BSC starts TRXC, and configures and enables the

subordinate Abis MO:s.

For more information, see Manage GSM Abis Transport and Manage GSM Sector and TRX Handling.

# 4 Radio Node Sites

A radio node can be installed on one single site, or on several

sites, for example, one baseband site and several radio sites.

Site equipment includes products such as antenna systems, power

supplies and backup, enclosure and installation materials, site transmission,

shelters, solar panels, fuel cells, towers, and diesel generators.

Services for site solutions are available, for example, site acquisitions, civil works

installation,

and integration site development.

An example of a complete radio node site solution is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9   Radio Node Site Solution

## 4.1 Antenna System

The antenna system includes the following:

- Antennas
- Feeder cables
- RET units
- RET Interface Unit (RIU)
- TMA units

The feeder cables connect the radios to the antenna system. Feeder cables introduce delay and

attenuation of the radio signals. The delay and attenuation must be considered when planning

and configuring radio nodes.

A TMA placed close to the antenna amplifies the uplink signals from the antenna to compensate

for losses induced by the long feeder cable. TMAs improve the overall radio signal

sensitivity.

RET units, RIUs, and RET antennas provide the means to adjust the vertical angle of the RET

units, RIUs, and RET antennas provide the means to adjust the vertical angle of the antenna

lobe from a remote location. Changing the inclination of the antenna lobe affects the cell

range, the signal strength in the cell, and interference between cells. RET is a powerful tool

when tuning a system.

Radio nodes supervise the antenna system by monitoring Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) and

power consumption on the antenna ports, or reflected power measurement on the antenna ports.

The VSWR Antenna Supervision (FAJ 121 0706) and Return Loss Antenna Supervision (FAJ 121 4578)

features are used for the supervision of cables. The supervision only applies to transmit

branches. Power consumption applies to TMAs, RET units, and RIUs that are supplied by DC power

by RRUs and Radios through the feeders. RRUs and Radios monitor the DC current on the feeders

supplying the antenna equipment with DC power. Supervision can be turned on and off, and the

thresholds for generation of alarms can be adjusted. For the list of radios using reflected

power measurement for antenna supervision, see the following documents:

- Return Loss Antenna Supervision
- VSWR Antenna Supervision

AIR is a product where the antenna system and the radios for a sector are combined into one

physical unit. For mRRUS, the default configuration has embedded antennas, but there is also a

possibility to connect external antennas.

Massive MIMO comes with a new radio platform and a new interface between Baseband and the AIR

unit called eCPRI. The AIR unit supports an integrated active antenna with beamforming and

full dimension MIMO technology. The antenna consists of several antenna elements and a large

number of steerable ports and is capable to fully utilize radio resources in both horizontal

and vertical directions.

# 5 Operation and Maintenance

This section gives an overview of the configuration and integration

procedures, and operation and maintenance security.

## 5.1 Integration and Configuration

This section gives an overview of the initial configuration and

integration procedures. The node integration procedures are performed

accordingly:

- Network Provisioning - preparation of network infrastructure and network services
- Node Provisioning - preparation of configuration files from example files for node commissioning
- Node Commissioning - configuration and repositories storage of the configuration files
- Node Integration - integration of the node with LMT or Zero-touch procedures

### 5.1.1 Network Provisioning

The initial configuration of a node is managed with configuration files. The CPI

delivery include example files that can be used as templates for each

configuration.

### 5.1.2 Node Provisioning

During node provisioning, the configuration files are prepared

for node commissioning.

### 5.1.3 Node Commissioning

The initial configuration of a node is managed with configuration files.

For more information about initial configuration and configuration

files management, see Manage Configuration Files. For more information

about the Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT), see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool.

### 5.1.4 Node Integration

The integration of the node into the network takes place

during the last phase of the deployment. Depending on the deployment solution,

integration is zero touch (automatic integration at power-on) or requires manual

handling through a Local Maintenance Terminal (LMT). The following deployment

options exist:

- Zero touch integration
- Zero touch integration, off-site pre-configuration
- LMT integration
- LMT integration, on-site configuration

For more information on integration, see Integrate Baseband Radio Node and Integration Infrastructure Guidelines.

## 5.2 Element Management

Element Management functions in the node provide graphical user interfaces and

command line interfaces to end-users. The functionality can be accessed either

locally, from a Local Maintenance Terminal (LMT) connected to the node, or

remotely, for example, from

ENM.

Element Management Command Line Interface (EMCLI) provides

shell

commands for the

following functions:

- Status viewing
- Configuration management, operations on the Managed Objects (create and delete managed objects, set and get Managed Object data)
- Troubleshooting
- Software management
- Alarm management

## 5.3 Operation and Maintenance Security

All Operation and Maintenance interfaces are secured and users are authorized by username and

password, or certificates. For more information, see Manage User Access.
