# 1 Introduction

This instruction describes how to upgrade the Network Loader to the latest software version

using a laptop or a mobile device through the Autointegration

GUI.

The Autointegration GUI supports the following methods for file transfer:

- SFTP file trasfer
- HTTPS file upload

The Ericsson Site

Assistant Application

(ESA)

on a mobile device can also be used to upgrade the Network Loader. For more information, see

Ericsson Site Assistant Application.

For RAN Compute units

with

a USB port, the Network Loader can be upgraded

through

a USB memory stick.

The Network Loader is a software

that is

stored on the node during production. Network Loader is used to download

upgrade

packages,

configuration files, software, and to integrate the

node.

For

more information on Network Loader functions, seeIntegrate Baseband Radio Node.

Network Loader is also used for

the

emergency restore

procedure.

For more information, see

Emergency Restore Node from Backup on Site.

For information on how to access the node, see

Connect Client.

# 2 Network Loader Version

The Network Loader Type 2 is factory pre-installed on the boards. The Network Loader

version is upgraded with each new

revision

of the boards. The following software upgrades are supported:

- New configurations
- New features
- New hardware types

The feature levels, supported by the pre-installed Network Loader, are sorted by hardware

product and hardware revision. See Baseband Radio Node Hardware Revision for more

information.

The Network Loader version can be upgraded manually on an already installed board. To

upgrade to a later version, an Upgrade Package containing the Network Loader Type 3

software version is required. The chosen Upgrade Package revision must contain Network

Loader software supporting a sufficient integration feature level. See Network Loader Version by Baseband Radio Node Upgrade Package, and Procedure for more

information.

# 3 Procedure

## 3.1 Network Loader Limitations

The following boards and revisions have a limitation for the Network Loader:

- Baseband 5212, &lt;R10N
- Baseband 5216, &lt;R10N
- Baseband 6620, &lt;R3B
- Baseband 6303, &lt;R1G
- Baseband 6502, &lt;R1G
- Baseband 6318, &lt;R1E
- Baseband 6630, &lt;R3B
- IDU 5205

The limitation can cause load failure during integration when using software from

19.Q2/2.0 UP or later. In these cases, the Network Loader must be upgraded on these

boards when integration is performed.

The packed Upgrade Package is not supported by the Network Loader since 20.Q2

release.

Do!

It is required to use unpacked Upgrade Package for all integration scenarios.

### 3.1.1 Network Loader Stepwise Upgrade

Network Loader upgrade to 20.Q4 or later versions cause failure of Zero Touch

integration on following board versions:

- Baseband 5212, &lt;R6
- Baseband 5216, &lt;R6

In these cases, Network Loader must be upgraded using stepwise procedure:

Steps

1. Upgrade Network Loader to 21.Q1 Network Loader (using UP indicated in Network Loader Version by Baseband Radio Node Upgrade Package). Follow Upgrade from Network Loader Version R3 on Baseband or Upgrade from Network Loader Version R4 or later on Baseband, depending on Network Loader Type 2 version.
2. Upgrade Network Loader to desired track from 21.Q1, following Upgrade from Network Loader Version R4 or later on Baseband. Note: Stepwise upgrade is not currently available for Ericsson Site Assistant.

## 3.2 Prerequisites

Before starting the procedure, the prerequisites in Documents, Tools and Conditions must be fulfilled.

### 3.2.1 Documents

The contents of the following documents are known:

- Personal Health and Safety Information
- System Safety Information
- Connect Client
- Ericsson Site Assistant Application

### 3.2.2 Tools

Use a laptop or mobile device that fulfills the following conditions:

- The laptop or mobile device has an SFTP server installed. Note: Only needed if the case methods described in Check Network Loader Version, Upgrade from Network Loader Version R3 on Baseband, or Upgrade from Network Loader Version R4 or later on Baseband are used. The SFTP server is used for storage and transfer of the configuration file, and the Upgrade Package to the node.
- The mobile device has the Ericsson Site Assistant (ESA) application installed.
- The IP address on the client interface is configured on the same subnet as the node interface, for example the Local Maintenance Terminal (LMT) port. Note: For units that do not have an LMT port, any TN or IDLe port can be used. The IP address is entered in the Host field and used for node connection to the SFTP server.
- The firewall is configured to allow SFTP server access.
- If the Baseband unit has a USB port, preloading the network loader from USB stick is possible. The USB stick must contain the encrypted network loader. The Baseband unit must have the latest decryption key installed. For more information, see Preload Upgrade Package Using USB Memory Stick.

### 3.2.3 Conditions

- The hardware unit is in storage, pre-deployment.
- The username, password, and IP address of the SFTP server of the client are available.

## 3.3 Upgrade Network Loader Using USB Memory Stick

At Baseband Radio Nodes with a USB port, it is possible to upload and upgrade the

network loader from a USB memory stick. The network loader on the USB memory stick is

encrypted. Once it is downloaded to the node, it is decrypted with the key preinstalled on

the Baseband Radio Node.

The network loader installed on the Baseband Radio Node and the key pair used for

encryption can be in one of the following relations:

- Fully compatible, if both contain the latest key versions, and the network loader has a version that supports USB port use. The USB memory stick can be used without further actions.
- Partially compatible, if the network loader installed on the Baseband Radio Node does not contain the latest key version. If the network loader is partially compatible with the latest key, a key replacement procedure is required. Do! Check Upgrade Network Loader to decide whether network loader is partially compatible or not compatible with latest key.
- Compatible only if the network loader installed on the Baseband Radio Node contains the latest key version. If the USB port cannot be used, the network loader has to be updated through the LMT port.

Prerequisites

- NL.cxp is downloaded from the Ericsson Software Gateway and encrypted as described in Preparation of USB Memory Stick and Encrypted Upgrade Package.
- Encrypted NL.cxp with XML boardlist containing information only about NL.cxp is copied to the USB memory stick.
- The public key is loaded to the Baseband Radio Node.
- The Baseband Radio Node is in network loader mode.

Steps

1. Transport the USB memory stick to the Baseband Radio Node and plug it in.
2. The Baseband Radio Node recognizes the USB memory stick and mounts it. The double flash of the LED diode indicates the start of the process.
3. The Baseband Radio Node loads and decrypts the network loader. Result: The network loader is available for use on the node.
4. The USB memory stick is unmounted. The LED diode indicates this by slow blinking.
5. Unplug the USB memory stick from the Baseband Radio Node. Result: The Baseband Radio Node restarts automatically on the new network loader version.

## 3.4 Check Network Loader Version

Prerequisites

- The applicable Upgrade Package revision and Network Loader version are chosen from Network Loader Version.

Steps

1. Download and unpack the most recent Upgrade Package from the Ericsson SW Gateway onto the client. The client acts as an SFTP server.
2. Power on the hardware unit and connect the client to the node. For more information, see Connect Client. Note: For units that do not have an LMT port, any TN or IDLe port can be used.
3. Start the web browser.
4. If the mobile device is using LMT port access, enter the https://169.254.2.2/ IP address to the Auto Integration web GUI. For other methods of connecting a mobile device to the node, refer to Connect Client.
5. Press the "?" button in the upper-left corner of the GUI and do the following:
    - Check the running Network Loader version. Note: The version is the last part of the appearing product identity, starting with the letter R.
    - Check which Auto Integration scenarios are supported.
6. Choose the update process based on the running Network Loader version:
    - If the running Network Loader version is R3, go to Upgrade from Network Loader Version R3 on Baseband
    - If the running Network Loader version is R4 or later, go to Upgrade from Network Loader Version R4 or later on Baseband.

## 3.5 Upgrade from Network Loader Version R3 on Baseband

Steps

1. Use the unzip command on Linux or the equivalent command on Windows to extract the RCS-DUS2*.cxp file from the Upgrade Package.

If the GUI has different tabs, do the following:

2. Use the Zero touch integration off-site pre-configuration tab. The old GUI has only one tab.
3. Enter the IP address of the SFTP server in the Host field. This is the IP address on the client interface. The SFTP server IP address must be on the same subnet as the node LMT port. For information about which subnet and IP address is assigned to the LMT interface when using Wi-Fi access, see Connect Client. Note: For units that do not have an LMT port, any TN or IDLe port can be used.
4. Enter the SFTP server username in the Username field.
5. Enter the SFTP server password in the Password field.
6. Enter the SFTP server file path and file name, RbsSummaryFile.xml.nl, in the File field. Alternatively, use the Browse button if this is seen in the GUI. The file must contain the tag initialSwFilePath which points to the RCS-DUS2*.cxp file. Example RbsSummaryFile.xml.nl &lt;summary:AutoIntegrationRbsSummaryFile xmlns:summary="http://www.ericsson.se/RbsSummaryFileSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ericsson.se/RbsSummaryFileSchemaSummaryFile.xsd"&gt; &lt;Format revision="F"/&gt; &lt;ConfigurationFiles initialSwFilePath="%Path to RCS-DUS2*.cxp%" /&gt; &lt;/summary:AutoIntegrationRbsSummaryFile&gt;
![Image](../images/133_1543-LZA7016014_1Uen.FD/additional_3_CP.png)
8. Select the Download files button to start the upgrade of Network Loader. Result: When the Upgrade Network Loader is finished, the unit shuts down and boots on the new Network Loader version.
9. Check if the Baseband unit has one of the following product numbers:
    - KDU 137 925/31 R1D
    - KDU 137 925/31 R1D/A
    - KDU 137 925/31 R1E, produced before 2016-02-06
    - KDU 137 925/31 R2A
    - KDU 137 925/31 R3C
    - KDU 137 925/41 R1D
    - KDU 137 925/41 R1D/A
    - KDU 137 925/41 R1E, produced before 2016-02-06
    - KDU 137 925/41 R2A
    - KDU 137 925/41 R3C
    - KDU 137 866/11 R1B

If the Baseband unit has one of the listed product numbers, do the following:

9. Repeat the steps from Step 2 to Step 7. This time, in Step 6, the initialSwFilePath tag in the RbsSummaryFile.xml.nl must point to the Upgrade Package zip file, not to the RCS-DUS2*.cxp file. Example RbsSummaryFile.xml.nl &lt;summary:AutoIntegrationRbsSummaryFile xmlns:summary="http://www.ericsson.se/RbsSummaryFileSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ericsson.se/RbsSummaryFileSchemaSummaryFile.xsd"&gt; &lt;Format revision="F"/&gt; &lt;ConfigurationFiles initialSwFilePath="%Path to Upgrade Package%" /&gt; &lt;/summary:AutoIntegrationRbsSummaryFile&gt;
