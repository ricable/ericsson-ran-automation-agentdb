# 6 Remedy Actions for FieldReplaceableUnit: Antenna branches: Faulty (&lt;Low - High&gt;) % , Degraded (&lt;Low - High&gt;) %

This alarm is raised when a HW fault is detected that result in degradation of the

service provided by the alarming MO. The equipment needs to be replaced to provide

full service.

The alarm is raised with the following additional text only if more than a small

percentage of branches are faulty or degraded because of a detected hardware fault.

This percentage threshold is hard-coded.

The additional text of the alarm can be one of the following:

- Antenna branches: Faulty (&lt;Low - High&gt;) % , Degraded (&lt;Low - High&gt;) %
- Antenna branches: Faulty (&lt;Low - High&gt;) %
- Antenna branches: Degraded (&lt;Low - High&gt;) %

The AAS has built-in redundancy so it is recommended to check the KPIs for

accessibility, retainability and throughput before replacing the hardware unit. In

many cases the AAS radio with faulty antenna branches can provide good service

without degradation in the performance. The KPI impact is sometimes only noticeable

at peak load in the cell and it is dependent on cell dimensioning and surrounding

neighboring cells.

The additional text can have a Mixed Mode with other ME

extension, which indicates that it is shared with another Managed Element and it is

possibly in conflict with another RAN.
