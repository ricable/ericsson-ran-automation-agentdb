access migration, expansion, and replacement cases for Baseband and Streetmacro Radio

Nodes used in the Ericsson RAN solution:

|------------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        |    |                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Replacement            |    | A faulty Baseband unit is replaced with a new identical unit.                                                                                                     |

The integration of a Baseband Radio Node is not covered in this document. For information

about integration planning and network provisioning, see Integration Planning and Infrastructure Guidelines.

For more information about integration methods, network infrastructure requirements, and

hardware binding, see Integrate Baseband Radio Node.

For cases not covered in this document, refer to the instruction for the relevant

hardware in ELEX.

# 2 Expansion User Guides

Expansion is a series of activities performed to expand an existing Baseband Radio Node

in the network with additional sectors and cells. Nodes can also be expanded with a

Radio Gateway or a LC-05 9xCPRI line card.

RAN Compute units are divided into RAN Compute groups. To determine the relevant

RAN

Compute group for a RAN Compute unit, see RAN Compute Groups in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Zero touch integration is supported for expansion use cases and is also valid for

expanding radio and antenna units when they are connected to a Baseband unit.

## 2.1 Baseband Radio Node Expansion

Expansion of a Baseband Radio Node with additional sectors and cells is performed using

ENM, ECT, or manual configuration.

For detailed instructions, see Expand Baseband Radio Node.

## 2.2 Baseband Radio Node Expansion with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI Line Card in Conversion Mode

Expansion of a Baseband Radio Node with a Radio Gateway R608, Radio Gateway R308, or

LC-05 9xCPRI line card in Conversion Mode is performed using ENM or manual

configuration. This type of expansion is supported for the RAN Compute

group

4b, 5 and

6.

For detailed instructions, see Expand Baseband Radio Node with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI Line

Card in Conversion Mode.

# 3 Hardware Migration User Guides

Hardware migration is a series of activities performed to migrate a Baseband or

Streetmacro Radio Node to a newer hardware generation.

RAN Compute units are divided into RAN Compute groups. To determine the relevant

RAN Compute

group

for a RAN Compute unit, see RAN Compute Groups in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Ensure

that the Basebands involved in the hardware migration have the same RAT

support, for detail,

see

Supported Baseband Configurations in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

## 3.1 Migration Using NETCONF-Based Procedure

The NETCONF-based hardware migration is supported within RAN Compute groups 4, 5, and 6

where migration can be performed from a lower RAN Compute group unit to a higher one.

For detailed instructions, see Migrate Baseband Unit Using NETCONF-Based Procedure.

## 3.2 Migration Using Backup and Restore

Hardware

migration using backup and restore applies to the following use cases:

- Migration from RAN Compute 5a to RAN Compute 5b
- Migration from RAN Compute 5c to RAN Compute 5d

For detailed instructions, see

Migrate RAN Compute Unit Using Backup and

Restore.

# 4 Radio Access Migration User Guides

Radio access migration is a series of activities performed to migrate a radio access

technology from a source node to a target node.

## 4.1 LTE Radio Access Migration

LTE radio access migration is only supported for RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group

1, 3, 4,

5 and

6

if the radio access technology is supported by the hardware type and the hardware

capacity is fulfilled. The following migration cases are supported for these groups:

- In any direction for units in the same RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 4 to RAN Compute group 4.
- To a later RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 3 to RAN Compute groups 4. 5, or 6, but not to RAN Compute groups 1.

For more information about supported hardware types for migration and RAN Compute groups,

see Supported Baseband Configurations and RAN Compute Groups in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

For detailed instructions, see Migrate Radio Access.

## 4.2 NR and NR in Mixed Mode with LTE Radio Access Migration

NR radio access migration is only supported for RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 1,

3, 4,

5 and

6

if the radio access technology is supported by the hardware type and the hardware

capacity is fulfilled. The following migration cases are supported for these groups:

- In any direction for units in the same RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 4 to RAN Compute group 4.
- To a later RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 3 to RAN Compute groups 4, 5 or 6, but not to RAN Compute groups 1.

For more information about supported hardware types for migration and RAN Compute groups,

see Supported Baseband Configurations and RAN Compute Groups in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

For detailed instructions, see Migrate Radio Access.

# 5 Replacement User Guides

## 5.1 Baseband Replacement Using ENM

Replacement using ENM is performed to replace a faulty baseband unit with a new identical

unit. The ENM hardware replacement procedure is initiated through an Auto Provisioning

project using ENM CLI, or the ENM Auto Provisioning UI.

Replacement can be performed using the following methods:

- Zero Touch
- LMT

For detailed instructions, see Replace Baseband Using ENM. For instructions on hardware

replacement using the Auto Provisioning UI, see the online help section for

Auto

Provisioning in ENM.
