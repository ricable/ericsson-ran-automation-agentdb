![Image](../images/12446-2886Uen.M/additional_3_CP.png)

Do!

The casing surrounding overheated batteries might become soft and warped. Check

batteries for signs of overheating. Replace damaged batteries according to

instructions.

If you suspect that batteries are overheated, check the following:

- The internal temperature of the equipment is below +60°C (140°F).
- The batteries have not leaked.

To correct the problem:

Steps

1. Replace overheated batteries.
2. Treat leakages from batteries as described in Treating Hazardous Waste from Leaks.

## 3.2 Treating Hazardous Waste from Leaks

![Image](../images/12446-2886Uen.M/additional_3_CP.png)

Do!

Acid causes corrosion, which can seriously damage the product. Check batteries

for signs of acid leakage. Replace leaking batteries according to instructions.

Ensure that sufficient absorbers or neutralizing materials are available on site to deal with

cases of a spillage of hazardous substances. Spillage can occur when installing, removing,

replacing, or servicing batteries. The absorbers and neutralizing materials must be suitable

for the hazardous substances involved. Typical neutralizing agents are shown in Table 1.

Table 1   Typical Neutralizers

| Typical Neutralizers              | Chemical Compound   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Baking soda  (sodium bicarbonate) | NaHCO3              |
| Sal soda                          | Na2CO310H2O         |
| Soda ash                          | Na2CO3              |

# 4 Electrical Installation

This section contains information that ensures that AC and DC powered products are not

damaged because of improper installation.

![Image](../images/12446-2886Uen.M/additional_3_CP.png)

Stop!

Improper installation or modification of AC or DC powered equipment might

seriously damage the equipment. Only a qualified and authorized electrician is permitted

to install or modify electrical installations.

Do!

The cable shield (stranded or weaved braid or drain wires) is part of the

equipment lightning protection and must be correctly connected to avoid damage to

the equipment.

Ensure that the cable shield is assembled properly according to

the instructions.

## 4.1 Safety Precautions for Working with Electrical Installations

Observe the following precautions when working with electrical

installations:

Steps

1. Ensure that approved circuit breakers or fuses are installed.
2. Ensure that the cables used have a sufficient cross-sectional area in accordance with product requirements and local laws and regulations.
3. Ensure that conductors are connected according to the connection diagram.
4. Label the cables correctly.
5. Check the installation work upon completion.

# 5 Electrostatic Discharge

This section contains information and instructions on Electrostatic

Discharge (ESD) product safety. ESD is described below.

## 5.1 Using ESD Wrist Strap

Always use an ESD wrist strap when working with ESD sensitive components, even in equipment

rooms fitted with ESD protective floor covering. Although ESD floor covering reduces the

risk of ESD, if the wrong type of shoes are used, or if the person is already charged when

they enter the room, the floor covering in itself does not protect from this.

Figure 5   Standard ESD Wrist Strap

The ESD wrist strap contains a resistor with resistance greater than 1 MΩ in the

cable to protect the user. The resistance value is low enough to discharge the electrostatic

voltage. The ESD wrist strap must be connected to ground.

To use the ESD wrist strap:

Steps

1. Place the ESD wrist strap around your wrist. Ensure that the ESD wrist strap is in contact with the skin.
2. Connect the other end of the cable to the closest grounding (earthing) point on the equipment.
3. Always use the wrist strap when and where its use is required.

## 5.2 Handling Printed Board Assemblies and IC Components

Treating all components as if they are ESD sensitive, whether they have IC components

or not, reduces the risk of ESD and increases the operating time between failure.

![Image](../images/12446-2886Uen.M/additional_3_CP.png)

Do!

This product contains components sensitive to ESD. Use an approved ESD wrist

strap, connected to the product grounding point, to avoid damaging these

components.

## 5.3 Storing and Transporting Printed Board Assemblies and IC Components

When storing or transporting printed board assemblies or IC components,

ensure one of the following:

- The item is stored or transported in its original packaging, or in other ESD approved material.
- Use shielding bags or boxes with shielding properties made out of conductive material if the item is to be stored or transported outside an ESD Approved Area.
