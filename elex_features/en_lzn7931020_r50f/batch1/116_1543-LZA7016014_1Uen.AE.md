# 2 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: No IP connectivity towards NTP server

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards Synchronization server is

present for more than two hours.

The fault can occur when it is not possible to communicate with NTP server.

If no synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb the

network Synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the attribute syncServerNtpIpAddress in MO NtpFrequencySync is configured in accordance with the Network Synchronization Plan.
3. If the value of syncServerNtpIpAddress is in accordance with the Network Synchronization Plan, go to step 5.
4. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
5. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Ensure that the transport network is configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
7. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
8. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Verify the connectivity toward the NTP server, using ping under the MO Router. For example: Example ping --interface &lt;source IP address&gt;(LDN of an AddressIPv4 MO)
10. If the alarm remains but there is connection toward the NTP server, go to Step 14. If there is no connection toward the NTP server, continue with the next step.
11. Contact the maintenance center for the NTP server or the network. Request them to act on the fault. There can be a configuration fault in the network or the NTP server is disabled.
12. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.
13. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. Consult the next level of maintenance support. Further actions are outside of the scope of this instruction.

# 3 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: NTP server IP address cannot be resolved

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards Synchronization server is

present for more than two hours.

The fault can occur when the IP address cannot be resolved using DNS.

If no synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb the

network Synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the attribute syncServerNtpIpAddress in MO NtpFrequencySync is configured with domain name in accordance with the Network Synchronization Plan.
3. If it is a valid domain name, go to Step 6.
4. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
5. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Examine the value of the attribute serverAddress in MO DnsClient to be configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
7. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
8. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Verify the connectivity toward the DNS server, using ping under the MO Router. For example: Example ping --interface &lt;source IP address&gt;(LDN of an AddressIPv4 MO)
10. If the alarm remains but there is no connection toward the DNS server, go to Step 14. If there is connection toward the DNS server, continue with the next step.
11. Contact the maintenance center for that DNS server. Request them to act on the fault. The DNS service can be disabled or no record can be found for the domain name.
12. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.
13. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. Consult the next level of maintenance support. Further actions are outside of the scope of this instruction

# 4 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: No granted service from PTP Grandmaster

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards Synchronization server is

present for more than two hours.

The fault can occur when unicast negotiation is denied or canceled by PTP

Grandmaster, or when no unicast negotiation response is received from PTP

Grandmaster.

If no synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb the

network Synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the attribute associatedGrandmaster in MO PtpBcOcPort is configured in accordance with the Network Synchronization Plan.
3. If the value of associatedGrandmaster is in accordance with the Network Synchronization Plan, go to Step 6.
4. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
5. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Ensure that the attribute durationField in MO PtpBcOcPort is configured in accordance with the ITU-T G.8265.1.
7. If the value of durationField is in accordance with the ITU-T G.8265.1, go to Step 10.
8. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
9. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

10. Ensure that the transport network is configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
11. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.
12. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

13. Verify the connectivity toward the PTP Grandmaster, using ping under the MO Router.
14. If the alarm remains but there is connection toward the PTP Grandmaster, go to Step 17. If there is no connection toward the PTP Grandmaster, continue with the next step.
15. Contact the maintenance center for the PTP Grandmaster. Request them to ensure that PTP Grandmaster is configured in accordance with the ITU-T G.8265.1 and that the PTP Grandmaster is enabled.
16. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.
17. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

18. Consult the next level of maintenance support. Further actions are outside of the scope of this instruction.

# 5 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: No messages are received from PTP Grandmaster

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards Synchronization server is

present for more than two hours.

The fault can occur when it is not possible to communicate with PTP Grandmaster. This

can be caused by IP network problems, communication problem, error in configuration,

wrong IP address, DNS problems or wrong domain name.

If no synchronization reference is available, the fault can stop or disturb the

network Synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Verify the connectivity toward the PTP Grandmaster, using ping under the MO Router.

4. Contact the maintenance center for the PTP Grandmaster or the network. Request them to act on the fault. There can be a configuration fault in the network or the PTP Grandmaster can be disabled.
5. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.
6. If the alarm ceases, exit this procedure.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

7. Consult the next level of maintenance support. Further actions are outside of the scope of this instruction.

# 6 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: PTP Grandmaster cannot be resolved

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards Synchronization server is

present for more than two hours.

The fault can be caused by IP network problems, communication problem, error in

domain name configuration, error in DNS client configuration or when DNS server is

unreachable.
