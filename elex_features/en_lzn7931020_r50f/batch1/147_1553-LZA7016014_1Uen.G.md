# 1 Automated Health Check Overview

Automated Health Check (AHC) is used for validating, troubleshooting, and managing

node health in ENM Flow Automation.

Functions

AHC provides the following functions:

- Hardware-agnostic and automated health checks
- Reusable health check reports

Application

AHC supports the operator in health check automation for Baseband integration,

expansion, and migration projects.

Supported Node Types

AHC can be used for all Baseband Radio Nodes and fronthaul routers in the Ericsson

portfolio.

Limitations

A maximum number of 16 network elements are supported for batch health checks.

## 1.1 System Requirements

ENM version 22.Q1 or later is required.

## 1.2 ENM User Roles for AHC

Access control is needed for ENM users to prepare AHC installation packages and run

health checks.

For detailed instructions on setting up ENM user roles for AHC, see section Role

Management in ENM Online Help.

| ENM Capabilities        | Operation   |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Scripting CLI scripting | Execute     |
| CM-CLI                  | Read        |
| Scripting Access CLI    | Execute     |
| Scripting Cron Service  | Execute     |
| Node Security           | Read        |

## 1.3 AHC Framework

The AHC framework is the back-end installed on the ENM scripting host to enable the

execution of scripts using AHC Flow.

The solution provides an open framework that allows easy extension.

The /AHC/Reports folder is relevant for AHC users. This folder

collects reports that give an overview of health check results based on the default AHC

profile and shows if the results pass or fail the managed objective readiness

target.

# 2 AHC Setup and Launch

## 2.1 Downloading AHC

To ensure that AHC is fully functional, it is important that the latest version of the

installation package is used. The latest version can be downloaded from the Ericsson

Software Gateway.

Table 4   AHC Product Information

| Product Line:   | Life Cycle Management                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Number: | CXF2010013  A detailed AHC User Guide is included in the product package. |

## 2.2 Set Up and Launch AHC

Prerequisites

- Required access control is granted to the ENM user.
- The installation package for AHC is available as a ZIP file.

Steps

1. Launch the Flow Automation application in ENM.
2. Go to View Flow Catalog.
3. Import the installation package by clicking Import Flow and choosing the .zip.
4. Wait for the installation to be completed. Result: The AHC Flow is shown in the Flow Catalog list.

Results

AHC can be launched in ENM.

# 3 Basic AHC Workflow

The basic AHC workflow contains the following phases:

## 3.1 Using the Default AHC Profile

The AHC Framework offers only a default AHC profile. The user must include this profile

in the execution phase when configuring the AHC Flow. The default AHC profile contains

the checks that are used to determine the health status throughout the AHC flow.

## 3.2 Configure and Execute AHC Using Flow Automation

AHC can be configured and executed with Flow Automation, which is a basic application

in ENM.

Flow Automation supports the automation of basic daily tasks and complex end-to-end

activities. For more information about Flow Automation, see ENM Online Help.

Prerequisites

- Target nodes to be diagnosed or validated.
- NHC profile is available. Note: NHC is an application used to perform health checks on nodes and Network Elements in ENM. NHC is also used to manage acceptance criteria, which determine if a health check passes or fails on a node. For more information about NHC, see Manage Node Health Check.
- Default AHC profile is available.

Steps

1. Launch the Flow Automation application in ENM.
2. Select Automated Health Check Flow and click Start to create a Flow Instance.
3. Provide a name for the new Flow Instance.
4. Under Choose Setup, select setup type Interactive or File Input.
    - If the Interactive setup type is selected, go to step Step 5.
    - If the File Input setup type is selected, click Choose file to select the.json file or the.zip file to set up the AHC flow, then go to Step 9.
5. Select the Network Elements to be included in the Flow Instance.
6. Review the selected nodes to ensure that all relevant nodes are included.
7. Select the NHC profile to be applied.
8. Select the default AHC profile to be applied.
9. Configure scheduling to execute the flow by choosing either Start immediately or Start at specific time.
10. Review and confirm the configuration.
11. Wait for the AHC flow to be executed and completed. Time needed depends on the type of health checks and number of nodes configured in the flow.

## 3.3 Reading AHC Reports

A summary and health check reports are available after a completed AHC Flow

instance.

A summary is shown in the Summary pane in the Report

tab of ENM.

In addition to the summary, the following types of reports are created:

- A Flow Automation report, which provides an overview of the health check results. This report is embedded in ENM and accessed using the ENM GUI.
- An offline AHC report is generated based on the default AHC profile to provide a more user-friendly way to navigate the health check results in detail. This report is stored in the /Reports folder and opened using a web browser.
