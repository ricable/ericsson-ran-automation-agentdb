# 2 Remedy Actions for &lt;Carrier MO&gt; or &lt;Trx MO&gt;: Insufficient RF power in radio equipment.

Resource Allocation Failure is raised when the capacity

requirement is not fulfilled due to insufficient RF power or HWAC capacity.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the cell, the sector carrier, or the Trx MO.
3. Decrease the requested power for each SectorCarrier MO or add a radio unit to support more power. Also consider the power configuration of other SectorCarrier, NRSectorCarrier, or NodeBSectorCarrier, Trx or ExtTrx MO that uses the same radio in a Mixed-Mode configuration. In case of eCPRI-based AASs, ensure that a sufficient level of HWAC is installed for the required hardware-related capacity. Consider the overall HWAC requirement of the node and check the output power configuration of other instances of the following MOs: ExtTrx NRSectorCarrier NodeBSectorCarrier SectorCarrier Trx
4. Unlock the cell, the SectorCarrier or the Trx MO.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Actions for &lt;Cell MO&gt;: Baseband interconnect resource shortage

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the status of all Baseband units. If there is at least one Baseband unit with operationalState set to DISABLED in the corresponding PlugInUnit MO instance, resolve that first.
3. Lock the cell.
4. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Reconfigure the SectorCarrier MO to use less TX branches and RX branches.
6. Lock the cell.
7. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Reduce the number of TX branches and RX branches in other SectorCarrier MOs that are located on the same Baseband unit as the failing cell. The attribute hostingDigitalUnit shows on which Baseband unit each cell is located.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Actions for &lt;Cell MO&gt;: Failed to allocate path

Steps

Perform the following steps in order to decide which procedure will remedy this

alarm.

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the CPRI capacity of the Baseband unit and radio unit according to the following table. Table 2 CPRI Support for IQ Slots CPRI Line Rate Number of IQ Slots 2.5 Gbps 16 5 Gbps 32 10 Gbps 64 Note: For more information on CPRI capacity, see Radio Node Configurations and CPRI Capacity Examples.
3. Calculate the number of IQ slots in use according to the following formulas. Table 3 Maximum Number of IQ Slots in Use for FDD and TDD Bandwith Maximum IQ Slots in Use 10 MHz 4 15 MHz 6 20 MHz 8 FDD (number of cells) × (total number of antennas for both TX and RX) × (number of used IQ slots for cells) For example, 2 cells, 4 x 2, 10 MHz bandwidth is 2 × (4+2) × 4 = 48 IQ slots used. TDD (number of cells) × (maximum number of antennas for both TX and RX) × (number of used IQ slots for cells) For example, 2 cells, 4 x 2, 10 MHz bandwidth is 2 × 4 × 4 = 32 IQ slots used.
4. If the IQ slots used for the total configured cell exceed the CPRI capacity, use the following remedy actions.
5. Check the operationalState attribute and the presence of Link Failure alarms on the RiLink MO used by the cell.
6. If the Link Failure alarm appears on the RiLink MO, use the following remedy actions.
7. If the LTE system and CDMA system (XMU) are out of sync for XMU02 LTE and CDMA mixed mode configuration, use the following remedy actions.

## 4.1 Remedy Actions for IQ Slots Exceed the CPRI Capacity

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Adjust the number of cells, number of antennas, or carrier bandwidth.
3. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

## 4.2 Remedy Actions for Link Failure for Multi-Link Configurations

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the cell.
3. Replace the faulty link.
4. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

## 4.3 Remedy Actions for LTE System and WCDMA System Out of Sync

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the cell.
3. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Restart the XMU 02.

# 5 Remedy Actions for &lt;Cell MO&gt;: No common sampling rate between baseband and radio

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the cell.
3. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Restart each radio unit that is used for the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Restart the Baseband unit that is used for the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following for further troubleshooting:

6. Enable the cell with less capacity. Result: If the cell has become enabled, availabilityStatus is set to DEGRADED in the corresponding cell MO instance. This indicates that the cell uses less TX branches, RX branches, or both, compared to the configuration in the applicable SectorCarrier MO.
    1. Lock one of the radio units used for the cell.
    2. Lock the cell.
    3. Unlock the cell.
    4. Repeat Step Step 5.a to Step Step 5.c until the cell becomes enabled or until each radio unit has been tried.

# 7 Remedy Actions for NRSectorCarrier or &lt;Cell MO&gt; or &lt;Trx MO&gt;: Unable to allocate baseband HW resources for this MO.

For High-Band cells and RAN Compute group 5 or higher, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Prerequisites

For NR cells, if the associated NRCellDU MO is locked in a short

time prior to the alarm being raised for the NRSectorCarrier

start by locking the sector carrier, and then unlock the sector carrier.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Delete excessive sector carriers, cells, TRXs or extension TRXs.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Delete the sector carrier, cell, TRX or extension TRX and set it up again with the same attributes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Restart the faulty unit with restartRank RESTART\_WARM.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check if the radio units used in the sector are compatible. For further information, see Radio Node Configurations.
3. If the radio units are not compatible, replace one of the radio units with a unit of a compatible type.

Until the radio unit is replaced, do the following:

4. Enable the cell with less capacity. Result: The cell becomes enabled with availabilityStatus set to DEGRADED in the corresponding cell MO instance. This indicates that the cell uses less TX branches, RX branches, or both, compared to the configuration in the applicable SectorCarrier MO.
    1. Lock the radio unit to be replaced.
    2. Lock the cell.
    3. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 9 Remedy Actions for EUtranCellTDD: Carrier Overlap when carrierCnt is &lt;cnt&gt;.

The alarm is raised if the bandwidth and the frequency of two carriers connected to

one radio overlap.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the EUtranCellTDD.channelBandwidth and the EUtranCellTDD.earfcn attribute of the EUtranCellTDD MO instances that refer to the same radio.
3. Lock the cell.
4. Modify the attributes to values that no longer overlap.
5. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:
