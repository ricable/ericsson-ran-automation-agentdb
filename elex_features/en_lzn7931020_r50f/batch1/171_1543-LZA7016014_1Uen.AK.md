# 2 Remedy Action for DeviceGroup: RF port &lt;port id&gt; is degraded[ (Mixed Mode with other ME)].

The Linearization Disturbance Performance Degraded alarm

originates from a radio.

The radio continues to carry traffic with operational state of

DEGRADED. The cell(s) transmitting with this radio maintain

their cell coverage/size with approximately 10% to 20% reduction in data

throughput.

Prerequisites

- All concerned NOCs are informed that work is about to start.
- The alarm has not automatically been cleared by the system

- The following documents have been read and understood: Handling Faulty Equipment Personal Health and Safety Information System Safety Information
- Other documentation referenced within the alarm operating instruction is available.
- Access to a node management tool is secured, if required.
- Access to the site is secured, if on-site activities are required.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the radio that raised the alarm.

If the alarm is raised for the first time from this radio, it is recommended to

monitor the alarm to see if it automatically clears in 24 hours. The cell

continues to operate at near full capacity.

If the alarm does not automatically cease or multiple alarm occurrences happen

on this radio, do the following:

3. Restart the unit.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Switch the power off and on.

If the alarm reoccurs, do the following:

5. Write a Site Failure Note (SFN). See Handling Faulty Equipment.

The cell continues to operate at near full capacity. Continue only if ready to

replace the alarm reporting radio.

If ready to replace the alarm reporting radio, do the following:

6. Lock the faulty radio. See Replacing Radio Units or Replacing Remote Radio Units.
7. Unlock the unit.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for FieldReplaceableUnit: RF port &lt;port id&gt; is degraded[ (Mixed Mode with other ME)].

The Linearization Disturbance Performance Degraded alarm is raised when an attempted recovery from a linearization disturbance on

the downlink of a transceiver fails. The uplink of the transceiver is not affected.

The Linearization Disturbance Performance Degraded alarm originates from a radio.

The radio continues to carry traffic with operational state of

DEGRADED. The cell(s) transmitting with this radio maintain

their cell coverage/size with approximately 10% to 20% reduction in data
