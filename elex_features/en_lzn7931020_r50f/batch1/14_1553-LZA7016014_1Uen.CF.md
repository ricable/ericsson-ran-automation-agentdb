## 1.1 Performance Management

Performance Management is the evaluation of network behavior based on performance data

generated in the Network Elements. Performance Management ensures reliable and efficient use

of the network through the following:

- Monitoring
- Identifying trends
- Troubleshooting
- Optimizing performance

### 1.1.1 Network Aspects

Performance data gives information about the following aspects

of the network:

| Accessibility      |    | The ability of a service to be obtained when requested by the user within specified             tolerances and other given conditions     |
|--------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                           |

## 1.2 Performance Data Types

Performance data for a Baseband Radio Node consists of the following:

- Performance statistics
- Performance events

For troubleshooting, direct access to real-time performance statistics is supported.

Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L) provides additional PM statistics produced from PM

events. For more information, see Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L).

## 1.3 Tools

An Operation and Support System (OSS) is used for the following:

- Management of the performance data measurements
- Analysis of the measurement results

ENIQ can be used for the following:

- Additional measurements of performance data
- Further processing of performance data
- Analysis of performance data

For direct access to performance statistics, the following

tools are used:

- ECLI
- EMCLI

## 1.4 Performance Statistics

Performance statistics are collected from measurements on

live traffic in the radio and transport networks. Performance Statistics are a

subcategory of PM Counters.

For detailed information about each PM counter, valid for a

given release, see the applicable MOM.

A predefined set of performance statistics measurements is included at delivery, and

available immediately after the startup of the Network Element. The PM counter list

shows which performance statistics measurements are predefined. The OSS automatically starts the predefined set of performance

statistics measurements.

In addition to the predefined performance statistics, the user defines which performance

statistics to measure. When the user-defined performance statistics and the measurement

methods are defined, the measurement must be activated to start measuring.

### 1.4.1 Performance Statistics MOM

In MOM,

the performance statistics measurements are managed in the Pm MO

class.

Each measurement is represented by an instance of the

MeasurementType MO. The measurement types are grouped into PM

groups under the PmGroup MO instance.

PM group names for flexible counters have

the

prefix PmFlex to

indicate

that the group contains flexible counters.

Each PM group has a reference to one application MO class. Several PM groups may refer to

the same application MO class.

Starting, modifying, and stopping a performance statistics measurement are done in the OSS through a PM job. In the MOM, a PM job is represented by an instance

of the PmJob MO.

Measurement

results are reported in ROP files.

The

number of ROP files per Result Out Period is controlled by the value of

FileHandlingMethod in the

PmSupport.ropFileHandling

attribute. The

PmSupport.ropFileHandling

attribute is found under the NodeSupport MO. By

default, the measurement results for all PM jobs are reported in one ROP file, and this

value is set to SINGLE\_ROP\_FILE. If the value is set to

MULTIPLE\_ROP\_FILES, the measurement results are reported in one ROP

file per defined PM job group. The PmJob.jobGroup attribute is used

to define PM job groups.

After a restart of the Network Element, the state of the PM

jobs is the same as before the restart.

### 1.4.2 Performance Statistics ROP Files

For each performance statistics measurement, the result is presented in one or more

statistical files at the end of every Result Output Period (ROP). The ROP files are collected

by the OSS for analysis. They are stored at the Network Element for 24

hours, or until one of the following conditions is met:

- The maximum number of files reaches the value defined in the PmMeasurementCapabilities.maxNoOfPmFiles attribute.

The supported Granularity Period and the ROP are 15

minutes.

The performance statistics ROP files are in XML format and

compressed using GZIP. The ROP file format is defined by 3GPP in the following

specifications:

- 3GPP TS 32.432 V10.0
- 3GPP TS 32.435 V10.0

By default, the measurement results of all PM jobs are

reported in one ROP file per ROP. However, the measurement results from groups of PM

jobs can be reported in one ROP file per PM job group. This is done by configuring

multiple ROP files. If multiple ROP files are configured, the ROP file names include the

name of the PM job group in the UniqueId field of the file

name. If the PM job group is not set for a PM job, then the PM job ends up in the

default ROP file, without the PM job group in the name.

In the ROP file, the measurements are reported in groups

according to the PM jobs, and not according to the measured MOs. Therefore, measurements

from the same MO included in different PM jobs are reported in different places in the

ROP file.

After a restart of the Network Element, one ROP file is

always lost. If the restart occurs at the end of one ROP and the start of another one,

two ROP files are lost.

Only complete ROPs are made available in a PM Counter ROP

file. If a program restarts, it cannot provide complete data during the restart time.

Therefore, counters provided by the program are discarded for each incomplete ROP.

If a single counter or subset of the counters for an MO

instance and PM job are considered unreliable, PM counters can be flagged as suspect in

the ROP file. The suspect flag is set and the counter value is reported as a blank

space.

### 1.4.3 Measurement Methods for Performance Statistics

Performance statistics are measured using the following measurement

methods:

| Accumulative Counter   |    | An Accumulative Counter measurement increases by the value of a sample. It indicates             the total sum of all sample values taken during a certain time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Peg                    |    | A Peg measurement is a special case of an accumulator measurement. It increases at each             occurrence of a specific activity. It can increase by 1 or other value, for example, to             accumulate the number of bits transferred because of a specific activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Scan                   |    | A Scan measurement is a special case of a Peg measurement. It increases by 1 each time             the corresponding Accumulative Counter increases, and indicates how many samples of a             certain quantity are taken. The average value of all samples is calculated by dividing             the result of an accumulator measurement by the result of a scan measurement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| PDF                    |    | A Probability Density Function measurement is an array of elements that can be used in             different ways.  The PDF measurement format can be used to represent a histogram where each element of             the array (bin) represents a range measurement. The range measurement increases every             time a sample of a single variable is measured to lie within the range for that range             measurement.  In this example, a variable is used to measure processor load utilization, with sampled             values split into four ranges as follows:    Range1 = [0..25]%      Range2 = [26..50]%     Range3 = [51..75]%     Range4 =                 [76..100]%     A sampled value is read every third minute over a 15-minute period with values [23, 88,             66, 52, 43]. Then the four range measurements would be reported as:    Range1 = 1     Range2 = 1     Range3 = 2     Range4 = 1     The PDF measurement format can also be used as a generic array of separate measurement,             where each measurement measures a different variable. |

| Compressed PDF         |    | A             compressed PDF measurement reports only the non-zero values. It can be used for a small             part of the range.  Example: The QCI PM measurements are arrays of PM measurements with no relationship             between the QCI values. A QCI PM measurement measures the number of establishment             attempts per QCI made by the E-RABs. Each element of the array is an Accumulative             Counter measurement that counts the number of E-RAB establishment attempts for a             specific QCI value.  In the following example the measurement result for a QCI [256] is as follows:    [0] = 0     [1] = 72     [2] = 0     [3] = 0     [4]                 = 0     [5] = 0     [6] = 44     [7] = 0     [8] = 0     [9] = 0     [255] = 0     Two QCI values are reported during the ROP: QCI1 has 72 attempts and QCI6 has 44             attempts. The first number in the result is the number of reported bins followed by bin             and bin values in pairs. Then the result in compressed PDF format is: 2, 1, 72, 6, 44.                  |

| Percentile             |    | A percentile is a measurement indicating the value below which a given percentage of             observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 95th percentile is the             value below which 95 percent of the observations are found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

- For the Gauge measurement method, the following parameters must be set: The MeasurementType.aggregation attribute must be set to one of the following values: LAST\_UPDATE MAX MIN The MeasurementType.collectionMethod attribute must be set to GAUGE
- If the PDF measurement method is used, the attribute MeasurementType.multiplicity must be larger than 1.
- The measurement type Compressed PDF must have the MeasurementType.isCompressed attribute set to TRUE.

### 1.4.4 Counter Categories and Filtering

Each in-use PM counter is classified into a PM category type: traffic or KPI. The type is

further divided into PM areas and the areas into traffic scenarios or KPI formulas.

The common PM areas used for both traffic and KPI are as follows:

- Accessibility
- Availability
- Integrity
- Mobility
- Retainability
- Utilization

Three more areas are used only for the traffic category type:

- Equipment
- IP O&amp;M
- Transport Network

The Managed Object Model (MOM) PM Counters folder in the CPI library has a filtering

function to narrow down the list of counters to a subset applicable to a particular

observability use case. For example, filtering by Traffic, Utilization and Baseband

Resources renders a list of only eight individual counters, out of around four thousand

counters present in the MOM.

Example 1   pmLcgThpVolUlLcg

```
Type: Traffic, Area: Integrity, Scenario: Throughput
Type: Traffic, Area: Utilization, Scenario: Volume
Type: KPI, Area: Integrity, Scenario: UplinkThroughput
```

### 1.4.5 Flexible Counters

Flexible counters make it possible to define a counter for any combination of filter

parameters, without the need to define counters for all combinations.

Flexible counters can be differentiated by operator-configurable filter parameters in

run-time. Flexible counters provide a framework for differentiated observability to be

able to produce flexible counters.

Sub-flexible

counters allow for stepping and interpreting flexible

counters.

Sub-flexible

counters are dynamically created in run-time depending on configured filter parameters

and are stored in ROP files.

For more information, see the document Flexible Counters.

## 1.5 Direct Access to Performance Statistics

For network troubleshooting, direct access to performance

statistics

is

provided. With direct access, real-time values are read without waiting for the Result

Out Period to finish. Measurements with references to an MO instance can also be

listed.

The majority of the measurements can be accessed directly and

included in a PM job at the same

time;

some are dedicated for troubleshooting and can only be accessed directly. The direct

access reading does not disturb the measuring in an active PM job.

The values of selected or all measurements with direct access

are read using command show-counters in Ericsson CLI and EMCLI. For

more information on the show-counters command, see

Ericsson CLI.

It is possible to manually display the values of counters

associated with an MO instance. To do this,

navigate

to the MO instance

in the Ericsson CLI and issue the show-counters

command. A single counter can be displayed by specifying its name on the command

line.

Sub-flexible counters can be displayed if a counter name starting with

pmFlex is specified and a filter configuration (using the

PmFlexCounterFilter MO class) is configured. For more information, see

Flexible Counters.

If no counter name is specified, all counters associated with the MO instance are

displayed.

## 1.6 Performance Events

A performance event is a recording of a number of parameters describing a specific

traffic event for a specific UE or from operator-selected cells. A performance event is

created when the traffic event occurs, for example, when a UE makes a handover to

another cell.

Data anonymization for performance events containing sensitive data is enabled by default

to protect end-user privacy. For more information, see Manage Security.

The performance event list can be downloaded by clicking on

the appropriate link, see Manage Lists.

The following types of event recording functions exist:

- Cell Trace
- UE Trace

Both recording functions support output to either file or stream, or file and stream

simultaneously.

Files are closed at the end of each ROP. Performance events associated with UEs, LCGs,

and radio bearers can be lost in the current ROP file if the selected UE is attached too

close (within 2 seconds) to the end of the ROP.

### 1.6.1 Cell Trace

The Cell Trace function records performance events from all

UEs, or a part of them, in one or more selected cells that belong to the same RBS. It

provides monitoring and evaluation capability of any traffic scenario, and gives

visibility of air interface quality and UE performance. When a new RBS is deployed, or a

new feature or frequency is deployed within an existing RBS, Cell Trace is used for

troubleshooting and optimization of the network.

Six Cell Trace recordings are prepared at delivery. This is

the maximum number of recordings that can be active simultaneously at the same network

element (NE).

In one of these six recordings, the events to record are

predefined. This recording is called Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR). The CCTR is

activated and starts recording automatically at the startup of the NE. It is deactivated

and stops recording only when the NE is shut down.

The CCTR job is predefined on the node and it includes predefined events to be traced.

There is only one instance of CCTR subscription type in OSS and

it is automatically created with state INACTIVE when the first eNodeB

is added to the OSS. Only the predefined CCTR job is

supported.

As additional nodes of relevant node types are added to the network, they are not added

to system defined subscriptions at the time of adding them to the OSS system. OSS will run an Audit at

scheduled intervals to update the system defined subscriptions with any new relevant

node added to the system. The default intervals for Audit running are 15-minute

intervals.

In the other five prepared recordings, the events to record are defined by the operator.

These are activated and deactivated by the operator.

The CCTR and one of the operator-defined recordings are

high-priority recordings. The other four recordings are normal priority recordings.

The starting and stopping of a cell trace recording is made

in the OSS through an event job. In the MOM, an event job is represented by an instance

of MO EventProducer.EventJob.

The recommendation for the continuous collection of pmEvents

is to use the CCTR profile (OSS Event Group) that is listed in document PM Event List

and delivered by streaming. See Trace Event Streaming. This to minimize the risk for

pmEvent data loss at the varying traffic.

### 1.6.2 UE Trace

UE Trace records performance events from individual, operator-selected UEs that travel

through a network. Radio events can be recorded for both the uplink and the downlink. These

recordings allow the network operator to identify parameters that must be adjusted,

particularly after changes made to or extension of the network.

UE Trace recordings are controlled from the MME.

Network elements record radio events associated with a UE when it is in the coverage area of

the network elements. As the UE leaves the coverage area and it is passed over to the next

network element, the configuration data of the trace recording moves with the UE. Based on the

configuration data, performance events are written to files or streamed to an external

receiver, or both. If events are written to files, they are collected by the OSS following the Cell Trace ROP period. Selected UEs are identified by

their IMSI or IMEI within the MME or by the OSS. Within the RAN, the

trace session for a UE is uniquely identified by a trace reference.

A maximum of 16 UEs can be recorded simultaneously at each network element.

UE Trace includes support for UE type and external type PM events, and several

non-UE-specific events related to the cell or the RBS.

The network element can be configured to filter any PM event, such as non-UE-specific events.

This filtering is not job-specific. It helps alleviate resource constraints of the file or

stream solution. The external event S1\_PAGING is filtered by default. If this event is not

filtered, it is recommended to have no more than eight UE Trace recordings active at the same

time. This is to avoid main processor overload. In these high load scenarios, the preferred UE

Trace output solution is streaming.

### 1.6.3 Performance Events Data Files

The recorded data consists of Cell Trace and UE Trace recordings, standardized and

proprietary events. For detailed information about the performance events file format,

see Performance Event Format.

The Cell Trace recordings are presented in three ROP files for each Managed Function at

the end of every ROP. Two of the ROP files contain the results from the high priority

event jobs. One contains the results from the normal event jobs. The result of each UE

Trace recording is presented in one ROP file. The ROP duration is 15 minutes.

A UE trace session is identified by a trace reference, which is part of the file name and

commonly used for all network elements involved in the UE Trace. UE Trace files are

closed at the end of the ROP in the same manner as Cell Trace files. A single UE Trace

file has multiple trace recording sessions if the UE becomes active multiple times

within the same ROP.

Performance Events data files contain compressed PM events for each ROP and are stored on

the Network Element.

PM event retention can be controlled for an even producer, such as LRAT, by configuring a

maximum file size for each of the three file types (CCTR, Normal Priority and High

Priority). However, configuration of a larger maximum file size does not guarantee that

the space is available, as PM Event storage is ultimately limited by the size of the RAM

disk used to store all the files. For eNodeB deployments, RAN Compute

groups

4

and 5 have a 270MB RAM

disk.

For more information on RAN Compute

groups,

see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

When the RAM disk is 270MB, the CCTR job and the High Priority job each have a dedicated

file with a maximum configurable size of 30MB and the remaining 4 Normal Priority jobs

share a Normal Priority file which has a maximum configurable size of 100MB. When the

RAM disk size is 135MB, the maximum configurable sizes are halved (CCTR and High

Priority: 15MB, Normal Priority: 50MB).

The maximum configurable size of each UE trace file is 1000 kilobytes (compressed).

How long ROP files remain at the Network Element depends on the ROP file size and

available storage space. The ROP files are continuously collected by the OSS for analysis and storage.

Cell and UE Trace ROP files are deleted by the node if they are more than 25 hours old.

Newer files are removed when the RAM disk reaches the 95% full threshold. The 95%

threshold means that for a 270MB RAM disk only 95% (256MB) is available. Another

consideration is that ENM needs time to collect the ROP files. If ENM takes a full ROP

to collect files, then space is required to store two ROP of PM Event files. This means

128MB of PM Event data can be stored in files per ROP. ENM file recovery requires that 3

ROP are stored on disk (the current ROP plus 2). This requires cell and UE trace data

volumes to not exceed 85MB per ROP. For a 135MB RAM disk, 128MB becomes 64MB for two

ROP, and 42.5 for three ROP.

For more information on ENM file recovery, see ENM System Capacity CPI.

When the RAM disk reaches the 95% threshold and with space only available for less than

four ROP, file removal considers both age and priority of the ROP files. Normal Priority

file is overwritten ahead of the High Priority file and the High Priority file is

overwritten ahead of the CCTR file. When a file is overwritten, it is replaced with a

file containing a single PM Event

(INTERNAL\_EVENT\_FILE\_CONTENT\_REMOVED\_FOR\_HIGHER\_PRIORITY\_FILES).

Additionally, the current incomplete ROP file is removed ahead of the first previous ROP

file. CCTR files for the current and previous ROP have the highest priority and are

never removed.

Increasing the Normal Priority maximum file size beyond 30MB means that potentially more

PM Events may be collected by ENM per ROP. For ENM PMIC storage scalability, EBS

processing capacity, and bandwidth considerations see ENM System Capacity

CPI.

The Trace Event Streaming feature allows streaming live cell

trace events through TCP socket connection to a customer node. When the performance

event data is streamed, each recording is handled as a separate data stream. With this

feature, the data is sent after every event occurrence.

Standardized events are Layer 3 protocol messages, which are stored as they appear on the

external protocol interfaces. They are stored in an ASN.1-encoded format that is

converted to a bit-packed binary format. By default, external event data is included in

the performance event data file, but can be excluded through configuration. All other,

nonstandardized events are proprietary and encoded in .gpb format. For more information

about Layer 3, see Transport Network Functions.

The ROP files are compressed using GZIP.

At Network Element restart, all cell trace recording ROP files are removed from the

Network Element file system.

### 1.6.4 Performance Events MOM

In the MOM, the performance event recordings for Cell Trace are managed in the

PmEventM MO class. Each performance event recording is represented by an

instance of the EventType MO class. PM events are grouped in the

EventGroup MO class but can also be used separately.

The start of a performance event recording is made in the OSS through

an event job. In the MOM, an event job is represented by an instance of the

EventJob MO class.

After a restart of the Network Element, the state of the event job is the same as before the

restart.

MOM attributes for UE Trace include the configuration of the UDP streaming port using the

PmEventService.streamPortPmUeTrace attribute, and events to be filtered

from all UE Trace jobs managed under the EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist

attribute. The general management of UE Trace jobs is controlled by the OSS provisioning of the job on the MME.

For detailed information about performance event recordings, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

## 1.7 Robust PM Handling at High Load on eNodeB

The probability of node crash in very high traffic load situations can be reduced by

configurable reduced observability modes.

In reduced observability modes some PM events or counters or other observability methods

are suspended, depending on configuration. This results in less effective observability

on the node. In reduced observability mode, the eNodeB does not provide events for the

following:

- Exception log
- Local event log
- UE trace and cell trace, depending on the reduced observability level
- Counters, depending on the reduced observability level Note: Counters that are not stepped due to reduced observability being active are marked as suspect in the ROP file.

Robust PM handling can be configured by the following MOM attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.obsMode
- ENodeBFunction.obsProtectionAutoTargetMode
- ENodeBFunction.obsStatus

The following counters can be used to monitor robust PM handling:

- ENodeBFunction.pmObsLocalEventDiscPmLoad
- EUtranCellFDD.pmObsLocalEventDiscPmLoad
- EUtranCellTDD.pmObsLocalEventDiscPmLoad

## 1.8 Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L)

The optional EBS-L application provides additional PM statistics produced from PM

events.

EBS-L is an OSS application that enables generating 3GPP compliant counter files off the

node. EBS-L provides more detailed PM statistics, for example Performance Event failure

causes as individual PM counters.

All EBS PM counters are fully integrated with the node and other PM counter handling

products (such as ENIQ-S). For example, the initiation of the RAN Performance Events

needed for EBS Performance Statistic production, is managed by the PM Initiation and

Collection (PMIC) application.

EBS counters are also known as OSS counters.

For detailed information, see the Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L)

chapter in the Network Impact Report in Ericsson Network

Manager CPI library and PM Initiation and Collection in

ENM Online Help CPI Library. The details are also available in

Ericsson Network IQ Statistics (ENIQ-S) CPI library.

For detailed list of EBS-L counters, see List and Delta Lists.

# 2 Performance Management Actions

The following procedures can be performed to user-defined PM

jobs:

- Creating user-defined PM jobs
- Starting user-defined PM jobs
- Modifying user-defined PM jobs
- Stopping user-defined PM jobs
- Deleting user-defined PM jobs

The predefined PM jobs that are included at delivery can only be started and stopped.

From the performance event recordings, only Cell Trace event jobs are managed at the Network

Element. The user defined Cell Trace event jobs can be modified, started, and stopped. The

predefined CCTR cannot be modified.

The following procedures can be performed to cell trace event jobs:

- Starting cell trace event jobs
- Stopping cell trace event jobs
- Modifying cell trace event jobs

The following procedures can be performed to UE trace event jobs:

- Starting UE trace event jobs
- Stopping UE trace event jobs
- Modifying UE trace event jobs

## 2.1 Create PM Job

Steps

- Create a new PmJob MO instance. Result: The PmJob.requestedJobState attribute of the newly created instance is set to ACTIVE by default. If multiple ROP files are configured, the PmJob.jobGroup attribute of the MO instance is set to one of the following values, based on which RAT it is valid for: GSM WCDMA LTE If the MO instance is not related to any specific RAT, its PmJob.jobGroup attribute is not set.

## 2.2 Start PM Job

Prerequisites

A PmJob MO instance for a PM job is created.

Steps

1. Create a MeasurementReader MO instance under the PmJob MO for each MeasurementType or PmGroup MO instance. Result: The PmJob.currentJobState attribute is set to ACTIVE which initiates performance statistics measurements. ROP files are created starting from the first complete result output period.

## 2.3 Stop PM Job

Prerequisites

A PM job is active.

Steps

1. Set the PmJob.requestedJobState attribute to STOPPED. Result: The system sets the attribute PmJob.currentJobState to STOPPED, which stops performance statistics measurements. If the measurement stops during a Result Out Period, no ROP file is created. Restarting a stopped PM job is done by starting a PM job.

Related Information

Start PM Job

## 2.4 Modify a PM Job

Steps

1. Add or remove one or more desired PmJob.MeasurementReader MO attributes that represent the PM job that is to be modified. The desired MeasurementType or PmGroup MO instances are referenced by the mandatory MeasurementReader.measurementSpecification MO attribute.

Results

The measurement result of the modified PM job is reported in the next ROP file.

## 2.5 Delete a User-Defined PM Job

Steps

1. Set the PmJob.requestedJobState MO attribute of the PM job that is to be deleted to STOPPED. Result: The PmJob.currentJobState attribute is set to STOPPED by the system and the measurement is stopped.
2. Delete the PmJob MO instance.

## 2.6 Create PM Job Groups

PM jobs can be grouped together into PM job groups to use a separate group-specific ROP file for measurements.

Steps

1. Set the PmJob.jobGroup attribute for each PmJob MO instance to be included in the PM job group to the same value.
2. Set PmSupport.ropFileHandling to MULTIPLE\_ROP\_FILES.

## 2.7 List PM Job

Steps

1. Use the show command in Ericsson CLI and EMCLI. It is possible to manually display the PM jobs associated with an MO instance. To do this, in the Ericsson CLI navigate to the MO instance and issue the show command. For more information on the show command, see Ericsson CLI.

## 2.8 Modify Cell Trace Event Job

Prerequisites

The events to be included or excluded and attributes that are to be changed are

identified.

Steps

1. Ensure that the value of the EventJob.requestedJobState attribute is set to STOPPED.
2. Set the EventJob.eventGroupRef or EventJob.eventTypeRef attribute to include events to be recorded.
3. To specify the cell or cells to record, set the CellFilter attribute to a list of Local Distinguished Names of cells, separated by semicolons.
4. To specify a fraction of the UEs in a cell to record, set attribute UeFraction to a value between 0 to 1000. A value of 500 means that 50% of the UEs in a cell is recorded.
5. To include or exclude the ASN.1 format of external events data, set the EventJob.EventFilter attribute.
6. Set the event producer, such as LRAT FileTypes=1:FileType.fileSizePercent attribute to a value between 1 and 100 to specify the percentage of the FileType.fileSizeMax attribute to be used as the maximum file size for the CCTR, High Priority, or Normal Priority file. Note: The FileTypes=1:FileType.fileSizePercent attribute is overwritten with the value provided by the event producer after a software upgrade. If the value is manually set to a value other than the default value set by the producer, the value must be manually set again after the upgrade to avoid PM event loss.
7. If the Streaming of PM Events feature is to be used with the stream destination provided as IP addresses, set the following attributes:
    1. Set the value of the EventJob.streamOutputEnabled to true.
    2. Enter the address of the server to which event data must be streamed in the EventJob.streamDestinationIpAddress attribute.
    3. Enter the server port to which event data must be streamed in the EventJob.streamDestinationPort attribute.
8. If the Streaming of PM Events feature is to be used with the stream destination provided as FQDNs, set the following attributes: Performance event ROP files are created also if streaming is used. To use streaming only, set the value of the EventJob.fileOutputEnabled to false.
    1. Enter the FQDN of the server to which event data must be streamed in the EventJob.streamDestination attribute.
    2. If the server port to which event data must be streamed is not already provided as part of FQDN as set in EventJob.streamDestination, enter the server port in the EventJob.streamDestinationPort attribute.
    3. Set the value of the EventJob.streamOutputEnabled attribute to true.

## 2.9 Start Cell Trace Event Job

To start a Cell Trace event job:

Steps

1. Set attribute requestedJobState TOOLTIPFLAG to ACTIVE. The NE first sets attribute currentJobState TOOLTIPFLAG on MO EventJob TOOLTIPFLAG to ACTIVATING, then to ACTIVE. After that, the recording starts.

## 2.10 Stop Cell Trace Event Job

To stop a Cell Trace event job:

Steps

1. Set attribute requestedJobState TOOLTIPFLAG to STOPPED. The NE first sets attribute currentJobState TOOLTIPFLAG on MO EventJob TOOLTIPFLAG to DEACTIVATING, then to STOPPED. After that, the recording is stopped. If the recording results are streamed, the streaming is stopped. If the recording results are saved in ROP files, the footer of the open files are written and the files are closed.

## 2.11 Preparing for UE Trace

The primary event filtering mechanisms for UE Trace are setting the trace depth and

interfaces to trace. These are configured when the UE Trace is activated.

### 2.11.1 Configure Custom Filtering of Events for UE Trace

This additional filtering can be used to remove high-frequency, non-UE-specific

events from all UE Trace jobs. This frees up resources for other events.

Steps

1. Configure the EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist attribute to enable additional filtering of specific events produced by the eNodeB regardless of the trace depth and interfaces to trace. The S1\_PAGING message is filtered by default. It is recommended to maintain the default filtering of S1\_PAGING in EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist.
    1. Use Lists and Delta Lists Baseband to identify high-frequency, non-UE-specific events with the following parameters: Event Type: RBS or Cell OSS protocol: INTERNAL\_PERIODIC OSS Event Group: UETR\_ONLY
    2. Add the names of some or all of these events to EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist using regular configuration management tools to reduce the trace scope. For more information, see Manage Lists and Lists and Delta Lists Baseband.

### 2.11.2 Configure Streaming of Events for UE Trace

Steps

1. Configure PmEventService.streamPortPmUeTrace on the eNodeB if UDP streaming is used as an output method.

## 2.12 Start UE Trace

For the activation of one or more events, the

user has to define a UE Trace subscription. A UE Trace subscription is an entity in the

OSS that helps users to manipulate event administration.

Prerequisites

The desired events to be produced by the network element must be considered

carefully. Any PM event can be filtered by adding the name of the PM event contained

in the EventTypeS.eventTypeSId attribute to the

EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist attribute.

The S1\_PAGING event is present by default in the filterlist. It is recommended not to

remove it and to always have it filtered.

Steps

1. Choose Subscription Type and choose the subscription type UE Trace recording subscription.
2. Enter a name to be associated with this subscription. Optionally, enter a user comment about the subscription.
3. Select Output Mode. The IP address of the receiving system must be entered if STREAMING or FILE\_AND\_STREAMING is selected.The NR managed functions do not support file and stream output in the same job. If FILE\_AND\_STREAMING is selected, the eNodeB provides both file and stream output, but the gNodeB-CU-CP and gNodeB-DU managed functions only provides file output.
4. Choose a trace type and the trace depth.
5. Enter the IMSI or IMEI or IMEISV number. IMSI is chosen by default. Choose one of the following RBS trace depths: Maximum Minimum Medium MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension Maximum and MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension trace depths include ASN.1 content for external events from the RBS. External events can also be captured at Minimum and MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension trace depths without ASN.1 content. The MME always provides Maximum trace depth.
6. Select Interface Types. Select the interface types to be traced for the eNodeB and the MME from the corresponding lists.
7. Set Subscription Scheduling. A user-defined statistics subscription can be defined as Scheduled, which means that the subscription starts at a specified point in time and stops after a specified duration.

## 2.13 Modify UE Trace

A UE Trace subscription can be suspended or resumed by changing the state of the

subscription in the OSS. If the UE Trace subscription is

active and it needs to be modified, it must be suspended first.

Steps

1. Set the state of the active UE Trace subscription to inactive to suspend the subscription.
2. Modify the subscription.
3. Set the state of the inactive UE Trace subscription to active to resume the subscription.

## 2.14 Stop UE Trace

A UE Trace subscription is stopped by changing the state of the subscription in the

OSS.

Steps

1. Set the state of the active UE Trace subscription to inactive to suspend the subscription.

Results

UE Trace is stopped.

## 2.15 Activate Flexible Counters

Steps

1. Create the filter MO PmFlexCounterFilter and configure it for filter parameters configuration for Flexible Counters. Configure one or more filter MO instances as enabled. Each filter MO instance must be different from each other. The validator prevents the same configuration from being repeated.
2. Activate a user-defined job for selected flexible counters. The collected values for sub flexible counters are stored in ROP files every 15 minutes.
