RAN Compute units are represented under the Equipment MO class by the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance.

Figure 1   Equipment MO

For more information about each individual MO, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

## 1.1 Lock RAN Compute Unit

Locking the unit is often part of the procedure to act on generated alarms.

Steps

1. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute for the related MO to LOCKED. Result: The traffic ceases on the unit. No new alarms are generated, and all earlier alarms cease. This does not include Transport Network (TN) modules. O&amp;M actions can be performed on the board, if the unit is still installed and included in the current configuration. The optical indicators indicate full maintenance mode. Refer to Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.

## 1.2 Unlock RAN Compute Unit

Unlocking the unit is often part of the procedure to act on generated alarms.

Steps

1. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute for the related MO to UNLOCKED.
2. Verify that the status of the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is ENABLED. If the unit is disabled, the FieldReplaceableUnit.availabilityStatus attribute contains details about the operational state. The optical indicators indicate that the unit is in operational mode. Refer to Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.

## 1.3 Restart RAN Compute Unit

Steps

1. Perform the FieldReplaceableUnit.restartUnit action.
2. Set the restartRank parameter. Table 1 Setting the restartRank Parameter for RAN Compute Units Type of RAN Compute Unit MO Use of the restartRank Parameter Status of the restartRank Parameter Baseband FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is in use. Streetmacro FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is in use. Radio Gateway FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is in use. Baseband R FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is not in use. Baseband P FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is not in use. Note: Only Baseband units support different restart ranks. If a Baseband hardware unit or a Streetmacro unit is suspected to be faulty, perform the restart with RESTART\_COLDWTEST to start a recommended hardware test on the unit. The following values are available for restartRank parameter: Values of the restartRank Parameter Description RESTART\_WARM Restarts the MO with the same software. The software is not reloaded from the disk. Compared to other restartRank values, the traffic is affected the least, faster and no hardware is reset. RESTART\_COLD Reloads the software from the disk, restarts the MO, and resets all hardware. Compared to warm restart, the traffic is more affected. RESTART\_COLDWTEST Reloads the software from the disk, restarts the MO, and resets and tests the hardware. Compared to other restartRank values, the traffic is affected the most.

![Image](../images/154_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.F33D/additional_3_CP.png)
5. Set the restartReason parameter.
6. Set the restartInfo parameter for logging reasons. The restartInfo parameter is an optional free-text field where extra information can be added. Note: The following characters are not allowed in the restartInfo field: &amp; (ampersand) &lt; (less than) &gt; (greater than) New line Carriage return

## 1.4 Hardware Inventory History Log

The Hardware Inventory History Log allows the tracking of hardware replacements and

reconfigurations. Reconfigurations are only detected for hardware units with a serial

number.

Hardware reconfiguration occurs when a hardware unit is moved from its current position

to another occupied position.

If a RAN Compute unit is replaced, the log is restored on the new unit.

The log contains the following information of the replaced hardware unit:

- Additional text, which contains information if a replacement or reconfiguration is performed
- Name of the MO instance representing the hardware
- Hardware product name
- Hardware product number
- Hardware product revision
- Hardware product serial number

The log is stored at rcs/saf\_log/HWInvHistoryLog.

## 2.3 Replace and Restore Baseband Node

Steps

1. Log on to the node from OMC. If it is not possible to log on to the node from OMC, refer to Emergency Recover Node on Site, section Replace Unit and Restore Node.
2. Perform data collection. For instructions, refer to Data Collection Guideline.
3. Verify the backup. The node is easier to restore from a backup after replacing the Baseband unit. For information about creating a backup manually, refer to Manage Software. Note: When the product data that is stored on the new, previously used MO Cabinet and the SCU are different, the alarm Enclosure Product Data Mismatch is raised. To resolve the alarm, see the document Enclosure Product Data Mismatch. For information about node integration, refer to Integrate Baseband Radio Node.
    - If no valid backup is available, create a backup.
    - If an appropriate backup is not available, replace the hardware and perform node integration.
4. Load the replacement Baseband unit with the backup and UP. For instructions on how to restore the replacement Baseband unit, refer to Emergency Restore Node from Backup on Site. Note: If the Baseband unit is restored off-site, logging on to the node is not possible until on-site installation is completed. For off-site Baseband unit restoration, the maintenance user and the LMT port are used. For instructions, refer to Emergency Recover Node on Site.
5. Bring the replacement Baseband unit to the site. If the replacement Baseband unit is not pre-loaded, bring a computer with the backup and UP.
6. Lock the unit that is replaced by pressing the maintenance button for more than 2 seconds, but less than 7 seconds. For more information about the maintenance button, refer to Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.
7. Replace the Baseband unit. For instructions, refer to Replace Baseband, Replace 19-Inch Baseband, and Replace 8U Baseband.
8. Wait until the optical indicator on the unit, with the label Operational is on.
9. Contact the OMC and verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If the O&amp;M communication is not re-established, refer to Emergency Recover Node on Site.

## 2.4 Replace Baseband R, Baseband P, or Radio Gateway

Steps

1. Lock the unit as described in Lock RAN Compute Unit.
2. Replace the unit according to the instructions for the unit type.

Package the NETCONF file into an ENM AP expansion project zip file.

## 2.6 RAN Compute Self-Test

The following units can run a restart rank cold with test to accurately detect and locate

hardware faults:

- Baseband 6621, Baseband 6631, Baseband 6641, Baseband 6648
- Radio Gateway R608
- Radio Processor 6337, Radio Processor 6339, Radio Processor 6347, Radio Processor 6353, Radio Processor 6355, Radio Processor 6507
- RAN Processor 6647, RAN Processor 6651, RAN Processor 6655, RAN Processor 6672
- Streetmacro 6705

The test can be initiated on-site or through the NOC.

The result of the latest test is stored in the

FieldReplaceableUnit.hwTestResult attribute. Based on the

attribute value, the operator can decide what action must be taken.

Table 2   Hardware Test Results

| Result Name     | Result Description          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| NO_TEST_RESULT  | No result is available.     |
| TEST_RESULT_OK  | The hardware is not faulty. |
| TEST_RESULT_CEF | Complete entity failure.    |
| TEST_RESULT_PEF | Partial entity failure.     |

Running a restart rank cold with test can prevent the

following scenarios:

- Replacing not faulty field replacement units because of alarm indicators and KPI degradation
- Sending not faulty hardware units to repair centers

The operator can initiate a restart rank cold with test using the following

interfaces:

Table 3   Hardware Self Test Processes

## 2.7 Capacity Allocation Policy

The capacity allocation policy allows manual control over the amount of RAN Compute

resources used in the node.

The capacity allocation policy is controlled with the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute.

If the value of the GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute

is set to SYSTEM\_SELECTED, the allocation of RAN Compute resources in

the node is controlled by the RAN Compute power savings function.

The capacity allocation policy is activated after the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute is set to any

value other than SYSTEM\_SELECTED and the node is restarted. After the

restart, the RAN Compute power savings function is overriden and the value of the

PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute changes to

DEACTIVATED.

If the capacity allocation policy is activated for a configuration where not all hardware

resources are used, all available RAN Compute hardware resources can be

used.

Single-Mode Configurations

The capacity allocation policy activation by setting the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute to the value

of CAPACITY\_PRIORITIZATION is supported on the following RAN

Compute groups for single-mode RAN Compute configurations:

- 5c
- 5d
- 6

The following NR variants are supported in single mode:

- TDD FR1 eCPRI for AAS
- TDD Radio CPRI
- TDD FR2 CPRI
- TDD FR2 eCPRI

If the capacity allocation policy is activated, all available RAN Compute resources

are used:

- Up to 4 x Capacity Module B for sub-6 on RAN Compute group 6b
- Up to 2 x Capacity Module B for mmW on RAN Compute group 6b
- Up to 2 x Capacity Module B for RAN Computer group 6a
- Full capacity of Capacity Module A for RAN Compute group 5c and 5d

For more information on single-mode configurations, see DU and RAN Compute Configurations and Capacity and Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.

Mixed-Mode Configurations

The capacity allocation policy activation by setting the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute to the value

of CAPACITY\_PRIORITIZATION\_TDD is supported on Mixed-Mode RAN

Compute units in RAN Compute group 6 on NR TDD FR1 eCPRI for AAS with any of the

following modes:

- NR FDD
- LTE FDD
- LTE TDD

For more information on mixed-mode configurations, see DU and RAN Compute Configurations and Capacity and Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.

## 2.8 Baseband Power Savings

Power consumption might be reduced on supported

RAN

Compute units when power saving mode is activated. Power saving mode

is activated on supported configurations when the Baseband power savings function is

enabled.

Baseband resource allocation

considers

the following

factors:

- Installed radio hardware
- Configuration parameters
- Capacity allocation policy
- Baseband power savings function

If the Baseband power savings function is enabled and the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute is set to

SYSTEM\_SELECTED, the system allocates the minimum amount of

Baseband

resources,

using the smallest possible capacity module. This applies to all configuration modes to

achieve the lowest possible

power

consumption. For more information on capacity modules, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

If the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute is set to any

value other than SYSTEM\_SELECTED, the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute overrides

the Baseband power savings

function.

The status of

the

function

is set to DEACTIVATED after the RAN Compute unit

restarts. For more information, see Capacity Allocation Policy.

If the Baseband power savings function is disabled and the

GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute is set to

SYSTEM\_SELECTED,

the system prioritizes Capacity Module B for each configuration mode when possible

to

attempt to achieve a low level of energy consumption.

The amount of consumed power can be monitored by the PM counters that measure power

consumption.

Prerequisites and Requirements for Baseband Power Savings

The Baseband power savings function is supported on the following RAN Compute

units:

- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 5 except Streetmacro 6705
- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 6

The

function is monitored and controlled by the

PowerSaving MO for all supported

RAN

Compute units.

Baseband configurations on standard capacity modules can only run in single mode for

the following RAN Compute units:

- Baseband 6641
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6339
- RAN Processor 6647

NR

and

LTE

configurations on high capacity

modules

can run in single mode or mixed mode.

The

RAN

Compute

unit must qualify as

supported

by

meeting

the requirements of the

configuration

related to Baseband power savings in DU and Baseband Configurations and

Capacity.

The following conditions must be considered to ensure that the function works

properly:

- The capacity for NR and LTE might be reduced when the function is enabled, and power saving mode is activated. For example, the maximum number of connected users or peak throughput might be reduced. For more information on the impact on capacity, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN and Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.
- When the capacity is increased for NR or LTE after power saving mode is activated, the Power Saving Capacity Limit Exceeded alarm is raised to avoid capacity degradation. A manual restart is needed to cease the alarm. Manually disabling the function prevents the alarm from being raised.

Baseband Power Savings Thresholds

Figure 4 shows an example of the Baseband

power savings threshold for the following CPRI configurations:

- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 5 except Streetmacro 6705
- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 6

For more information about the capacity, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Figure 4   Baseband Power Savings Threshold for RAN Compute Groups 5c and

5d, and

6

When power saving mode is activated on these RAN Compute

units, power consumption is not always lowered. Power consumption depends on

the

configuration.

RAN Compute units in NR or LTE

single-mode

configuration with Capacity Module B in RAN Compute group 5 use a

small amount of resources. Enabling Baseband power savings in these RAN Compute unit

configurations in RAN Compute group 5 does not increase power savings. For more

information on RAN Compute units and capacity modules in RAN Compute group 5, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

When power saving mode is activated on these

RAN

Compute units, power consumption is not always lowered. Power

consumption depends on the configuration. Some configurations do not allow for

higher

power savings even if the Baseband power savings function is enabled and power

saving mode is activated.

Enabling or Disabling Baseband Power Savings

If the PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingsEnabled attribute is set to

true and the configuration mode is supported, power saving mode

is activated on the node. If

the

PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingsEnabled attribute is set to

true and the configuration mode is not

supported when the node is started, power saving mode is not activated.

If the GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute is set to

the

following values, the Baseband power savings function is automatically disabled on

Baseband

units:

- CAPACITY\_PRIORITIZATION
- CAPACITY\_PRIORITIZATION\_TDD

The

function can be disabled by setting the

PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingsEnabled attribute to

false. If this attribute is updated manually,

the

value of the update takes effect after node

restart.

Checking the Power Saving Status

The PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute shows the status of

power saving mode on the following RAN Compute units:

- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 4 except Baseband 6621
- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 5 except Streetmacro 6705

### 2.8.1 Increasing or Decreasing Configuration with Baseband Power Savings

Configuration can be increased or decreased

by

adding or removing

capacity.

Increasing Configuration by Adding Capacity

When power saving mode is activated on a node, the configuration can be increased by

adding capacity while the node runs. If the increased configuration of the node

exceeds the Baseband power savings capacity limit, the Power Saving

Capacity Limit Exceeded alarm is raised on RAN Compute units. To

cease the alarm, see Power Saving Capacity Limit Exceeded.

If the Power Saving Capacity Limit Exceeded alarm is

raised on a NR or an LTE node, one or more of the following capacity limits are

exceeded:

- The number of unlocked cells
- The antenna bandwidth
- The number of carrier branches

If power saving mode is activated and configuration is increased by adding capacity,

a node restart is not always required on the following RAN Compute units:

- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 5 except Streetmacro 6705
- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 6

When more resources are added and unlocked than the configuration can support in

power saving mode, the Power Saving Capacity Limit

Exceeded alarm is raised. A node restart is required to update

the power saving status and uses more resources.

Decreasing Configuration

When power saving mode is deactivated and the node exceeds the Baseband power savings

capacity limit, the configurations can be decreased to activate power saving mode

for the following units:

- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 5 except Streetmacro 6705
- All RAN compute units of RAN Compute group 6

A node restart is required to activate power saving mode after the configuration is

decreased.

### 2.8.2 Disable Baseband Power Savings

Steps

1. Set the PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingsEnabled attribute to false.
2. Perform a node restart as described in Restart Unit in Manage Hardware Equipment.

Results

The PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute is set to

DEACTIVATED, and power saving mode is disabled on the node.

### 2.8.3 Enable Baseband Power Savings

The Baseband power-saving mode is disabled by default. If the node is reconfigured

with power-saving mode disabled, the function can be enabled again.

It is not recommended to enable power-saving mode for RAN Compute units in RAN

Compute group 5d that have intra-node carrier aggregation functions configured. This

is because intra-node carrier aggregation functions do not work if they are

configured on a RAN Compute unit from RAN Compute group 5d with power-saving mode

enabled.

Steps

1. Ensure that the configuration meets the requirements of the power-saving mode. Note: The system attempts to use a single Capacity Module C for small node configurations when the Baseband power savings function is enabled. The following information must be checked for Capacity Module C: If performance figures are possible If the number of carriers are within the limit If PUCCH capacity is set in accordance with the values for LTE configurations For more information, see the following documents: DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity Maximum Number of RB Pairs Used for PUCCH per DU and per Sector Carrier in FDD Maximum Number of RB Pairs Used for PUCCH per DU and per Sector Carrier in TDD Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN
2. Set the value of the PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingsEnabled attribute to true.
3. Perform a node restart as described in Restart Unit in Manage Hardware Equipment.
4. Check the PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute.

Results

The PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute is set to

ACTIVATED, and the power-saving mode is enabled on the

node.

### 2.8.4 RAN Processor 6672 Unit Capacity Reduction at High Temperature for Improved Resilience

When the temperature rises from high to performance-critical level in a RAN Processor

6672 unit, the Critical Temperature Performance Degraded

alarm replaces the Temperature High alarm, and the unit

starts operating at 75% processing capacity.

When the internal hardware in the unit is turned off as part of this capacity reduction,

there is a corresponding temperature drop in the unit. This temperature drop allows the

unit to continue operating longer. When the internal hardware is turned off, alarms for

any affected cell services are raised.

If the unit temperature continues to rise to service-critical level after the capacity

reduction, the unit is taken out of service. All internal hardware is turned off, and

the Critical Temperature Taken Out of Service alarm

replaces the Critical Temperature Performance Degraded

alarm. This results in zero processing capacity and alarms are raised for all cell

services.

If the unit temperature does not continue to rise to service-critical level after the

capacity reduction and drops down to normal, the unit resumes operation with full

processing capacity. When resuming operation with full processing capacity, any

previously turned off internal hardware are turned back on and the unit stops the

Critical Temperature Performance Degraded alarm. Alarms

for any restored cell services are stopped. Cell services in this case are restored

without an intermediate unit restart and do not affect other cell services.

It is recommended to connect radio units to RI port groups by configuration mode. It is

also recommended to map at least 50% capacity of the configuration mode to RI port group

2 to isolate which cells are affected by the reduced processing capacity. This ensures

that capacity degradation has a maximum hardware effect even at less than 100% capacity

configuration. When there is at least 50% capacity of the configuration mode mapped to

RI port group 2, the affected cells are on a subset of the configuration modes mapped to

RI port group 2.

## 2.9 Network Loader Upgrade

The Network Loader can be upgraded on the Baseband Radio Node using a USB memory

stick. As a result, the upgrade procedure during integration becomes faster.

If a Baseband Radio Node has a USB port, it is possible to upgrade the Network Loader to

the latest software version from a USB memory stick. The Network Loader package on the

USB memory stick is encrypted. Once the Network Loader package is downloaded to the

node, it is decrypted with the key loaded on the node in the factory.

# 3 Streetmacro

The Streetmacro unit provides the functionalities of a Baseband unit and an AIR unit.

The Streetmacro unit supports the 802.1X Authenticator function. For more information,

see Port-Based Authentication.

## 3.1 Add Streetmacro

Steps

1. Create a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the Streetmacro unit.
2. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute depending on where the Streetmacro unit is placed.
3. Create a reference in the MpClusterHandling.primaryCoreRef attribute to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the Streetmacro unit.

## 3.2 Replace and Restore Streetmacro Node

Steps

1. Log on to the node from OMC. If it is not possible to log on to the node from OMC, see Emergency Recover Node on Site.
2. Perform data collection. For instructions, see Data Collection Guideline.
3. Verify the backup. Note: The node is easier to restore from a backup after replacing the Streetmacro unit.
    - If no valid backup is available, create a backup. For information about creating a backup manually, see Manage Software.
    - If an appropriate backup is not available, replace the hardware and perform node integration. For information about node integration, see Integrate Baseband Radio Node.
4. Load the replacement Streetmacro unit with the backup and Upgrade Package. For instructions on how to restore the replacement Streetmacro unit, see Emergency Restore Node from Backup on Site. Note: If the Streetmacro unit is restored off-site, logging on to the node is not possible until on-site installation is completed. The LMT port and the Maintenance User are used for off-site logon. For instructions, see Emergency Recover Node on Site.
5. Bring the replacement Streetmacro unit to the site. If the replacement Streetmacro unit is not preloaded, bring a computer with the backup and Upgrade Package.
6. Replace the Streetmacro unit.
7. Wait until the optical indicator on the unit is on, with the Operational label.
8. Contact the OMC and verify that normal O&amp;M communication is re-established. If the O&amp;M communication is not re-established, see Emergency Recover Node on Site.

## 3.3 Streetmacro Self Test

Streetmacro units can run a restart rank cold with test to

detect and locate hardware faults accurately. The test can be initiated on-site or

through the NOC.

The result of the latest test is stored in the

FieldReplaceableUnit.hwTestResult attribute. Based on the

attribute value, the operator can decide what action must be taken.

Table 5   Hardware Test Results

| Result Name     | Result Description          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| NO_TEST_RESULT  | No result is available.     |
| TEST_RESULT_OK  | The hardware is not faulty. |
| TEST_RESULT_CEF | Complete entity failure.    |
| TEST_RESULT_PEF | Partial entity failure.     |

Running a restart rank cold with test can prevent the

following scenarios:

- Replacing not faulty field replacement units because of alarm indicators and KPI degradation
- Sending not faulty hardware units to repair centers

The operator can initiate a restart rank cold with test using the following

interfaces:

Table 6   Hardware Self Test Processes

| Interface   | Description of Process                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# 4 Configuration Methods for Baseband

## 4.1 Configuration Flow

The configuration flow consists of creating a configuration file template that can be reused

for multiple nodes and a site-specific configuration file by populating the template file with

site-specific parameters.

Template files can be created by using the Configuration Generator (automatic template

creation with the ECT or a plugin in the Auto Provisioning application of the ENM), or by

using the advanced configuration method (creation of new XML NETCONF files). The preferred

procedure is to use the Configuration Generator, and, if the required configuration is not

supported by the tool, to edit the template file with an XML editor. The preferred procedure

will be further referred to as ECT throughout the document.

With the ECT there is no need to understand the MO structure when preparing the template

files or the site-specific files. However, it is necessary to understand the MO structure for

maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.

For more information on configuration methods, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool. For more information on

configuration files, see Manage Configuration Files.

## 4.2 Configuring Baseband and Baseband R Units with the Basic Configuration Method

The ECT generates a NETCONF configuration file with the required MO elements based on GUI

input parameters.

For more information about the ECT, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool.
