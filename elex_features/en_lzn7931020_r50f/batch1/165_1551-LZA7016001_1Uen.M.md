# 1 Introduction

This document describes the operating environment requirements

on RBS 6000.

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide information on how the

operation environment affects the product.

## 1.2 Target Group

This document is written for all personnel involved in site planning

and installation. It is also intended for all maintenance personnel.

Personnel working on Ericsson products or systems must have the

training and expertise required to perform their work correctly.

# 2 Requirements

This section describes the environmental specifications regarding

requirements on indoor and outdoor equipment.

## 2.1 Outdoor Equipment

When planning a site the risk of atmospheric corrosion must be

considered. The key factors of the atmosphere for corrosion of metals

and alloys are the temperature-humidity complex, and sulfur dioxide

and chloride pollution levels.

For unsheltered positions, the corrosion impact is from dry and

wet deposition. Wet deposition includes transport by precipitation

and dry deposition denotes transport by any other process.

For locations near the coast salinity levels are a key factor in

corrosion. Deposition of chlorides in coastal areas is strongly dependent

on the variables influencing the transport inland of sea salt, such

as wind direction, wind velocity, local topography, wind sheltering

islands outside the coast, distance of the site from the sea. In,

some situations the corrosion effect by chlorides is extreme, which

is typical of marine splash or heavy salt spray.

It is also necessary to consider the high importance of chloride

accumulation on surfaces not washed by rain, especially in humid sites.

Surfaces that are sheltered and not rain-washed in marine atmospheric

environments where chlorides are deposited and cumulated can experience

a higher corrosivity category because of the presence of hygroscopic

salts.

### 2.1.1 Corrosivity Levels

This section describes the corrosivity levels, ranging from medium

corrosivity to very high corrosivity. The following definitions are

according to ISO 9223 2012.

- C3 - Medium Corrosivity Temperate Zone Atmospheric environment with medium pollution (SO2: 5 µg/m3 to 30 µg/m3) or some effect of chlorides, for example, urban areas, coastal areas with low deposition of chlorides. Subtropical and Tropical Zone Atmosphere with low pollution.
- C4 - High Corrosivity Temperate Zone Atmospheric environment with high pollution (SO2: 30 µg/m3 to 90 µg/m3) or substantial effect of chlorides, for example, polluted urban areas, industrial areas, coastal areas without spray of salt water or, exposure to strong effect of de-icing salts. Subtropical and Tropical Zone Atmosphere with medium pollution.
- C5 - Very High Corrosivity Temperate and Subtropical Zone Atmospheric environment with very high pollution (SO2: 90 µg/m3 to 250 µg/m3) and/or significant effect of chlorides, for example, industrial areas, coastal areas, sheltered positions on coastline.

### 2.1.2 Site Interference

To avoid interference from nearby equipment, the site needs to

be kept clear of metal objects, especially directly in front of the

antenna.

Consider the following:

- Avoid interference from reflecting objects like metal chains or metal ladders
- Avoid interference from equipment that generates electrical magnetic fields, such as diesel generators or air conditioners

### 2.1.3 Operating Environment

This section describes operating environment parameters for equipment

operation.

There are three operating environments for the equipment: normal,

exceptional, and non-destructive.

- Normal: Under normal conditions, all units function as specified.
- Exceptional: Under an exceptional environmental stress outside of normal operating limits, all units continue to function but with reduced performance or capacity. When conditions return to normal, the systems resume "Normal operation" status.
- Non-destructive: Under a non-destructive environmental stress beyond exceptional limits, no equipment function is guaranteed, and performance may degrade in an unspecified manner. However, the equipment still fulfills legal requirements and does not become hazardous to people. When conditions return to normal, no on-site intervention is needed to restore full performance.

For information on temperature and humidity levels for the equipment,

refer to the Description documents of the respective product.

## 2.2 Indoor Equipment

The operating environment for indoor equipment must be a temperature-controlled

enclosed location suitable for sensitive data and telecommunication

equipment, with very low levels of airborne particles.

The operating environment must comply with the following standards:

- IEC 60721-3-3 classes 3K3/3Z2/3Z4/3B1/3C2(3C1)/3S2/3M2, and
- ETSI EN 300 019-1-3 Class 3.1 except for the main unit operation temperature.

An appropriate installation location must have an adequate air

conditioning system that provides the installation locations with

the following:

- Controlled level of particles in the air, according to Table 1.
- Controlled air temperature, according to information found in the Description documents of the respective products.
- Controlled air humidity, according to information found in the Description documents of the respective products.

Table 1   Air Particle Limitations

| Particles            |   Maximum Value | Unit   |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Salt Mist            |             0   | cm3/m3 |
| Sand                 |            30   | mg/m3  |
| Dust (Suspension)    |             0.5 | mg/m3  |
| Dust (Sedimentation) |             1.5 | mg/m2h |

### 2.2.1 Operating Environment

This section describes operating environment parameters for equipment

operation.

There are three operating environments for the equipment: normal,

exceptional, and non-destructive.

- Normal: Under normal conditions, all units function as specified.
- Exceptional: Under an exceptional environmental stress outside of normal operating limits, all units continue to function but with reduced performance or capacity. When conditions return to normal, the systems resume "Normal operation" status.
- Non-destructive: Under a non-destructive environmental stress beyond exceptional limits, no equipment function is guaranteed, and performance may degrade in an unspecified manner. However, the equipment still fulfills legal requirements and does not become hazardous to people. When conditions return to normal, no on-site intervention is needed to restore full performance.

For information about the operating environment for the equipment,

refer to the Description documents of the respective products.
