# 1 Introduction

This document describes the basic functions of the Ericsson Command

Line Interface (CLI). Ericsson CLI is used to observe and manage the

Managed Element (ME).

For a complete description of the Ericsson CLI, including commands,

key combinations, error messages, character support, syntaxes, and

examples, refer to the embedded help, as described in Embedded Help.

## 1.1 Ericsson CLI Overview

Ericsson CLI is part of the administrative interface and a complement

to other management tools. It is a text-based Operation and Maintenance

(O&amp;M) client that provides access to the node and the Managed

Object Model (MOM).

Ericsson CLI provides a hierarchical view of MOM elements corresponding

to the MOM structure.

CLI command elements and their properties are defined in the MOM

as MOCs, attributes, and actions. The administrator configures, manages,

and maintains the node in the network by using the CLI client to manipulate

the Managed Objects (MO).

A secure connection is achieved using Secure Shell (SSH) or Transport

Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

# 2 Get Started

This section describes how to start and end a session in Ericsson

CLI.

## 2.1 Prerequisites

Before using Ericsson CLI, the following conditions must apply:

- The firewall must be configured to allow access to the SSH port. The value of the CliSsh.port attribute is 2023 by default.
- A standard Secure Shell version 2 (SSH v2) client must be available.
- A valid O&amp;M user account must be set up. For more information, see Manage User Access.
- When working on site, bring a computer, configure it, and connect it to the node as described in Connect Client.

## 2.2 Start a Session

A session can be started from an active Element Management Command Line Interface (EMCLI)

session or directly from a secure shell client.

### 2.2.1 Start a Session from SSH Client

Steps

1. Open a Linux shell or a Microsoft Windows Secure Shell (SSH) client.
2. Enter ssh &lt;ip-address&gt; -p &lt;ssh-port&gt; -l &lt;user&gt;. Table 1 Paramaters and Values to Start an Ericsson CLI Session Parameter Value ip-address If on-site and connected to the LMT port, use the default IP address 169.254.2.2. If off-site, use the node O&amp;M IP address. The OamAccessPoint.accessPoint attribute refers to an AddressIPv4 or AddressIPv6 MO instance. The node O&amp;M IP address is shown in the address attribute of the referenced MO. ssh-port Use the SSH-port shown in the CliSsh.port attribute. It is 2023 by default. user Use the user that is defined on the LDAP server.
3. When prompted, enter the password.

Results

A session is started in Exec Mode. The Ericsson CLI startup message and the Exec prompt &gt; is displayed.

CLI Modes

### 2.2.2 Start a Session from EMCLI

To start a session from EMCLI, enter comcli and press Enter. For more information on EMCLI,

see EMCLI.

When the procedure is completed, a session is started in Exec Mode.

The Ericsson CLI startup message and the Exec prompt &gt; is displayed. For more information on the CLI modes, see CLI Modes.

### 2.2.3 Start a Session As Maintenance User

If contact with the node has been lost, it is possible to log in

as a Maintenance user on-site using Ericsson CLI. For instructions,

see Emergency Recover Node on Site.

## 2.3 Unsuccessful Logon

Table 2   Logon Error Messages

| Error Message       | Recommended Action                                                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection refused  | Check the SSH port accessibility.                                              |
| Invalid Credentials | Get a valid pair of user accounts and passwords from the system administrator. |
| No route to host    | Check the IP address.                                                          |
| Permission denied   | Check if the user name is valid.                                               |

## 2.4 Session Inactivity Timer

The session inactivity timer ends a session if the predefined time

has passed without any activity. When the session inactivity time

starts, the system automatically stops ongoing transactions and ends

the session without warning.

If a session has been started from an SSH client, the session inactivity timer is 15

minutes.

However, if the session has been started from EMCLI the session inactivity timer is two

minutes. This timer can be reset to up to 15 minutes in EMCLI using command uv

comcli\_timeout=&lt;value&gt;. The time is set in seconds.

## 2.5 End a Session

To end a session, enter the exit command.

## 3.1 Embedded Help

Ericsson CLI gives online and context-sensitive help. It enables the user to access information about the commands, the Management Information Base (MIB), and the MOM.

Context-Sensitive Help

The command ? is used to request context-sensitive help. The content and the format of the printed help depends on the CLI mode, CLI position, and CLI input:

| Brief help   |    | The class, attribute, and action in the printout are displayed in a truncated form (one sentence only).  It is printed for all available elements if the context does not uniquely identify one CLI element.                   |
|--------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Verbose help |    | The descriptions of class, attribute, and action in the printout are displayed in a complete form including the text formatting characters (tab, new line).  It is printed if the context uniquely identifies one CLI element. |

Static Help

The command help provides static help for the Ericsson CLI. This command can be executed in Exec mode and Config mode.

The help information consists of an Ericsson CLI state diagram and a summary of the main commands. It also gives information on the key bindings in the Ericsson CLI. In the help information, the Ericsson CLI commands are classified based on their operation and the purpose for which they are used.

CLI Modes

CLI Position

## 3.2 Display CLI Version

Command version displays the Ericsson CLI version.

The Ericsson CLI version is described using three sequence numbers, &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;:

- The major number is incremented when a significant and non-backwards compatible change is made, for instance when a command is removed, or when the syntax or behavior of a command is changed.
- The minor number is incremented when a significant but backwards compatible change is made, for instance when a new command is added or when new options are added to an existing command.
- The revision number is incremented when a minor change that does not affect the described behavior is made, for instance when a fault that made a documented function unusable is corrected.

Example 1   Display Ericsson CLI Version

```
>version
Ericsson CLI 1.1.0
```

## 3.3 Managed Object Model

Each MO class contains a number of attributes that are used to

store configuration data or performance measurement data.

Each MO class can also support a number of defined actions. These

represent certain operations that can be performed by the MO. A typical

example is the action

createBackup

on the

BrmBackupManager

MO which creates a backup of the node software.

For information on the Managed Object Model (MOM), MO Classes,

MOs, and related concepts mentioned in this document, refer to Managed Object Model Description.

## 3.4 Attribute Types

In this section, the different types of attributes that exist in

the MOM are described.

### 3.4.1 Single-Value Attribute

Single-value attributes contain one value, as shown in Example 2.

Example 2   Single-Value Attribute

```
userLabel=ExampleName1
```

### 3.4.2 Structure Attribute

Structure attributes contain an arbitrary number of structure members

of the same or different type. Example 3 shows a structure attribute.

Example 3   Structure Attribute

```
RepairDeliveryNote
   countryCode="24"
   descriptionOfFault="HW fault alarm detected."
   preparedBy="Operator"
   reference="HW fault alarm"
   stateCode="S"
   timeDate="2014-07-03T15:41:37"
```

### 3.4.3 Sequence of Single-Value Attribute

A sequence of single-value attributes contains an arbitrary number

of values, as shown in Example 4.

Example 4   Sequence of Single-Value Attribute

```
stringMultivalueAttr
   "STRING"
   "SWEDEN"
```

### 3.4.4 Sequence of Structure Attribute

Sequence of structure attributes can have several instances. Each

attribute instance can have an arbitrary number of structure members.

The attribute in a sequence of structure can be with or without

key members. If the sequence of structure has key members, it is possible

to identify and address the attributes in the sequence.

Example 5 shows an example of a sequence

of structure attribute without key.

Example 6 shows an example of a

sequence of structure attribute with key.

Example 5   Sequence of Structure Attribute without Key

```
agentAddress
   host="1.1.1.1"
   port=111
agentAddress
   host="2.2.2.2"
   port=222
```

Example 6   Sequence of Structure Attribute with Key

```
agentAddress=1
   host="1.1.1.1"
   port=111
agentAddress=2
   host="2.2.2.2"
   port=222
```

## 3.5 CLI Modes

The Ericsson CLI provides the following two modes:

| Exec Mode   | Display the status of the Managed Element (ME). Enter commands to monitor the node, display its configuration, and execute actions.                         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Config Mode | Change the configuration of the ME. Starts a configuration transaction to the MIB. Enter commands to change the node configuration, and commit the changes. |

Configuration changes and actions are performed in transactions

in the Config mode. For more information, see Transactions. It is not possible to perform configuration

changes and run actions in the same transaction. If attempted, an

error message is returned and all changes are lost.

Depending on the CLI mode, different CLI functions and set of CLI

commands are supported with different parameters.

## 3.6 CLI Position

The available operations in the CLI depend on the CLI position,

that is, the position in the MO tree. The CLI position is expressed

in the prompt as the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the MO where

the operator is positioned.

The CLI position is a session property that can be changed by navigation

commands, similar to directory change commands in a file system directory

tree. The initial CLI position, when a session starts, is the root

of the MO tree. The following sections describe how to address an

MO, how to change the CLI position and how the CLI position effects

commands.

### 3.6.1 Address an MO

To address an MO using distinguished names as described in Table 3.

Table 3   Addressing an MO

| Distinguished Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) | Identifies an MO in relation to its nearest parent in the MO tree. The RDN is not unique and can be shared between several MO instances located under different parent MOs.  The RDN contains the MO class, equal sign, and MO identity.   For example:Log=AlarmLog   Log is the MO class and AlarmLog is the MO identity. |
| Distinguished Name (DN)           | A comma-separated sequence of RDNs which forms the name of an MO instance: not necessarily a unique identification within the node.  For example:LogM=1,Log=AlarmLog                                                                                                                                                       |
| Local Distinguished Name (LDN)    | Uniquely identifies an MO within an ME.  The LDN shows the hierarchy above the MO, within the MO tree of the ME.  For example:ManagedElement=1,SystemFunctions=1, LogM=1,Log=AlarmLog                                                                                                                                      |

### 3.6.2 MO Tree Navigation CLI Inputs

Table 4   MO Tree Navigation Inputs

| Input           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| show-mib        | Displays the MO tree below the MO of the current position.                                                                                                                                       |
| show-dn         | Displays the distinguished name of the MO at the current position.                                                                                                                               |
| RDN, DN, or LDN | Moves down in the MO tree to the desired MO position.  The distinguished name must start with a child MO of the current CLI position. Pressing TAB displays the list of the available child MOs. |
| up              | Changes the CLI position to the parent MO.                                                                                                                                                       |
| top             | Change the CLI position to the root of the MO tree above the ME.                                                                                                                                 |

Example 7

ManagedElement=1&gt; SystemFunctions=1,SysM=1

SysM=1&gt; up

SystemFunctions=1&gt; top

&gt;

### 3.6.3 Interpretation of Commands in Relation to CLI Position

The commands are interpreted in the context of the CLI position.

The attribute names, action names, and MOs are interpreted relative

to the MO of the current CLI position.

Example 8, Example 9, and Example 10 shows the same attribute

addressed from different CLI positions.

Example 8   Show command: in the Root Position

```
(config)>show ManagedElement=1,SystemFunctions=1,SysM=1,userLabel
```

Example 9   Show command: at the ManagedElement position

```
(config-ManagedElement=1)>show SystemFunctions=1,SysM=1,userLabel
```

Example 10   Show command: at the SysM position

```
(config-SysM=1)>show userLabel
```

## 3.7 Command Operations

Operations are applied in such way that all or none of the operations are executed. If the operations are successfully executed, no printout is provided. If the operation fails, an error message is displayed in the following format:

ERROR: &lt;generic\_error\_message&gt;[&lt;specific\_error\_message&gt;]

The following are the conditions for successful command completion:

- The user has the proper authorization.
- The command complies with Ericsson CLI syntax, including case-sensitivity for MOM-defined commands.
- The command complies with the constraints defined in the information model.
- The command complies with the semantic rules.

## 3.8 Access Control

The result of the commands that manipulate the MIB is subject to authentication and

authorization. If the user does not have permission to access an MO instance or attribute, the

operations behave as if the MO instance does not exist. For more information on authentication

and authorization, see

Manage User

Access.

## 3.9 Auto-Completion

Press the Tab key at any time to auto-complete

the partially entered information in the command line. If more than

one option for completion exists, all the valid options that match

the information are displayed.

Auto-completion is provided for valid MOs and attributes to which

the user is authorized. A unique match of auto-completion also triggers

case correction of one CLI command element at a time for the following

types:

- MOC Name
- Attribute name, struct name, and struct member attribute name
- Enumeration value, that is, enumeration member or literal name
- Action name
- CLI operation and parameter name
- Action Parameter Name

Case correction for string attribute values is not supported.

Table 5 lists and describes

different strings that can be returned during auto-completion.

In addition to Tab, the keys in Table 6 activate auto-completion

in the listed contexts if the partial name entered uniquely identifies

the name of the command or its parameter.

Table 5   Strings Returned During Auto-Completion

| Output   | Description                                                                                                      |

| "        | Indicates in Config Mode that a string attribute value can be specified in quotation marks.                      |
| ,        | Indicates that the MO identified by the RDN can have an attribute, a child MO, or an action.                     |
| <cr>     | Indicates that the entered input is valid by itself, and the operation can be executed by pressing the Enter key |
| <space>  | Indicates that more options are available if a space is inserted after the current input.                        |

Table 6   Keys that Activate Auto-Completion

| Key            | Description                                                                                                          |

| Enter (CR)     | Completes operation, attribute, action names, and DNs and if there is a unique match, executes the completed command |
| Equal sign (=) | Completes DN and attribute names if they can be followed by a = character                                            |
| Space ("")     | Completes command names that can be followed by parameters                                                           |

## 3.10 Transactions

Configuration changes are applied in Ericsson CLI transactions

that are started from Config Mode. In this section, the Ericsson CLI

transaction components, shown in Figure 1,

are described.

Figure 1   Ericsson CLI Transaction Components

### 3.10.1 Start

Ericsson CLI sessions start in Exec mode and are changed to Config

Mode by command configure. The configure command initiates a new configuration transaction

to the MIB.

### 3.10.2 Commit

The command commit validates the transaction and commits the changes if it is successful. If the operation is successful, the session returns to Exec mode without a printout. If the operation fails, an error message is printed.

If the argument -s is used, a new transaction starts in Config Mode after a successful transaction.

The command validate can be used before commit to verify that the entered changes are valid. It returns a printout with the result of the validation.

### 3.10.3 Abort

Command abort [-s] discards changes

entered in the transaction, terminates the transaction, and returns

to Exec mode.

Use argument -s, to start a new transaction

in Config Mode after a transaction is aborted.

### 3.10.4 Time-Out

To protect system resources, the transaction lifetime is limited

by the transaction inactivity time-out mechanisms. The transaction

times out if the server detects no activity in the transaction during

a system-defined period. When the transaction times out the transaction

is aborted, the transaction content is removed, and the MO operated

on is locked. If the transaction has timed out, close the transaction.

An error message is displayed if attempts are made to perform operations

in the timed-out transaction.

If the session inactivity timer occurs before transaction time-out,

the session is closed and the transaction is immediately aborted.

### 3.10.5 End

To return to Exec Mode from Config Mode without making configuration

changes, enter command end.

## 3.11 Character Support for Attribute Value String

The attribute value string supports the US-ASCII format. Strings

can include the escape characters shown in Table 7.

The Ericsson CLI is compliant with 3GPP TS 32.300 V9.0.0 for MO

name convention, which specifies illegal characters in MO names. Illegal

characters in MO names such as + appear

as ?? in the Ericsson CLI.

Table 7   Escape Characters in Strings

| Escape Character   | Description      |
|--------------------|------------------|
| \n                 | New line         |
| \t                 | Tab              |
| \”                 | Quotation        |
| \\                 | Escape character |
| \?                 | Question mark    |
| \#                 | Hash             |

If a non-escape character is escaped using backslash, the Ericsson

CLI returns an error message. More escape characters can then be added

later without the risk of them already being used in scripts and configurations.

## 3.12 Command History

Ericsson CLI keeps a history of the commands that have been run during the current session.

The history command can be used to view the history of the entered commands. Without parameters, it prints the command history of the CLI session in chronological order in a specific format. The -s (or --size) parameter specifies the size, and the number determines the number of lines to be displayed. The default value is 100.

## 3.13 Scripting

Ericsson CLI scripts can be created by feeding the Ericsson CLI

commands to and parsing the output from the SSH client. The SSH client

buffer size limits the amount of input and output text that can be

processed.

# 4 Configuration Management

Configuration management is to add and delete MOs and to read and

change configuration data stored in the MO attributes.

### 4.1.4 Displaying a Structure Attribute

Command show [-r] [-v] [&lt;DN&gt;,]&lt;attribute\_name&gt; displays attributes that are defined as structure as a set of their member attributes. The nillable attributes are displayed as ordinary attributes.

Example 13   Displaying a Structure Attribute

```
(SwVersion=CXP9023001/1-R3A714)>show administrativeDataadministrativeData
           description="N/A"
           productionDate="2014-09-25T14:03:28"
           productName="MSRBS"
           productNumber="CXP9023001/1"
           productRevision="R3A714"
           type="MSRBSv2"
```

### 4.1.5 Displaying a Member Attribute of a Structure

Command show [-r] [-v][&lt;DN&gt;,]&lt;attribute\_name&gt;,&lt;structure\_member\_name&gt; displays the specified member attribute of a structure.

Example 14   Displaying a Member Attribute of a Structure

```
(SwVersion=CXP9023001/1-R3A714)>show administrativeData, productNameproductName="MSRBS"
```

### 4.1.6 Displaying a Sequence Attribute

Command show [-r] [-v][&lt;DN&gt;,]&lt;attribute\_name&gt; displays all values of attributes that are defined as a sequence, also know as multi-value attributes.

Example 15   Displaying a Sequence of Strings

```
(config-ExMO=1)>show stringMultivalueAttrstringMultivalueAttr
          "STRING"
          "SWEDEN"
```

### 4.1.7 Displaying a Structure Sequence Attribute

Command show [-r] [-v][&lt;DN&gt;,]&lt;attribute\_name&gt; displays all structure attributes with their member attributes for attributes defined as a sequence of structures.

Example 16   Displaying a Structure Sequence Attribute without a Key

```
(Snmp=1)>show agentAddressagentAddress
           host="1.1.1.1"
           port=111
         agentAddress
           host="2.2.2.2"
           port=222
```

### 4.1.8 Displaying a Sequence Element of a Structure Sequence Attribute

Command show [-r] [-v][&lt;DN&gt;,]&lt;attribute\_name&gt;,&lt;key\_structure\_member\_name&gt;=&lt;key\_structure\_member\_value&gt; displays the selected sequence element if the structure contains a key member. If the structure does not have a key member, individual sequence elements cannot be displayed. An attribute that is defined as a key acts as the identification paramater for the structure.

Example 17   Displaying Sequence Elements of a Structure Sequence Attribute with a Key

```
(config-ExMO=2)>show -v multiValueStructWithIntIdmultiValueStructWithIntId=2
           capital="kol"
           id=2 <key>
           name="countryName" <default>
           population=0 <default>
         multiValueStructWithIntId=3

           name="countryName" <default>
           population=0 <default>
         multiValueStructWithIntId=1
           capital="delhi"
           id=1 <key>
           name="countryName" <default>
           population=0 <default>(config-ExMO=2)>show -v multiValueStructWithIntId=1multiValueStructWithIntId=1
           capital="delhi"
           id=1 <key>
           name="countryName" <default>
           population=0 <default>
```

### 4.1.9 Displaying MO Instance Information

Command show [-v] [-r][&lt;DN&gt;] displays information about the desired MO instance.

Example 18   Displaying MO Instance Information

```
(NodeSupport=1)>showNodeSupport=1
           release="R3A714"
           AutoProvisioning=1
           MpClusterHandling=1
           OnSiteActivities=1(NodeSupport=1)>show -vNodeSupport=1
           nodeSupportId="1"
           release="R3A714" <read-only>
           supportFunction=true <default> <read-only>
           userLabel=[] <empty>

           MpClusterHandling=1
           OnSiteActivities=1
              technicianPresent=NOT_PRESENT
```

### 4.1.10 Displaying PM Counters

Command show-counters [&lt;DN&gt;] [-j &lt;jobId&gt;] [-v] [-c &lt;counter&gt;] displays real time values of PM counters for an MO instance. The behavior of the command is analogous to the other show commands, but displays PM counters associated with MO instances instead of attributes. The command is only available if the ME supports displaying measurements through the CLI.

Example 19   Displaying PM Counters

```
(MeasObj=1)>show-countersMeasObj=1
             intCounterActive=123
             multivalueIntCounter
               12

```

### 4.2.4 Delete Value of a Single-Value Attribute

Command no &lt;nillable\_attribute\_name&gt;

deletes an attribute value.

Read-only attributes cannot be deleted. Attempts to delete a read-only

attribute result in an error message.

Example 21 show how to delete the

value of attribute userLabel of MO instance HwInventory=1.

Example 21   Delete Value of a Single-Value Attribute

```
(config-HwInventory=1)>show userLabeluserLabel=Label(config-HwInventory=1)>no userLabel(config-HwInventory=1)>commit -s(config-HwInventory=1)>show userLabeluserLabel=[]
```

   "ALABAMA"
   "ALASKA"
   "ARIZONA"
```

### 4.2.6 Add a Single-Value Element to Sequence

Command

&lt;attribute\_name&gt;=&lt;sequence\_element\_value&gt;

adds an element to the last position of a sequence,

as show in Example 23.

Example 23   Add a Single-Value Element to Sequence

(config-ExMO=1)>MultivalueAttr=[ALABAMA, ALASKA, ARIZONA](config-ExMO=1)>MultivalueAttr=FLORIDA(config-ExMO=1)>commit -s(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr
   "ALABAMA"
   "ALASKA"
   "ARIZONA"
   "FLORIDA"
```

### 4.2.7 Add Single-Value Elements to Sequence by Command Insert

Command insert &lt;attribute\_name&gt;[&lt;existing\_sequence\_element&gt;]=&lt;new\_sequence\_element&gt;

adds a sequence element before the selected value

of a sequence, as shown in Example 24.

Example 24   Add Single-Value Elements to Sequence by Command Insert

```
(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr
   "ALABAMA"
   "ALASKA"
   "ARIZONA"(config-ExMO=1)>insert MultivalueAttr[ALASKA]=FLORIDA(config-ExMO=1)>commit -s(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr
   "ALABAMA"
   "FLORIDA"
   "ALASKA"
   "ARIZONA"
```

### 4.2.8 Change Sequence Element

Command

&lt;attribute\_name&gt;[&lt;existing\_sequence\_element&gt;]=&lt;new\_sequence\_element&gt;

changes a sequence

element.

   "ALABAMA"
   "FLORIDA"
   "ARIZONA"
```

### 4.2.9 Remove Named Element from Sequence

Command no &lt;attribute\_name&gt;=&lt;sequence\_element\_value&gt;

removes a named element from a sequence, as shown

in Example 26.

Example 26   Remove Named Element from Sequence

```
(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr
   "ALABAMA"
   "ALASKA"
   "ARIZONA"(config-ExMO=1)>no MultivalueAttr=ALASKA(config-ExMO=1)>commit -s(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr
   "ALABAMA"
   "ARIZONA"
```

### 4.2.10 Remove All Elements from Sequence

Command no &lt;sequence\_name&gt;

removes all elements from a sequence, as shown in Example 27.

Example 27   Remove All Elements from Sequence

```
(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr
   "ALABAMA"
   "ALASKA"
   "ARIZONA"(config-ExMO=1)>no MultivalueAttr(config-ExMO=1)>commit -s(config-ExMO=1)>show MultivalueAttrMultivalueAttr =[]
```

### 4.2.11 Change Element in Sequence of Structure without Key

If an attribute is defined as a sequence of structure and the structure

has no key member, a sequence element cannot be identified. Thus,

adding an element to a sequence results in replacement of all the

existing elements to a single new element, as shown in Example 28.

Example 28   Change Element in Sequence of Structure without Key

```
(config-Snmp=1)>show agentAddressagentAddress
   host="1.1.1.1"
   port=111
agentAddress
   host="2.2.2.2"
   port=222
(config-Snmp=1)>agentAddress,host=3.3.3.3(config-Snmp=1)>agentAddress,port=333(config-Snmp=1)>commit -s(config-Snmp=1)>show agentAddressagentAddress
   host="3.3.3.3"
   port=333
```

### 4.2.12 Change Element in Sequence of Keyed Structure

If the attribute is defined as a sequence of structure and the

structure has a key member, then a sequence element can be identified

and the Ericsson CLI position can be changed in the sequence.

As a result, existing sequence elements can be changed and new

elements can be added without changing the existing element, as shown

in Example 29. The

key of the structure is the countries name.

Example 29   Change Element in Sequence of Keyed Structure

```
(config-ExMO=1)>countries=Sweden(config-countries=Sweden)>capital=Stockholm(config-countries=Sweden)>population=2000000(config-countries=Sweden)>up(config-ExMO=1)>countries=Norway(config-countries=Norway)>capital=Oslo(config-countries=Norway)>up(config-ExMO=1)>show countriescountries="Sweden"
   capital="Stockholm"
   population=2000000
countries="Norway"
   capital="Oslo"
(config-ExMO=1)>show countries=Swedencountries="Sweden"
   capital="Stockholm"
   population=2000000
(config-ExMO=1)>no countries=Sweden(config-ExMO=1)>show countriescountries="Norway"
   capital="Oslo"
```

### 4.2.13 Change Attribute Defined as Structure

Command

&lt;structure\_name, structure\_element&gt;=&lt;structure\_element\_value&gt;

changes a

structure.

If the structure property isExclusive is set, then setting one structure member means that all other structure

members are automatically undone. Navigating away from the MO can

only be done if all members of a structure inside the MO are set correctly. Example 30 shows how to change values in

a structured attribute.

Example 30   Change a Structure Attribute

```
(config-Snmp=1)>show agentAddressagentAddress
     host="1.1.1.1"
     port=111(config-ManagedElement=NODE06ST)>agentAddress,host="2.2.2.2", port=222(config-ManagedElement=NODE06ST)>commit -s(config-FieldReplaceableUnit=1)>show agentAddressagentAddress
     host="2.2.2.2"
     port=222
```

### 4.2.14 Structure of Sequence

A structure can have a sequence as its element. Initialization,

adding, and modifying values of such structure elements is similar,

as described in Add a Single-Value Element to Sequence.

### 4.2.15 Change Attribute Defined as Password

Changing an attribute defined as a password is handled, as follows:

- An encrypted password can be assigned to a password attribute by &lt;attribute\_name&gt;=&lt;attribute\_value&gt; .
- A cleartext password can be assigned to a password attribute by &lt;attribute\_name&gt;=&lt;attribute\_value&gt; cleartext. A password entered in cleartext becomes encrypted. This operation is one way, since passwords cannot be displayed in cleartext, but in encrypted form.

Example 31 and Example 32 shows how to change a non-encrypted

and an encrypted password. If the passwords do not match an error

warning is displayed: see Example 33.

Example 31   Changing Non-Encrypted Password

```
(config-LogPushTransfer=1)>password="dilbert" cleartext(config-LogPushTransfer=1)>show passwordpassword="FinB5O7CratAnl+J5g=Nxo"
```

Example 32   Changing Already Encrypted Password

```
(config-LogPushTransfer=1)>password="BifCy98F7xJ1Z"(config-LogPushTransfer=1)>show passwordpassword="BifCy98F7xJ1Z"
```

Example 33   Password Mismatch

```
(config-A=1)>myPassword=Enter myPassword:Repeat myPassword:ERROR: The inputs do not matchEnter myPassword:
```

### 4.2.16 To Change an Attribute Defined as MO Reference

Changing an attribute of MO reference type is the same as for a

single-value attribute with the following, special handling:

- The MO reference attribute value is a string that contains the LDN of the referred MO.
- The referred MO must exist.
- The class of the referred MO must be as defined for the MO reference attribute in the model.

### 4.2.17 Create an MO Instance Using Ericsson CLI

Using Ericsson CLI, MO instances are created in config mode. This means that the configuration changes are not applied upon entering the changes, only after a successful commit of the transaction.

Prerequisites

- Ericsson CLI runs in config mode.

Steps

1. Enter show &lt;RDN&gt; to check if the MO exists. If MO information is displayed, the MO instance exists. If the MO instance does not exist, an error message is displayed instead.

If the MO instance does not exist, do the following:

2. Enter the name of the MO instance. Result: Table 11 Possible Results of Entering an MO Instance Name Printout Description Action Error message The verification has failed against a constraint. Modify the DN to comply with the constraints and repeat this step. No printout The operation was successful and the Ericsson CLI position has changed to the new MO instance. The newly created MO instance and its parent are locked. Continue with the next step.
3. Press the Tab key to list the optional and mandatory attributes. Verbose help can be requested on single-value and struct attributes to determine if the attribute is mandatory and if it has a default value. Example (config-NtpServer=AServer)&gt;administrativeState ? administrativeState BasicAdmState &lt;LOCKED|UNLOCKED&gt; [optional] Locks or unlocks the operation of the NTP client function. This is a convenience function to permit some or all NtpServer instances to be temporarily locked without having to delete the object.

5. Set the mandatory and the optional attributes. Note: If the MO instance is created and the value of a mandatory attribute is not assigned, commit is not performed and an error message is printed. The error message lists the names of the mandatory attributes that have not been set. ERROR: Following mandatory attributes are not set for the parent (NtpServer=new): &lt;serverAddress&gt;.
6. Enter commit.

MO Naming Rules

### 4.2.18 MO Naming Rules

The MO naming rules are the following:

1. All ASCII characters in the range 32-126 are supported.
2. If the characters are entered in escaped hexadecimal format, that is, \XX, where XX is hexadecimal two digits, and in the range 32-126, they must be converted to real characters.
3. The exception to the rule in b is for restricted characters in MO naming attributes, that is, ,, =, CR, LF, +, &lt;, &gt;, #, ;, \, ", and *.
4. All other characters, including restricted characters, must be converted to lower case and kept as they are, for example, \AA must be converted to \aa and kept as it is.

### 4.2.19 Delete an MO Instance Using Ericsson CLI

Using Ericsson CLI, MO instances are deleted in config mode.

Prerequisites

- Ericsson CLI runs in config mode.

Steps

1. Navigate to the parent of the MO instance you want to delete.
2. Enter no &lt;RDN&gt;. Result: Table 13 Possible Results of Entering an MO Instance for Deletion Printout Description Action Error message The verification has failed against a constraint. Modify the DN to comply with the constraints and repeat this step. No printout The operation was successful. The deleted MO instance, its children, and its parent are locked. Continue with the next step.
3. Enter commit.
4. Verify the result: If the MO deletion failed, an error message with error reason is displayed. In this case, act according to the error indication. For example, if the user tries to delete a system-created MO, error message ERROR: Cannot delete system-created object is displayed. If no result message is displayed, the MO deletion succeeded. In this case, the Ericsson CLI position is not changed, the locks are released, and a new transaction is created automatically.

# 5 Executing MO Actions Using Ericsson CLI

Actions are used to trigger MO-specific operations. They can only be used when the Ericsson CLI is positioned at an MO instance that contains the action.

Actions can be executed in config mode and exec mode on existing MO instances. To minimize the risk of incorrect configuration of the system, it is preferred to use exec mode to execute MO actions. For this reason, it is also not possible to perform configuration changes and execute MO actions in the same transaction in config mode. If attempted, an error message is returned and all changes are lost.

The syntax of executing MO actions in Ericsson CLI is the following: &lt;action\_name&gt; [--&lt;action\_parameter\_name&gt;&lt;action\_parameter\_value&gt;] ...

Example 34

(Schema=2)&gt;export --uri sftp://user@10.64.88.91/tmp/ --password userpwd

## 5.1 Action Request

Command

&lt;action&gt; [--&lt;action\_parameter\_name&gt;

&lt;action\_parameter\_value&gt;] ... requests

action execution.

Press Tab after entering the action name

to list the available action parameters. Values must be specified

for mandatory parameters. If an action is run and the mandatory parameters

have not been entered, an error message is displayed with the missing

parameters listed. Action parameters defined as structure or as a

sequence multi-value attribute are not supported.

If the action is started from Exec mode, it is immediately started

after the request is entered. If the action is started from Config

mode, the action starts when the transaction is committed.

If the action is successful a print-out is returned, depending

on the value of the action returned.

If the action request is completed with error, then the error reason

is displayed as ERROR: &lt;error\_text&gt;

. For example, ERROR: No execute permission for action '&lt;action\_name&gt;'.

# 6 Terminal Properties

This section describes the terminal properties.

## 6.1 Terminal Types

Some aspects of how the Ericsson CLI interacts with the attached

terminal or terminal emulator can be controlled by setting the terminal

type. The Ericsson CLI recognizes all terminal types supported by

the management system, operating system, and also the following special

terminal types:

- dumb The Ericsson CLI acts as if there is no terminal attached, but acts as if a script is fed into it on stdin. No prompts are printed and the input command lines are not echoed back. Only the command output is printed.
- ossrc-eam The Ericsson CLI acts as if the attached terminal is a vt100, with the following exception: A vt100, as well as terminals and terminal emulators compatible with it, do not show the cursor when an input line reaches the end of the terminal width. Thus, the Ericsson CLI for most terminal types echoes an extra space followed by a backspace as an input line reaches this length. For terminal type ossrc-eam, these extra characters are not echoed.

The terminal type is set by assigning a value to the TERM environment variable in the environment where cliss starts. The SSH protocol allows TERM to be set, but the methods depend on the client

used.

## 6.2 Default Key Bindings

Apart from the standard line edition keys such as Left

arrow, Right arrow, Backspace, and Delete, the Ericsson

CLI supports a number of key combinations that can be used for editing

the commands.

Support for key bindings is specific for the terminal type. The

terminal settings override any key or key combination.

The Ericsson CLI is aligned with the Libtecla library, which defines

each key binding as follows:

- Ctrl Press the Ctrl key and enter the next key simultaneously.
- Esc Press the Esc key on the terminal followed by the next key, or press the Meta key simultaneously with the next key.

### 6.2.1 Moving Cursor

The key combinations for moving the cursor are shown in Table 15.
