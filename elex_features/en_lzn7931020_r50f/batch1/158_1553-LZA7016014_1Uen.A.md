# 1 Support System Overview

The support system hardware equipment is divided into the following categories:

- RBS 6000 support system
- Support units

A support system hardware unit might be represented under the Equipment MO

by the following MO instances:

- BatteryUnit
- Cabinet
- EcBus
- ExternalNode
- FieldReplaceableUnit
- HwGroup
- SupportUnit

For more information on the listed MOs, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

## 1.1 RBS 6000 Support System

In an RBS 6000 site, the support system hardware units are shared between the following

RATs:

- NR
- LTE
- WCDMA
- GSM

In standard configurations, one or more nodes are located in the Smart Site cabinet with

the following roles:

- The support system is controlled by the support system primary node.
- Other nodes with equipment located in the same cabinet are called support system secondary nodes. These nodes request support system services from the primary node.

If the primary node fails, the support system works in autonomous mode until a primary

node is available. A secondary node can be reconfigured into a primary node if needed.

For more informationnformation on the configuration of a primary node, see Configure Node as Support System Primary Role Node.

The system overview in Support System Overview shows the logical view of a

Smart Site cabinet with one primary node. The cabinet might contain additional secondary

nodes and support systems. Each node has its own management system to manage the node

and, in the case of a primary node, related support system.

Figure 1   Support System Overview

The ExternalNode MOs represent other nodes in the cabinet. Each

instance of the ExternalNode MO is configured with data from one of

the other randomly selected external nodes on the site. For secondary nodes, the value

of the ExternalNode.informationOnly attribute  is set to

true automatically. The informative attributes under the

ExternalNode MO are populated by the system for both primary and

secondary nodes and cannot be altered.

The support system contains the following hardware units that can be divided into support

areas:

- Climate hardware
- External alarm ports hardware
- Power hardware

The hardware units are all connected through the Enclosure Control (EC) bus.

Table 1   Support System Hardware and Functions

| Support Areas   | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Climate system  | The climate system consists of the installed climate units. The                                 temperature inside the cabinet is controlled by adjusting the speed                                 of the fans and the output signal to the optional heater                                 automatically.  Any unit that sends temperature information can affect the fan                                 speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Power system    | The power system consists of the installed power units. The supported                                 level of functions in the nodes depends on which power units are                                 installed.  The power system rectifies, converts, or directly distributes the                                 incoming power supply to DC voltage for the equipment of the                                 cabinet. It also includes battery support to be able to supply DC                                 voltage to the equipment even if the incoming power supply is low or                                 missing. |
| External alarms | External alarms can be issued by external equipment connected to the                                 Support Control Units (SCU), Support Alarm Units (SAU), or external                                 radios. The external alarms are configured through the nodes to                                 which these units are connected. For more information on external                                 alarms, see Manage Faults.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 1.2 Support Units

Parts of the support system hardware, called support units, do not need operator-provided

configuration. The support units are still relevant to supervise and to include in

inventory service, but they operate autonomously. These units are not part of a resource

pool but provide their services, such as cooling and power, directly to the consuming

units, also called host units.

MOM representation for support units is auto-created at detection. The support units are

modeled using the SupportUnit MO. A host unit represented by the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO uses the

FieldReplaceableUnit.supportUnitRef attribute to reference its

SupportUnit MOs.

The support unit firmware can be upgraded remotely for the support units that have the

capability of firmware upgrade. The following auto-created MOs are used to support this

function:

- ExternalUpManager
- FwSlot

# 2 Support System Configuration

## 2.1 Lock Unit

Locking the unit is often a step of resolving alarms.

Steps

1. Set the administrativeState attribute for the related MO to LOCKED. Table 2 Units and Related MOs Type of Unit Related MOs Support system unit FieldReplaceableUnit Support unit SupportUnit Result: Traffic ceases on support units. All alarms raised on the unit cease, and no new alarms are raised. This does not include Transport Network modules. O&amp;M actions can be performed on the board if the unit is still installed and included in the current configuration. The optical indicators indicate full maintenance mode. For more information, see Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.

## 2.2 Unlock Unit

Unlocking the unit is often a step of resolving alarms.

Steps

1. Set the value of the administrativeState attribute for the related MO to UNLOCKED. Table 3 Units and Related MOs Type of Unit Related MOs Support system unit FieldReplaceableUnit Support unit SupportUnit
2. Verify that the value of the operationalState attribute for the related MO is ENABLED. Note: If the unit is disabled, the availabilityStatus attribute contains details about the operational state. The optical indicators indicate that the unit is in operational mode. For more information, see Indicators, Buttons, and Switches.

## 2.3 Restart Unit

Steps

1. Perform the restartUnit action for the related MO. Table 4 Units and Related MOs Type of Unit Related MOs Support system unit FieldReplaceableUnit Support unit SupportUnit Note: The restart action only works for support units with the capability to restart. The action is rejected for support units without the capability to restart.
2. Configure the restartReason attribute.
3. Configure the restartInfo attribute for logging reasons. The restartInfo attribute is an optional free-text field where extra information can be added. Note: The following characters are not allowed in the restartInfo field: ; (semicolon) &amp; (ampersand) &lt; (less than) &gt; (greater than) New line Carriage return

## 2.4 Add Support System Unit

It is always the primary node that controls the support system; all

configurations must be performed in the primary node.

Table 5   Field Replaceable Units and Required MOs

| Support Alarm Unit (SAU)       | N/A                                                                         |
| Battery Protocol Adapter (BPA) | BatteryBackup                                                               |

Add Support System Unit Automatically

Adding a support system unit automatically is done by the auto-detect and auto-create

system functionality. Support system unit MOs are automatically created when

additional units are connected or detected on the EC bus, compared to what the

configuration states. The configuration is automatically updated with the extra

units and they are fully taken into operation in power and climate control.

Add Support System Unit Manually

If the FieldReplaceableUnit MOs corresponding to the hardware

units in Table 5 are created with the

EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set

to true, product data can be found in the

FieldReplaceableUnit.productData attribute.

If the FieldReplaceableUnit MOs are created with the

EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set

to false, there is no product data since the hardware unit is not

identified.

Steps

1. Create an instance of the FieldReplaceableUnit MO under the Equipment MO with a unique FieldReplaceableUnit.fieldReplaceableUnitId attribute .
2. Create an EcPort MO as a child to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
3. Set the EcPort.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the unit is connected to. Depending on the unit, the following options are available: If the unit is an SCU or a support system, the EcPort.hubPosition attribute must be set to NA. If the unit is an SAU, the EcPort.hubPosition attribute must be set to SAU. If the unit is a climate unit, the EcPort.hubPosition attribute must be set to CLU.
4. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute to the cabinet where the unit is placed.
5. Configure the EcPort.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EC bus to which the EC port is connected. To add a BFU, a PDU, a PSU, an SCU, an SAU, or a BPA, create the relevant functional MO classes listed in Table 5.

Example 1   Adding BFU, PDU,

PSU, SCU, SAU, BPA or EMU

             </FieldReplaceableUnit>
```

### 2.4.1 Auto-Created Hardware Units

The auto-create and auto-detect system functionality provides the following:

- Automatic detection of support system units
- Automatic configuration of support system units
- Automatic creation of support system unit MOs when additional units are connected or detected on the EC bus, compared to what the configuration states

The configuration is automatically updated with the extra units, which are fully taken

into operation in power control and climate control.

The auto-detect and the auto-create system functionality detects and creates connections

from connected SCU, BPA, PSUs, PDUs, and BFUs in an SHU automatically. The

auto-detection and auto-creation system functionality describes how to detect a Support

System hardware unit automatically and represent it as an MO instance visible to the

OSS.

For some MOs and multi-cabinet configurations with one

EC-bus, manual configurations steps are necessary during node

commissioning and node integration. For example binding of SCU PID to a

Cabinet MO instance. If this manual step is not performed an

alarm is raised and the system support unit executes in autonomous or safety mode.

In the case of SCU with the product name SUP 6601, the node automatically

identifies itself as RBS 6601 and auto-corrects any cabinet product data mismatch. No

manual intervention is needed and no alarm is raised.

This feature needs that there is at least one cabinet and one

EcBus MO available for it to function.

### 2.4.2 Auto-Created and Auto-Detected External Nodes

When unconfigured external nodes are detected, the

EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute

enables the auto-detection and auto-creation of external nodes. Nodes connected over an

EC bus and through CPRI are affected.

On the primary side, an ExternalNode MO is auto-created when an

unknown secondary node connects. On the secondary side, the

ExternalNode MO classes are auto-created when an Inter-Node

Communication Interface connection is successful.

## 2.5 Configure Multiple Support Systems in Cascaded Chain

Support system units can be configured in a cascaded chain. The cascading order is defined

by the EcPort.cascadingOrder attribute. In the first support system, the

EcPort.cascadingOrder is set to 1, in the second

support system to 2, and so on.

The EcPort.cascadingOrder attribute must be set to a cascaded

configuration for RBS 6601.

The EcPort.cascadingOrder attribute must refer to a

FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance if the Baseband units are connected to

cascaded SUPs.

The EcPort.hubPosition attribute for

FieldReplaceableUnit MOs with unitType=SUP represent the hub port, to

which the other support system is connected. For more information on hub positions, see

Non-RF Connections for RBS 6601.

Steps

1. Configure the EcPort.cascadingOrder attribute for the FieldReplaceableUnit MOs withunitType=SUP and Baseband unit.

## 2.6 Support System Roles

A node can be categorized according to the following roles:

- Support system primary role node
- Support system secondary role node
- Support system multiple roles node

The choice of support system primary role node from the available nodes is decided by the

operator. A support system primary role node has the

EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set to

TRUE. For support system secondary role nodes this attribute is set

to FALSE.

In the MOM structure, the other nodes in the cabinet are represented by the

ExternalNode MO. In a support system primary role node,one

ExternalNode MO represents secondary role nodes. In a support

system secondary role node, there is one ExternalNode MO for each

support system primary role node that this node is connected to, and a number of

optional ExternalNode MOs that represent other support system

secondary role nodes.

In the Equipment view of the Element

Manager, the EquipmentSupportFunction MOs and the

ExternalNode MOs are included in the

Cabinet folder. It is possible to see which other nodes use

the same cabinet and support system.

The following attributes are used to identify hardware units and cabinets:

- Cabinet.cabinetIdentifier
- Cabinet.productData
- FieldReplaceableUnit.productData

The support system primary role node collects this hardware information.

### 2.6.1 Configure Node as Support System Primary Role Node

This procedure is used when several nodes are installed in the same cabinet, or share a

support system. The primary node controls the support system, therefore, all configurations

must be performed in the primary node.

Steps

1. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute to true.
2. Create an EcBus MO and set the EcBus.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that represents the processing unit to which the EC bus in the cabinet is connected.
3. Create a Cabinet MO.
4. Configure support system FieldReplaceableUnit MOs for SCU if the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateUnits attribute is set to true and only one instance of the EcBus and the Cabinet MOs exist. If applicable CLU, with the Cabinet.positionRef reflecting the cabinet where the units are placed. The system is auto-create detected support system FieldReplaceableUnit and their child EcPort MO connected to the EC bus.
5. Create the EcPort MO as a child to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
6. Configure all support system FieldReplaceableUnit MOs with Cabinet.positionRef attributes reflecting the cabinet where the units are placed.
7. Create an EcPort MO as a child to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO, with the EcPort.hubPosition attribute values reflecting the actual hub position used when connecting the unit. The EcPort.ecBusRef attribute must also be referring to the EC bus to which the EC port is connected.
8. Configure the Cabinet.productData attribute. Functional MOs, such as Climate and PowerSupply, must be created and related to a cabinet according to what type of equipment is allocated to that cabinet. For more information on the configurations of the support system units, see Add Support System Unit. For more information on the configuration of the climate system, see Configure Climate System and Climate System Variants. For cabinets supporting thermosiphon, Direct Air Cooling (DAC) climate systems, or Heat Exchanger (HEX), the Cabinet.climateRegulationSystem attribute must also be configured according to the available climate system. For cabinets where thermosiphon, DAC, or HEX is not available, set the Cabinet.climateRegulationSystem attribute to NOT\_APPLICABLE.
9. Choose a Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute that is matched later in the secondary node for multicabinet configurations.
10. Configure the following attributes to connect the climate system and power system MOs to a cabinet: Climate.controlDomainRef PowerSupply.controlDomainRef PowerDistribution.controlDomainRef BatteryBackup.controlDomainRef
11. Set the value of the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute to true.

### 2.6.2 Configure Node as Support System Secondary Role Node

Steps

1. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute to FALSE.
2. Create a Cabinet MO.
3. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute to TRUE.
4. Create an EcBus MO and set the EcBus.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to the processing unit to which the EC bus is connected in the cabinet.
5. Create an EcPort MO as a child to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the Baseband unit.
6. Set the EcPort.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the node is connected to.
7. Configure the EcPort.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EC bus to which the EC port is connected.
8. Set the Climate.controlDomainRef attribute to connect the climate system to the cabinet.
9. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute for all FieldReplaceableUnit MOs to the cabinet where the units are placed.

### 2.6.3 Configure Node as Support System Secondary Role Node, Connected to Multiple Primary Role Nodes

This section contains the manual configuration of a secondary node that is connected

to two primary nodes.

The configuration can be done automatically through auto-integration.

Steps

1. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute to FALSE.
2. Create the required number of Cabinet MOs.
3. Set the sharedCabinetIndentifier attributes so that they match with the MO of the sharedCabinetIdentifier attributes in the corresponding support system primary node.
4. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute to TRUE.
5. Create an EcBus MO and set the EcBus.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to the processing unit to which the EC bus is connected in the cabinet.
6. Create an EcPort MO as a child to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the processing unit.
7. Set the EcPort.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the node is connected to.
8. Configure the EcPort.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EC bus to which the EC port is connected.
9. Set the Climate.controlDomainRef attribute to connect the climate system to the cabinet.
10. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute to the cabinet where the units are placed.
11. To add more primary nodes, repeat steps from to Step 10 for the primary nodes in the other cabinets.

### 2.6.4 Configure Node as Support System Multiple Roles Node

Steps

1. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute to TRUE.

Perform the following steps for the cabinets where the node is set to be a

primary role node after the configuration:

2. Create a new Cabinet MO to represent this cabinet.
3. Set the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute on the new Cabinet MO to match the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute in the corresponding Cabinet MOs in other nodes.
4. Create a FieldReplaceableUnit MO for the processing unit that is used to connect to the EC bus in this cabinet if it is not already created.
5. Create a new EcBus MO representing the EC bus in this cabinet. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to point to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO created in Step 4.
6. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute to TRUE.
7. Verify that the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateUnits attribute is set to TRUE to enable the auto-create and auto-detect functionality. Support system units are automatically detected and configured when the functionality is enabled. If it is not enabled, the operator must configure the MOs. This also creates FieldReplaceableUnit MOs representing support system units and their corresponding functional MOs.
8. Create a second EquipmentSupportFunction MO with the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set to FALSE. This EquipmentSupportFunction MO represents the secondary role of this node.

Perform the following steps for the cabinets where this node is a secondary

node:

9. Create a new Cabinet MO representing the cabinet.
10. Set the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute on the new Cabinet MO to match with the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute in the corresponding Cabinet MOs in other nodes.
11. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute to TRUE.
12. Create an EcBus MO and set the EcBus.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to the processing unit to which the EC bus in the cabinet is connected. At creation, set the EquipmentSupportFunction.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute to point to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the secondary role.
13. Create an EcPort MO as a child to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the processing unit.
14. Set the EcPort.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the node is connected to.
15. Configure the EcPort.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EC bus to which the EC port is connected.
16. Create a Climate MO under the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the secondary role. Set the Climate.controlDomainRef attribute to connect the climate system to the cabinet.
17. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute for all FieldReplaceableUnit MOs to the cabinet where the units are placed.

### 2.6.5 Reconfigure Node from Support System Primary Role to Support System Secondary Role

Steps

1. Select the support system primary node.
2. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute to FALSE. Note: Reconfiguring a support system primary node to a support system secondary node takes effect immediately. There is no need to restart the node, as the operation does not disturb node traffic or require on-site intervention. The procedure is not applicable in case of multiple role nodes once both roles are defined.

### 2.6.6 Reconfigure Node from Support System Secondary Role to Support System Primary Role

The procedure is not applicable for multiple role nodes once both roles are defined.

Steps

1. Select the support system secondary node.
2. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute to true.
3. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateExternalNodes attribute to TRUE. For more information, see Configure Node as Support System Primary Role Node. For more information on configurations of the support system units including power supply, see Add Support System Unit. For more information on the configurations of the climate system, see Configure Climate System and Climate System Variants. For more information on configurations of external alarms, see Configure Climate System and Climate System Variants.
4. If applicable, set up the PM counters of the EnergyMeasurement MO on the new primary node. For more information on configurations of the EnergyMeasurement MO, see Configure Energy Measurements.

### 2.6.7 Reconfigure Node from Support System Primary Role to Support System Multiple Roles

The procedure depends on the initial configuration and the target configuration.

Steps

1. Set the EquipmentSupportFunction.autoCreateUnits attribute to FALSE. If the auto-create and auto-detect functions are activated, it is recommended to deactivate them temporarily when the role of the node is changed on an EC bus. See Step 3 and Step 6.
2. Create a second EquipmentSupportFunction MO, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to FALSE.
3. Delete all FieldReplaceableUnit MOs representing support system units that are controlled by this node, but are set to be controlled by another node after the reconfiguration.
4. Delete all ExternalNode MOs representing nodes that are configured as secondary to this node, but are not intended to be anymore after the reconfiguration.
5. Delete the functional MOs under the first EquipmentSupportFunction MO where the EquipmentSupportFunction.controlDomainRef attribute points to any of these Cabinet MOs if this node is the primary role node in cabinets where it is intended to be a secondary role node after the reconfiguration.
6. Change the EcBus.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute on all EcBus MOs representing an EC bus where this node is the primary node, but is reconfigured as secondary. Set it to point to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO with the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set to FALSE, created in Step 2.

Perform the following steps for the cabinets where the node is connected after

the reconfiguration, but is not connected before the reconfiguration:

7. Create a new Cabinet MO representing this cabinet.
8. Set the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute so that it matches the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute in the corresponding Cabinet MOs in other nodes.
9. If this node is connected to the EC bus in this cabinet, create new EcBus MOs representing that bus in this cabinet. At creation, set the EcBus.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to point to the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that is used to connect to that bus. At creation, set the EcBus.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute to point to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO matching the role this node has in the new cabinet.
10. If this node is connected to this EC bus and is secondary on it, create an EcPort MO as a child to the new FieldReplaceableUnit MO. Set the EcPort.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EcBus MO that is just created. Set the EcPort.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the unit is connected to.
11. Create a new Climate MO under the newly created EquipmentSupportFunction MO for all of the Cabinet MOs that this node is secondary in after the reconfiguration. Set the Climate.controlDomainRef of these new Climate MOs to point to each of these new Cabinet MOs.
12. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute for all FieldReplaceableUnit MOs to the Cabinet MO where each unit is placed.
13. Reactivate the auto-create and auto-detect function, if they are deactivated in Step 1. Result: Support system units are automatically detected and configured.

### 2.6.8 Reconfigure Node from Support System Secondary Role to Support System Multiple Roles

The procedure depends on the initial configuration and the target configuration.

Steps

1. The deactivate auto-detection and auto-creation of the ExternalNode MO.
2. Create a second EquipmentSupportFunction MO, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to TRUE.
3. If this node is a secondary node in the cabinets where it is changed to a primary node, delete the functional MOs under the first EquipmentSupportFunction MO where the EquipmentSupportFunction.controlDomainRef attribute points to any of these Cabinet MOs.
4. Change the EcBus.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute on all EcBus MOs representing an EC bus where this node is a secondary node, but is later to be the primary node. Set it to point to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO with the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set to TRUE, created in Step 2.
5. Change the ExternalNode.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute on all ExternalNode MOs representing nodes in a cabinet where this node is secondary, but is later to be primary. Set it to point to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO with the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute set to TRUE, created in Step 2.

Perform the following steps for the cabinets where the node is connected after

the reconfiguration, and it was not connected before the reconfiguration:

6. Create a new Cabinet MO representing this cabinet.
7. Set the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute on the new Cabinet MO so that it matches with theCabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute in corresponding Cabinet MOs in other nodes.
8. If this node is connected to the EC bus in this cabinet, create a new EcBus MO representing that bus. At creation, set the EcBus.ecBusConnectorRef attribute to point to the PlugInUnit or theAuxPlugInUnit MO representing the unit that is used to connect to that bus. At creation, set the EcBus.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute to point to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO matching the role this node has in the new cabinet.
9. If this node is connected to the EC bus in this cabinet and is secondary on it, create an EcPort MO as a child to the PlugInUnit or the AuxPlugInUnitMO used in the previous step. Set theEcBbus.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EcBbus MO that is just created. Set the EcBbus.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the unit is connected to.
10. Create a new Climate MO under the first EquipmentSupportFunction MO for all of the Cabinet MOs that this node is secondary in. Set the Climate.controlDomainRef of these new Climate MOs to point to each of these newCabinet MOs.
11. Set all the PlugInUnit.positionRef and the AuxPlugInUnit.positionRef attributes to the Cabinet MO where each unit is placed.
12. The auto-detect and auto-create functionality automatically detects and configures support system units and related functional MOs for the primary role node on the new EquipmentSupportFunction MO.
13. Activate the auto-detection and auto-creation of the ExternalNode MO.

### 2.6.9 Configure External Node for Other Secondary Nodes

These steps are valid only for support system secondary role nodes.

It is optional to perform the following steps. However, it is recommended to create

ExternalNode MOs for each external node in the cabinets, to

get better visibility of the nodes.

Steps

1. Create an ExternalNode MO indtance representing secondary nodes, connected to a common primary node. Note: For support system multiple role nodes, set the ExternalNode.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute manually at creation to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the secondary role, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to false.

### 2.6.10 Configure External Node through EC Bus

This chapter describes the configuration process for both primary and secondary role

nodes. For support system primary role nodes, perform steps from Step 1 to Step 3. For for the support

system secondary role node, perform Step 4.

Steps

Perform the following steps on the support system primary role node.

1. Create an ExternalNode MO instance representing each support system secondary node connected to the current support system primary node. Note: For support system multiple role nodes, set the ExternalNode.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute manually at creation to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the primary role, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to true.
2. Create an EcPort MO as a child to the ExternalNode MO. Set the EcPort.hubPosition attribute to the hub port that the external node is connected to.
3. Configure the EcPort.ecBusRef attribute to refer to the EC bus to which the EC port is connected.

Optionally perform the following steps on the support system secondary role node

to get better visibility of the nodes:

4. Create an ExternalNode MO instance representing each connected support system primary role node. Note: For support system multiple role nodes, set the ExternalNode.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute manually at creation to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the secondary role, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to false.

### 2.6.11 Configure External Node through CPRI

Steps

1. Create an ExternalNode MO.
    - For support system primary nodes, create an ExternalNode MO instance representing each support system secondary node connected to this primary role node. For support system multiple role nodes, set the EquipmentSupportFunction.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute manually at creation to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the primary role, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to true.
    - For support system secondary nodes with inter-node connectivity, create an ExternalNode MO instance representing the connected primary role node. For support system multiple role nodes, set the EquipmentSupportFunction.equipmentSupportFunctionRef attribute manually at creation to the EquipmentSupportFunction MO representing the secondary role, where the EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl attribute is set to false.
2. Set the ExternalNode.inciConnectorRef attribute to point to the shared MO that represents the unit acting as the intermediate unit.

## 2.7 Support Units

### 2.7.1 Add Support Unit

To add a support unit, no pre-configuration is needed. When the support unit is installed,

the system creates an MO representation automatically.

Steps

1. Install the support unit.
2. Connect the support unit to its host unit.
3. Check that the MMI of the support unit indicates that the support unit is operational.

If the support unit host has a support unit fault indicator, do the following:

4. Check that the MMI does not indicate any faults.
5. Check that a SupportUnit MO is created for the support unit.
    1. Check that the SupportUnit.productData attribute is updated.
    2. Check that the SupportUnit.providedServices attribute lists all the expected services. The following services are expected: BATTERY\_BACKUP EXTERNAL\_ALARM\_PORTS FAN GENERIC\_DEVICE POWER\_SUPPLY
6. Check that the MO for the host unit refers to the SupportUnit MO that is created for the support unit.

### 2.7.2 Remove Support Unit

Steps

1. Lock the support unit.
2. Remove the support unit.
3. Execute the SupportUnit.deregisterSupportUnit action. When all references to the SupportUnit MO are removed, the system removes the SupportUnit MO automatically.

### 2.7.3 Replace Support Unit

Steps

1. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute of the support unit host to LOCKED. Result: The support unit host is locked.
2. Check the SupportUnit.productData or the HwItem.productData attribute to see the name of the support unit.
3. Remove the support unit. For more information, see Replace Power or Replace Battery.
4. Execute the SupportUnit.deregisterSupportUnit action. When all references to the SupportUnit MO are removed, the system removes the SupportUnit MO automatically.
5. Install the new unit. For more information, see Replace Power or Replace Battery.
6. Unlock the support unit host by setting the corresponding FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.
7. Verify that the representation of the SupportUnit MO of the newly installed unit is created by the system.
8. Verify that the status of the SupportUnit.operationalState attribute is ENABLED.

If the unit is disabled, do the following:

9. Resolve all corresponding alarms on the SupportUnit MO.

### 2.7.4 Upgrade Firmware for Support Units

The firmware can be upgraded through CM CLI for support units that have the

capability of firmware upgrade.

The upgrade status and the error message are

indicated by the ExternalUp.cumulativeUpgradeStatus attribute and the

ExternalUp.unitUpgradeStatus attribute, respectively.

Limitations during Upgrade

The firmware upgrade has the following limitations and restrictions:

- The firmware upgrade attempts from other clients are rejected for the same support unit.
- Node restart is not allowed because it can terminate the ongoing upgrade. In this case, the value of the ExternalUp.cumulativeUpgradeStatus attribute is set to INIT\_FAILED by the system, and the value of the ExternalUp.upgradeTargetRef attribute is emptied.
- A support unit can be referenced from only one ExternalUp MO.
- Actions are allowed only if they do not compromise the upgrade. Different upgrade phases have different forbidden actions.

Executing the SupportUnit.deregisterSupportUnit action leads to

the re-creation of the SupportUnit MO for the support unit. After

the re-creation, the SupportUnit.restartUnit action is required

to reset internal state of the support unit. Upgrade procedure can be started

again.

Executing the SupportUnit.deregisterSupportUnit action and then

the SupportUnit.restartUnit action allows for the following use

cases:

- The upgrade is suspended because of dead lock or errors.
- The upgrade is not finished in the expected time.

Upgrade Procedure

Steps

1. Execute the ExternalUpManager.createExternalUp action to create external upgrade package for firmware. The following parameters must be set: uri The URI that points to directory that contains UP content password The password used to sign into the server that provides UP unitList The list of MOs for which external upgrade package is applicable Result: Firmware upgrade package is transferred from the external server to the local storage on the node. The ExternalUp MO is created.
2. Execute the ExternalUp.transferFile action to transfer the firmware package to the support units referenced in the ExternalUp.upgradeTargetRef attribute.
3. Execute the ExternalUp.activate action to install the firmware on the support units referenced in the ExternalUp.upgradeTargetRef attribute. Note: After executing the action, the operator must ensure that the following conditions are met: The No Connection alarm is not present on the SupportUnit MO. The unitStatus struct member of the ExternalUp.unitUpgradeStatus attribute is set to ACTIVATION\_COMPLETED. The value of the FwSlot.slotStatus attribute for the unit is set to LOADED. Result: Support unit restart is triggered to ensure that the unit runs on the latest firmware.

After This Task

To remove the unnecessary ExternalUp MO and files that are

temporarily stored in the node file system and associated with the upgrade packages,

the ExternalUpManager.removeExternalUp attribute can be used.

action is recommended to be executed.

#### 2.7.4.1 Upgrade Firmware Using ENM CM CLI Commands

The firmware for support units can be upgraded using ENM Configuration Management

(CM) CLI commands.

Prerequisites

- An ENM user has the Cmedit\_Administrator role to execute the CM CLI commands in the CLI application.
- The ENM user has the role required to download the firmware package. The role is based on the node type. For example, the ENodeB\_Application\_Administrator role for LTE node, and the GNodeB\_Application\_Administrator role for NR node.
- Another ENM user has only SupportUnit\_Operator role to download support unit software package onto the node or support unit.
- Support unit upgrade packages are imported to ENM.
- SMRS CM\_VIP is read from the global.properties file in the SMRS service virtual machine. In this file the corresponding attribute name is svc\_CM\_vip\_ipaddress.

Steps

1. Execute the following command to create an ExternalUp MO on the node under the ExternalUpManager MO and download the firmware package from ENM to the node file system: cmedit action &lt;ExternalUpManager\_MO\_FDN&gt; createExternalUp.(uri='sftp://&lt;SU\_Operator\_User\_Name&gt;@[&lt;SMRS\_CM\_VIP\_IP&gt;]:/software/&lt;SWP\_NAME&gt;/', password=&lt;SU\_Operator\_User\_Password&gt;, unitList=&lt;units\_MO\_FDNs\_List&gt;) The following parameters must be set: ExternalUpManager\_MO\_FDN The FDN of the ExternalUpManager MO. SU\_Operator\_User\_Name The ENM user with the SupportUnit\_Operator role. SMRS\_CM\_VIP\_IP The IP address that reads from the global.properties file. In this file the corresponding attribute name is svc\_CM\_vip\_ipaddress. SWP\_NAME The name of the software package obtained from the view software packages page in the Software Hardware Manager (SHM). If the software name contains spaces, the spaces must be replaced with underscores. SU\_Operator\_User\_Password The password of the ENM user with the SupportUnit\_Operator role. units\_MO\_FDNs\_List The list of MO FDNs for which the software package is applicable. Example cmedit action MeContext=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,ManagedElement=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,NodeSupport=1,ExternalUpManager=1 createExternalUp.(uri='sftp://su\_op@192.168.0.186/software/swName/', password=TestPassw0rd, unitList=["MeContext=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,ManagedElement=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,Equipment=1,SupportUnit=1","MeContext=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,ManagedElement=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,Equipment=1,SupportUnit=2"])
![Image](../images/158_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.A/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Wait until the value of the ExternalUp.cumulativeUpgradeStatus attribute is set to INIT\_COMPLETED. The value of the ExternalUp.cumulativeUpgradeStatus attribute can be read by the cmedit get &lt;ExternalUp\_MO\_FDN&gt;.cumulativeUpgradeStatus command.
4. Execute the following command to transfer the firmware file from the node to support units: cmedit action &lt;ExternalUp\_MO\_FDN&gt; transferFile Example cmedit action MeContext=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,ManagedElement=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,NodeSupport=1,ExternalUpManager=1,ExternalUp=1 transferFile
![Image](../images/158_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.A/additional_3_CP.png)
6. Wait until the value of the ExternalUp.cumulativeUpgradeStatus attribute is set to TRANSFER\_FILE\_COMPLETED.
7. Execute the following command to activate the firmware that is downloaded onto support units: cmedit action &lt;ExternalUp\_MO\_FDN&gt; activate Example cmedit action MeContext=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,ManagedElement=LTE83dg2ERBS00001,NodeSupport=1,ExternalUpManager=1,ExternalUp=1 activate
![Image](../images/158_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.A/additional_3_CP.png)
9. Wait for the value of the ExternalUp.cumulativeUpgradeStatus attribute set to ACTIVATION\_COMPLETED.

After This Task

To remove the unnecessary ExternalUp MO and files that are

temporarily stored in the node file system and associated with the upgrade packages,

the following command is recommended to execute:

cmedit action &lt;ExternalUpManager\_MO\_FDN&gt;

removeExternalUp.(externalUp='&lt;ExternalUp\_MO\_FDN&gt;')

# 3 External Alarms

External alarms are issued for external equipment connected to the node, or equipment within

the node that is defined as external equipment.

The following alarm trigger are possible:

- An external equipment supervision limit is exceeded.
- An external equipment fault condition exists.
- Alarm severity and actions to take depend on which external equipment is issuing the alarm. Information in the alarm is based on the configuration of the corresponding AlarmPort MO.

External alarm units, equipment, and sensors are connected to the node through Overvoltage

Protection (OVP) modules at the bottom rear of the cabinet. For instance, an alarm can be

introduced if the door to the room is open. An Open/Close-type contact is installed and a

twisted-pair cable is connected between the contact and the OVP. Up to eight alarms can be

connected to one OVP.

An external alarm is added by creating, configuring, and unlocking an

AlarmPort MO instance. This instance represents the used physical alarm

ports connected to the following units:

- SAU
- SCU
- Support system
- Support unit
- Internal radio

It is only possible to configure AlarmPort MOs in a primary node for an

SCU, SAU, support system, and baseband unit equipped with external alarm ports. For the

external alarms of support units, RRUS, and Radios, the AlarmPort MOs can

be configured in a primary or a secondary node.

With RDS Remote IRU Enclosure 2242, the external alarm is used to propagate the fan alarm

back to the Baseband unit. For more information on configuration, see the Radio Dot System

library.

Cabinet associated external alarms can be mirrored on a secondary role node. Alarms raised on

the Cabinet MO in the primary role node are mirrored on a

Cabinet MO instance with a corrensponding

Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute in the secondary role node.

Alarms raised on an AlarmPort MO instance are mirrored under the

VirtualAlarmPort MO. The VirtualAlarmPort MO is

auto-created and only exists when the alarm is raised on the primary role node.

Table 8   Mirrored Alarms

| Alarms                           | MO in Primary Role Node   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Enclosure Door Open              | Cabinet                   |
| Enclosure Smoke                  | Cabinet                   |
| Enclosure Smoke Detector Failure | Cabinet                   |
| External Alarm                   | AlarmPort                 |
| Disconnected                     | Cabinet                   |
| No Connection                    | Cabinet                   |

It is possible to configure the external alarm ports by configuring the attributes on

AlarmPort MO instances shown in Table 9. The attributes are intended to decrease the

number of alarm notifications sent for AlarmPort MO instances. It is

possible to filter out short events and low-frequency toggling alarms, where the time between

the alarms is higher than 60 seconds.

Table 9   Introduced Attributes

| MO Attribute              | Description          |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| AlarmPort.filterAlgorithm | See MOM description. |
| AlarmPort.filterTime      | See MOM description. |
| AlarmPort.filterDelay     | See MOM description. |

## 3.1 Configure External Alarm on RRU 22F1

Steps

1. Set the AlarmPort.alarmSlogan attribute to match the AlarmPort MO number as described in Table 10. Table 10 Alarm Slogans AlarmPort Setting Alarm Slogan 1 Valid battery not present (1) 2 AC power failed, battery is discharging 3 Low battery voltage 4 Battery connected or disconnected. Restart radio in 48 hours. (1) Recommended setting even if no backup battery is used.
2. Repeat the AlarmPort.alarmSlogan attribute configuration for each RRU 22F1 unit that is connected to the same Baseband unit.

## 3.2 Configure External Alarms on the Support System Primary Node

An external alarm is added by configuring and unlocking the AlarmPort MO

that represents the used physical alarm ports on the SAU, SCU, support system, or RRUS. The

attributes of the AlarmPort MO are created at the creation of the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO class on the SAU, SCU, support system, and

RRUS.

It is only possible to configure attributes under the AlarmPort MO in a

primary node for an SCU, SAU, and support system. For RRUS external alarms, the attributes

under the AlarmPort MO can be configured in a primary or a support system

secondary role node.

External alarms can be configured for any of the support systems.

Steps

1. Configure the AlarmPort.alarmSlogan attribute.
2. Configure the AlarmPort.perceivedSeverity attribute.
3. Configure the AlarmPort.normallyOpen attribute.
4. Activate the attributes under the AlarmPort MO by setting the value of the AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

## 3.3 Reconfigure External Alarms

Steps

1. Set the appropriate AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Set the appropriate attributes in the AlarmPort MO class to the required values.
3. Set the appropriate AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

## 3.4 Configure Mirroring of Alarms on the Support System Secondary Node

Prerequisites

- The AlarmPort MO on the primary role node is configured.

Steps

1. Set the value of the Cabinet.alarmInExternalMe attribute to TRUE in the support system secondary nodes on which the external alarms are activated.
2. Set the value of the AlarmPort.alarmInExternalMe attribute to TRUE in the primary nodes that have the same Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attributeattribute as the secondary nodes.
3. Set the value of the Cabinet.alarmInExternalMe attribute to TRUE in the primary nodes that have the same Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier as the secondary nodes.

## 3.5 Remove AlarmPort MO

Steps

1. Set the AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute of the desired AlarmPort MO to LOCKED.
2. Remove the AlarmPort MO.

# 4 Logs

## 4.1 Hardware Inventory History Log

The Hardware Inventory History Log allows the tracking of hardware replacements and

reconfigurations. Reconfigurations are only detected for hardware units with a serial

number.

Hardware reconfiguration occurs when a hardware unit is moved from its current position

to another occupied position.

If a RAN Compute unit is replaced, the log is restored on the new unit.

The log contains the following information of the replaced hardware unit:

- Additional text, which contains information if a replacement or reconfiguration is performed
- Name of the MO instance representing the hardware
- Hardware product name
- Hardware product number
- Hardware product revision
- Hardware product serial number

The log is stored at rcs/saf\_log/HWInvHistoryLog.

## 4.2 Environmental Log

The environmental log function allows for continuous monitoring of the cabinet condition

and cabinet state. The log also provides unit-specific data, even if the configuration

does not include climate control.

Table 11   Information in the Environmental Log

| Environmental Log Information                                                     | MO Class             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|

| DC                                 system                                 voltage | PowerDistribution    |
| Fan tray speed                                                                    | SupportUnit          |
| Fan tray temperature                                                              | SupportUnit          |

The environmental log has the following parts:

- Dynamic environmental log
- Environmental log header
- Static environmental log

A new log is created in the following cases:

- The role of a control instance changes from secondary to primary.
- The controlDomainRef attribute is changed to refer to a Cabinet MO instance.
- The unit represented by the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance has temperature measurement capability.
- The fan tray unit represented by the SupportUnit MO instance has fan speed and fan tray temperature measurement capability.

One environmental log data instance is created for each MO instance that has a primary

role. The controlDomainRef attribute must be set to the corresponding

Cabinet MO class. The following MO instances have a primary role:

- Climate
- PowerSupply
- PowerDistribution

The name of environmental log files refers to the corresponding MO in the form of

&lt;MO&gt;\_&lt;name&gt;\_Log\_&lt;number&gt;.xml. The

name field is filled with a unique name for each MO instance.

The &lt;number&gt; field is stepped for each new log file of the MO

instance.

For example, a log file is already created on the node for the

PowerSupply MO

instance,

and the second PowerSupply instance is created with the

EquipmentSupportFunction=1,

PowerSupply=secondPowerSupply LDN. In this case, the name of the

new file is PowerSupply\_secondPowerSupply\_Log\_2.xml. Once created,

the environmental log file is not removed from the node disc.

The name of

the

environmental log files refers to the corresponding MO in the form of

&lt;MO&gt;\_&lt;name&gt;\_Log.xml for

the following environmental log information:

- Fan speed
- Fan tray temperature
- Unit temperature level

The name field is filled with a unique MO name for each

instance of the MO class.

The environmental log is updated in the following cases:

- Every 24 hours, at midnight (00:00 node time)
- When the Main Load Disconnect alarm is raised on the BatteryBackup MO class
- If the unit temperature level reaches level 0, 8, or 9
- If the unit restarts, the log is updated once every 30 minutes.
- When the fan tray speed reaches 0% or 100%
- When the Loss of Mains alarm is raised on the SupportUnit MO class

Environmental logs on the primary node can be retrieved from the following sources:

- DCG command
- Node file system directly under rcs/persistent/support\_system
- Exported ESI to SFTP serverNote: All environmental log files are included. For more information, see the LogM.exportEsi action.
- Exported SAF log to SFTP serverNote: Each SAF log is exported for the corresponding Log MO. For more information, see the Log.export action.
- Exported with the Log.export MO action

Environmental Log Counters

Environmental log counters

allows

the observation

of

power-related data in RBS cabinets through monitoring system DC voltage, AC input

voltage interruptions, and power

load.

Power-related

data is collected from available power units located in an RBS cabinet and reported

by predefined PM counters. In a multicabinet configuration, the primary node also

reports power-related data from other cabinets.

The

PM counters are implemented as predefined.

The

PM counters start measuring when the PM

framework

is loaded. The

PM

counter data is recorded in the Recording Output Period (ROP)

files that are sent

to the

OSS

every 15 minutes.

The

PM counters are initialized with the value of 0,

and

the first measurement can be requested after the first full ROP is completed.

The PM

counter

data

is

only available on primary

nodes.

PM counters are reset after every

ROP,

except for the PowerSupply.pmPsuAcInputVoltageInterruption PM

counter. Data collected in the

PowerSupply.pmPsuAcInputVoltageInterruption

PM counter is also stored in a persistence file, from which it is

read after

a

restart. The

PowerSupply.pmPsuAcInputVoltageInterruption PM counter

measures the duration of AC power interruptions from the loss of AC power to the

return of AC power.

If the controlDomainRef attribute for the corresponding MO points

to the properly configured cabinet, all PM

counters,

except the following PM counters are

evaluated:

- FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevel
- SupportUnit.pmFanSpeed
- SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature

If the controlDomainRef attribute changes, all PM counters

are

marked

as

suspect

until

the end of the ROP, except

for

the

following

PM counters:

- FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevel
- SupportUnit.pmFanSpeed
- SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature

The values of the SupportUnit.pmFanSpeed and the

SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature PM counters are not

directly related to the values of the

FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevel PM counter. The

counters must be used to observe the values as stated in the

PM

counter description.

In a new ROP, PM counters behave

in

the following way:

- The evaluation of the PowerDistribution.pmSystemVoltage and PowerSupply.pmPsuPowerLoad PM counters resumes.
- The evaluation of the PowerSupply.pmPsuAcInputVoltageInterruption PM counter resets.

If the controlDomainRef attribute is removed, all counters are

marked as

suspect.

When a new controlDomainRef attribute is

configured,

PM counters behave

in

the following way in a new ROP:

- The evaluation of the PowerDistribution.pmSystemVoltage and PowerSupply.pmPsuPowerLoad PM counters resumes.
- The evaluation of the PowerSupply.pmPsuAcInputVoltageInterruption PM counter resets.

PM counters

are

marked as

suspect in the following cases:

- The value of the operationalState attribute of the related hardware MO is set to a value other than ENABLED.
- The value fo the availabilityStatus attribute of the related hardware MO is set to a value other than empty.
- The related hardware does not have energy measurement capabilities.

During every ROP,

the

APC

software

provides the cached measurement value when instant

PM counter

values

are requested by the pget or the show-counters

command. When the ROP is finished, the cached measurement values are used to update

PM

counter values in the ROP files.

PM Counters

PM

counters are implemented as predefined

in

the PmJob PREDEF\_Apc PM

job.

They start measuring when the PM Framework is loaded.

The following PM counters measure power-related data:

- PowerDistribution.pmSystemVoltage
- PowerSupply.pmPsuAcInputVoltageInterruption
- PowerSupply.pmPsuPowerLoad

# 5 RBS 6000 Support System

## 5.1 Power System for RBS 6000 Environment

The power system in the RBS 6000 rectifies, converts, and directly distributes the incoming

power supply to DC voltage for the RBS equipment. The power system also includes battery

support to supply DC voltage to the RBS equipment if the incoming power supply is low or

missing.

The support system primary role node controls and supervises the power support

system.

The variant of the power support system affects the supported level of functions in the

nodes. The supported functions can be grouped into the following groups:

| External Power Supply Supervision and Control   |    | It handles the external power that supplies power to the support system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Internal Power Supply Supervision and Control   |    | It handles the internal supply of power, which includes unit supervision, power supply             supervision, unit power and voltage measurement, load sharing, and output control.                                                                                                                  |
|                                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| DC Power Distribution Supervision and Control   |    | It handles the distribution of power internally, that is, unit supervision, power             distribution supervision, unit power and voltage measurement, and output control.                                                                                                                        |
|                                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Power configurations are described in Radio Node Configurations.

The controlDomainRef attribute on the

BatteryBackup, PowerSupply, and

PowerDistribution MOs refer to the cabinet where the power system

functions operate.

### 5.1.1 ECM Modules

ECM modules are used for internal and external power distribution. The ECM modules are

plugged into a PDU cassette or subrack. The modular hardware component is represented by

the PlugInModule MO.

A PlugInModule MO is automatically created by the system when an ECM

is detected by the PDU controller. The PlugInModule.plugInModuleId

attribute of the new MO is set to the lowest address used by the ECM.

Removing ECM

ECM can be removed by setting the value of the

PlugInModule.administrativeState attribute to

LOCKED, and deleting the corresponding MO. By locking the

PlugInModule MO, all alarms are suppressed.

If the ECM is removed without setting the value of the

PlugInModule.administrativeState attribute to

LOCKED, an alarm is raised on the

PlugInModule MO.

Replacing ECM

The following options are available for ECM replacement:

- If the type of the new ECM matches the type of the replaced ECM, the same e-fuse configuration is automatically applied to the new ECM.
- If the type of the new ECM differs from the type of the replaced ECM, the previous PlugInModule MO instance must be removed before removing the old ECM and adding the new ECM.

### 5.1.2 Configure Smart PSU Load Sharing

The Smart PSU Load Sharing algorithm keeps the PSU load at an optimal level. If the

average load on active PSUs drops below a configured value, one of the PSUs is set

to standby mode. In standby mode, the output voltage of the PSU is decreased by 2 V.

If the average load increases to a configured high value, the PSU in standby mode is

activated. The algorithm limits the PSU power losses at low load level, which

provides the optimal conditions for PSU operation.

The algorithm keeps the temperature of the PSUs at a balanced level by using a

rolling schema. If the temperature of the PSUs increases above the calculated

temperature threshold, an additional PSU is activated. The activation of an

additional PSU prevents fans from speeding up and consuming additional power.

Steps

1. Set the value of the lowLoadLevelThreshold struct member of the PowerSupply.SmartLoadSharingConfig attribute to the required value between 10 and 40. The default value is 30. The lowLoadLevelThreshold struct member of the PowerSupply.SmartLoadSharingConfig attribute defines the average load level in percentage, below which a PSU is set to standby mode.
2. Set the value of the highLoadLevelThreshold struct member of the PowerSupply.SmartLoadSharingConfig attribute to the required value between 55 and 85. Ensure that the following equation is fulfilled: highLoadLevelThreshold ≥ ( lowLoadLevelThreshold * 2 ) + 5 The default value is 70. The highLoadLevelThreshold struct member of the PowerSupply.SmartLoadSharingConfig attribute defines the average load level in percentage, above which a PSU in standby mode is set to active.

To activate the Smart PSU Load Sharing algorithm, do the following:

3. Set the value of the PowerSupply.smartLoadSharing attribute to true. Note: In case of one BFU, set the value of the PowerSupply.smartLoadSharing attribute to FALSE.

To deactivate the Smart PSU Load Sharing algorithm, do the following:

4. Set the value of the PowerSupply.smartLoadSharing attribute to FALSE.

### 5.1.3 Configure E-Fuse Hardware Component

The PDU hardware comes with preconfigured e-fuse parameter values. The current settings of

the parameter values for the individual e-fuses can be monitored through reading the

corresponding EFuse MO attribute.

The settings to use depend on the RBS configuration and the equipment to

which the e-fuses supply power.

Table 12   E-Fuse Actions and Parameters

| Action                       | Parameter                | Parameter Values       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| EFuse.setRemoteControllable  | EFuse.remoteControllable | true  false            |
| EFuse.setLoadType            | EFuse.loadType           | MAIN  PRIO             |
| EFuse.setColdStartup         | EFuse.onAtColdStartup    | true  false            |
| EFuse.setOutput              | EFuse.powerOutputState   | ON  OFF  TEMPORARY_OFF |
| No corresponding action  (1) | EFuse.userLabel          | string value           |

(1)

The EFuse.userLabel attribute is a customer-defined label.

Setting the value of this attribute takes effect immediately.

The settings depend on the RBS configuration and the equipment to which the e-fuses supply

power.

Steps

To adapt the e-fuse hardware component, the following actions must be executed:

1. Perform the EFuse.setRemoteControllable action. If the EFuse.remoteControllable attribute is enabled, the other three parameters can be remotely controlled.
2. Perform the EFuse.setLoadType action. The EFuse.loadType parameter is used to specify if the load of the e-fuse is a Main Load or Priority Load. The default value is MAIN but special outputs can be set to PRIO according to the given RBS and site configuration. Note: The remote control function must be enabled in the e-fuse to execute this action.
3. Use the EFuse.setColdStartup action. This action is used to set the EFuse.onAtColdStartup attribute. The EFuse.onAtColdStartup attribute is used to control if the e-fuse output is to be powered on at cold start or not. At node startup, outputs that have cold start enabled are powered up directly and outputs that do not have cold start enabled turn on when the cold start state returns to normal operation. Note: The remote control function must be enabled in the e-fuse to execute this action.
4. Use the EFuse.setOutput action. At node startup, the TEMPORARY\_OFF state changes to ON, while the ON and the OFF states remain unchanged. To prevent the permanent shut down of Baseband or Transmission equipment, a time-out sequence is implemented on the EFuse.setOutput action. In case of an unintentional shut down of the e-fuse that is connected to a primary Baseband or Transmission, the node restarts automatically in 30 seconds. To set the value of the EFuse.powerOutputState attribute to OFF or TEMPORARY\_OFF, the EFuse.setOutput action must be executed twice. The first EFuse.setOutput action must be executed with the value set to TEMPORARY\_OFF to start a time-out sequence and set the e-fuse to TEMPORARY\_OFF. The second action must be executed with the requested output state between 3 and 20 seconds after the first action. If not done within the time window, the EFuse.powerOutputState attribute is set back to the former state.

### 5.1.4 Battery

Batteries can be managed by different MO classes.

Lead-acid batteries and lithium-ion batteries provide backup power supply to the

site.

The different types of batteries are managed by the following MO classes:

- Lead-acid batteries are managed by the BatteryBackup MO.
- Intelligent lithium-ion batteries with management interface connected to the BPA are managed by the BatteryUnit MO.
- Lithium-ion batteries with a management interface connected to a radio unit are managed by the SupportUnit MO.

The disconnection threshold cannot be set for certain lithium-ion batteries. Such

batteries disconnect automatically during discharge if they reach low voltage.

The following lithium-ion batteries disconnect at 42 V:

- BKB 902 71/6
- BKB 902 71/11
- BKB 902 71/12
- BKB 902 71/21
- BKB 902 71/22
- BKB 902 71/221
- BKB 902 71/13
- BKB 902 71/131

The following lithium-ion batteries disconnect at 40 V:

- BKB 902 71/14
- BKB 902 71/18
- BKB 902 71/19

The BatteryBackup MO represents a whole battery cluster. The

SupportUnit MO represents a single battery unit or a battery

module. Alarms raised on the SupportUnit MO identify which battery is

suspected of being faulty.

For more information on the hardware aspect of batteries, see Manage Batteries.

#### 5.1.4.1 Battery Log

The battery log

function

allows for continuous monitoring of

the

battery condition and state.

The

results of battery tests are stored in the battery log, which contains the following

information:

- BatteryBackupMO attribute settings
- Battery temperature
- Battery test information and results
- Charging and discharging information
- ThermalRunawayTracking information

Part of the battery log data is represented

with

the following PM

Counters:

- BatteryBackup.pmBatteryDepthOfDischargeDistr
- BatteryBackup.pmBatteryDischargeTimeDistr
- BatteryBackup.pmBatteryMainLoadUnderVoltDiscTimeDistr
- BatteryBackup.pmBatteryTemperatureDistr

In

order to activate PM

counters,

the

PM

Scanner must be created and activated. For more information

on

related

PM

counters,

see the BatteryBackup MO. For more information on how to activate the

related PM

Counters,

see Manage Performance.

Battery log data is evaluated when the BatteryBackup.controlDomainRef

attribute is configured, or if the node is equipped with all of the following pieces of

hardware:

- At least one PSU
- A battery
- A BFU for lead-acid batteries or a BPA for lithium-ion batteries)

Once created, the battery log file is not

removed from the node disc.

The battery log is updated every 24 hours

counted from

restart,

or before the main load is disconnected.

Battery logs can be retrieved on the primary

node

using ESI.

When the node is restarted,

initial

values for

counters

are taken from the

battery log file.

Counter

values are evaluated

continuously, which

means

they

can differ from

the values stored in the battery

log.

#### 5.1.4.2 Battery Temperature Sensor

If a battery temperature sensor issue is detected, the Battery

Disconnected alarm is raised.

If the battery temperature sensor cannot be detected by the system, or if it is found to be

faulty, the Battery Disconnected alarm is raised. The control

system orders the BFU to disconnect the battery in the startup sequence and during BFU

supervision. The battery is disconnected in the charging direction, but it can be used for

discharge.

#### 5.1.4.3 Battery Thermal Runaway Prevention

The thermal runaway prevention function monitors the risk of thermal runaway and issues

an alarm if a risk is detected.

When batteries are charged, there is a risk for thermal runaway. The thermal runaway

prevention function continuously monitors the charging process. If a risk for thermal runaway

is detected, the Critical Temperature Battery Disconnected alarm

with the additional text Thermal runaway risk. is raised. When

the alarm is active, the batteries are disconnected from both charging and discharging for 24

hours.

The chargeMaxCurrent attribute configures the maximum

allowed battery current during charging. It is recommended to set the attribute value to

20-40% of the installed capacity, so for example 80 A is correct for batteries with 200

Ah up to 400 Ah.

#### 5.1.4.4 Shared Batteries

It is possible for several RBSs to share batteries.

When batteries are shared, the charging function must be configured in the same way in all

nodes that share batteries.

When multiple primary role nodes that control their support system share a

battery, the nodes are not communicating with each other. This means that each node must

be configured to execute battery related functions the same way as the other nodes that

use the same battery. A different configuration leads to an alarm.

The value of the BatteryBackup.sharedBattery attribute must be set to

TRUE in all nodes that share the battery. Only periodic and on-demand

battery backup time tests are performed simultaneously in nodes that share the same

battery.

The following battery functions are not activated when a battery is shared:

- Battery capacity test, bothperiodic and on demand
- Battery thermal runaway prevention
- Boost charging
- Equalize charging
- Intermittent charging
- Temperature-compensated float charging

#### 5.1.4.5 Battery Backup Examples

The examples include the following elements:

- BBSs or BBUs
- RBSs
- Circuit breakers
- Temperature sensors
- BFUs

Figure 8 shows a battery backup with one BBS or

BBU and two RBSs.

Figure 8   Battery Backup with One BBS or BBU and Two RBSs

Battery Backup in a Multicabinet Configuration

In a multicabinet configuration each cabinet can contain a battery backup. When a shared battery is used, the primary role node has full control of the battery as the primary role node controls all the hardware in a multicabinet configuration.

When multiple battery backup is used, one battery log file is assigned to each

BatteryBackup MO. The battery log file name refers to the corresponding

BatteryBackup MO in the form of Battery\_Log\_&lt;MO name&gt;.xml, so for

example Battery\_Log\_1.xml refers to the BatteryBackup MO=1.

#### 5.1.4.6 Battery Test

The

battery test function can be used for shared and non-shared battery

connections.

The battery test function allows continuous monitoring of the battery

condition.

It also enables a change of batteries when needed, instead of

periodically.

Battery Test Mode

The test mode value provides information about the schedule of the battery tests.

Battery tests can be set to automatic mode or to configured mode through the

BatteryBackup.testMode attribute.

False Alarms Caused by the Battery Test

The battery test function

might

cause false alarms. A failed test does not necessarily indicate a battery problem.

When the remote eNodeB battery test runs with extended battery

capacity on a site, the battery test can fail if the 120-hour limit is reached. The

battery test fails if the batteries are not discharged below the end voltage by the time

the 120-hour limit is reached.

Battery Test Scenarios

Battery tests can be initiated in different scenarios.

## 5.2 Climate System for RBS 6000 Environment

The climate system controls the cooling of the units inside the RBS 6000

cabinet.

The climate system controls the cooling of the units inside the RBS 6000 cabinet by

automatically adjusting the speed of the fans and the output signal to the heater. Any unit

that can send temperature information has the ability to affect the fan speed.

The following elements are the main parts of the climate control system:

- Internal fans
- Optional external fans with a heat exchanger
- SCUs
- Optional heaters

The internal fans maintain an airflow inside the cabinet, and the external

fans maintain the cooling of that airflow. The support system primary role node controls

and supervises the fan speed through the SCU.

For cold climates, it is possible to use a heater to keep the internal temperature above the

lowest operation temperature. An additional temperature sensor is connected to the SCU that

controls the heater.

The Climate.controlDomainRef attribute  refers to the cabinet where the

climate system functions operate.

For RBS 6131, some of these functions are gathered in a CLU. For more information, see  Climate Unit Description.

For RBS 6601 and RBS 6202, a separate power shelf can be installed outside the RBS to provide

an AC interface and battery backup. The climate system in the power shelf is not supervised.,

The SCU in the power shelf runs in autonomous mode and controls the fan speed based on its SCU

temperature.

RBS Cabinet Internal Zones

The interior of a cabinet can be divided into two zones by a mechanical plate in the return

air channel, restricting the airflow to the non-pressurized zone.

Table 15   RBS Cabinet Internal Zones

| Zone                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pressurized zone     | The pressurized zone is intended for units that require forced air cooling.  This zone ensures that proper forced airflow is achieved over the components of                     the unit.                                                                                                                                          |
| Non-pressurized zone | The non-pressurized zone is intended for units designed to have their own                     component cooling. In this zone, the ventilation is performed by the internal                     cabinet fans.  This zone is designed for non-specific 19-inch equipment, batteries, and                     naturally cooled units. |

The two-zone setup is created for the following purposes:

- Enabling less powerful fans
- Lowering noise profile
- Enabling using all types of equipment

### 5.2.1 Climate Control for Indoor Cabinets

The cooling of indoor cabinets is managed by the internal fans of the climate

system.

Internal fans, located on the top or back of the cabinet, draw ambient air through the

cabinet door. The air is drawn through the units and the warm air is evacuated by the

fans. The air restrictor plate separates the pressurized compartment from the

non-pressurized compartment. The non-pressurized space is used for optional equipment.

Units placed in the non-pressurized compartment have their own fans or are subjects for

natural convection cooling. As an example, transmission equipment can be placed in the

non-pressurized compartment..

### 5.2.2 Climate Control for Outdoor Cabinet

The cooling of outdoor cabinets is managed by the heat exchanger of the climate

system, or Direct Air Cooling (DAC).

Outdoor cabinets can be equipped with a heat exchanger (HEX) or a thermosiphon.

External fans create an airflow through the exterior part of the HEX, which creates a

lower temperature on the interior part of the HEX.

Internal fans create a cooling airflow inside the cabinet by forcing the internal air

through the interior part of the HEX. Then the internal fans expel it through the front

openings of the climate system, back into the cabinet.

.

Figure 9   Outdoor Cabinet with Heat Exchanger

Outdoor cabinets with DAC also exist. Internal fans, which are located at the top of the

cabinet, draw outdoor air through the equipment, from the front to the back. Therefore,

the cooling air temperature is limited by the outdoor ambient temperature.

Figure 10   Outdoor or Indoor Cabinet with DAC

### 5.2.3 Climate Modes

A number of climate control modes are available.

The speed and noise of external and internal fans depend on the value of the

Climate.climateControlMode attribute. The climate control mode is

activated by setting the Climate.climateControlMode attribute to the

required mode.

Table 16   Available Climate Control Modes

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Battery Protection

High temperatures around the battery can shorten the battery lifetime. If the cabinet

is equipped with external fans, they can be used to protect the battery by lowering

the cabinet temperature.

#### 5.2.3.1 Normal Climate Mode

Normal climate mode is the default mode used by the climate system.

The internal fans are controlled by the hotspot temperature from any unit installed in

the pressurized zone. External fan speed is set based on the internal fan speed.

The lowest speed the internal fans can have is the basic fan speed. The fan speed cannot

be set below this limit. The basic fan speed limit is static until the cabinet

temperature registered by the SCU reaches above 40°C. When the temperature reaches 40°C,

the basic fan speed limit is controlled by the SCU temperature, by using a linear

function.

Figure 11   Normal Climate Mode

#### 5.2.3.2 Battery Life Extension Climate Mode

Battery life extension climate mode improves the battery lifetime.

The internal fans are controlled by the hotspot temperature from any unit installed in

the pressurized zone. External fan speed is set based on both the internal fan speed and

the SCU temperature.

In battery life extension climate mode, the basic fan speed limit is automatically

increased when the internal cabinet temperature registered by the SCU reaches 40°C.

Figure 12   Battery Life Extension Climate Mode

#### 5.2.3.3 Boost Climate Mode

Boost climate mode allows for increasing the minimum cooling effect.

The internal fans are controlled by the hotspot temperature from any unit installed in

the pressurized zone. The external fan speed is set based on both the internal fan speed

and the SCU temperature.

The lowest speed the internal fans can have is the basic fan speed. The fan speed cannot

be set below this limit. The basic fan speed limit is static until the cabinet

temperature registered by the SCU reaches the limit set by the

Climate.boostInternalThreshold attribute. When the temperature

reaches the set threshold, the basic fan speed limit is controlled by the SCU

temperature by using a linear function. The attribute controls at what temperature the

basic fan speed needs to increase, and it does not impact the incline of the linear

function.

The customizable boost threshold makes it possible to increase the minimum cooling

effect. This can be necessary in cabinets where the majority of the equipment is in the

non-pressurized zone. It is recommended to adjust the boost threshold to a lower value

if any non-pressurized equipment inside the cabinet is reporting high temperature

alarms.

By default, the Climate.boostInternalThreshold attribute is set to

40°C for outdoor cabinets and 25°C for indoor cabinets.

Figure 13   Boost Climate Mode

#### 5.2.3.4 Eco Climate Mode

Eco climate

mode minimizes power consumption.

The fan speed control is optimized in eco climate mode to minimize the overall power

consumption by keeping the operating temperature within the optimal temperature range.

This mode is supported only for RBS 6601.

Figure 14   Eco Climate Mode

#### 5.2.3.5 Enhanced Climate Mode

Enhanced

climate mode provides enhanced cooling.

The enhanced climate mode allows controlling the internal and external fans based on

the

SCU temperature sensor. This mode also adjusts

to

hotspot data collected from the units that are installed in the

pressurized zone. The enhanced climate mode is configured with the

externalFanStartTemp and

internalFanRampUpTemp parameters of the

Climate.enhancedModeSetup

MO

attribute.

The internalFanRampUpTemp parameter defines the cabinet supply

temperature at which the internal fans starts to ramp up from their minimum fan speed.

This increases the air circulation and the transportation of heat from the units to the

cooling system inside the cabinet.

Figure 15   Graph of internalFanRampUpTemp Parameter Setting Example

The externalFanStartTemp parameter defines the cabinet supply

temperature at which the external fan starts. External fans control the

transport

of heat out of the cabinet.

Figure 16   Graph of externalFanStartTemp Parameter Setting Example

The values of the two parameters must be between

15 °C

and

40 °C.

The value

of

internalFanRampUpTemp cannot be lower than

the value

of

externalFanStartTemp.

The enhanced mode can cause increased acoustic noise. Because of this, it is recommended

to use this mode only when few or no units are installed in the pressurized zone.

Figure 17   Enhanced Climate Mode

The enhanced climate mode is available for the following RBS cabinets:

- RBS 6101
- RBS 6102
- RBS 6131
- RBS 6120
- RBS 6201
- RBS 6301

The enhanced climate mode is available for the following hardware units:

- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630

The Baseband 6620 or Baseband 6630 unit must act as the support system primary role

node for the enhanced climate mode to work.

### 5.2.4 Configure Climate System and Climate System Variants

The primary node in the cabinet controls the cabinet

climate.

Steps

1. Configure the Cabinet.climateRegulationSystem and the Cabinet.climateSystem attributes. Table 17 Configure climateRegulationSystem and climateSystem Attributes Product climateRegulationSystem climateSystem RBS 6110, RBS 6120 DAC Standard or Extended TS Extended RBS 6320 DAC Standard HEX Standard RBS 6102, RBS 6201 NOT\_APPLICABLE Standard or Extended All other RBS and Power cabinet NOT\_APPLICABLE Standard

If a specific climate operating mode is required, do the following:

2. Configure the Climate.climateControlMode attribute to specify the used climate control mode. Different modes are available depending on the equipment installed in the cabinet.
    - For DU nodes with integrated batteries in the RBS cabinet, set the attribute to BATTERY\_LIFE\_EXTENSION to improve battery lifetime.
    - For Baseband nodes, and nodes with a 19 inch equipment installed in a cabinet where additional air cooling is required, set the attribute to BOOST. If Boost mode has to be customized, the new attribute Climate.boostInternalThreshold is used. Its default value is empty which represents 40°C for outdoor and 25°C for indoor cabinet.

### 5.2.5 Climate Data PM Counters

#### 5.2.5.1 Climate Data PM Counters with Predefined Jobs

Counters with predefined jobs are collected in the PmJob=PREDEF\_Apc

and PmJob=PREDEF\_Nc MO instances. They start measuring when the node

boots.

Cabinet Temperature

The cabinet temperature is measured in °C by the SCU or by SUP 6601.

For indoor cabinets, the ambient air temperature is measured. For outdoor cabinets,

the cabinet temperature is measured, which is inlet air to cabinet products.

The Climate.pmCabinetTemperature PM counter measures the

temperature of the cabinet.

The Climate.cabinetTemperature attribute shows the current

temperature of the cabinet.

Unit Temperature

In configurations without SCU, the measurement of the cabinet temperature is not

available. Unit temperature level indicates the thermal state if the unit supports

temperature measurements.

The FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevel PM counter

measures the unit temperature in °C.

The FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevel PM counter is

available for the following units:

- 19-inch Baseband units
- All outdoor RAN Compute units
- Indoor RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4
- Indoor RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5
- Outdoor radio units

Fan Speed

The fan speed is measured in percentage of the maximum fan speed.

The following PM counters measure the fan speed:

| Climate.pmCabinetFanSpeed         |    | Internal cabinet fan speed   |
|-----------------------------------|----|------------------------------|
|                                   |    |                              |
| Climate.pmCabinetFanSpeedExternal |    | External cabinet fan speed   |
|                                   |    |                              |
| SupportUnit.pmFanSpeed            |    | Fan tray speed               |

In configurations without SCU, fan speed is measured by the fan tray. The

SupportUnit.pmFanSpeed PM counter is available for the

following units if they are equipped with a fan tray:

- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 3d
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5

Fan Tray Temperature

The SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature PM counter measures the

fan tray temperature in °C. The temperature is calculated as average inlet

temperature or average outlet temperature depending on the fan tray type.

If the fan tray does not support temperature measurements, the

SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature PM counter is empty or

marked as suspect, and the value of the

SupportUnit.fanTemperatureMeasurementType attribute is set to

NOT\_SUPPORTED.

Air Pressure

Air pressure is measured by SPM in Pa and kPa. It is only

supported by SCU 05 01, therefore only available for GSS.

The following PM counters measure air pressure:

| Climate.pmSpmBarometricAirPressure   |    | Barometric air pressure   |
|--------------------------------------|----|---------------------------|
|                                      |    |                           |
| Climate.pmSpmDifferentialAirPressure |    | Differential air pressure |

#### 5.2.5.2 Climate Data PM Counters without Predefined Jobs

The value of the

FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevelExtremeCold PM counter

is not collected as a predefined job.

Unit Temperature

Table 18   Unit Temperature Counters

### 5.2.6 Climate Observability

Climate data can be observed with predefined PM counters.

The following climate conditions can be observed in RBS cabinets with predefined PM

counters:

- Air pressure
- Fan tray speed
- Fan tray temperature
- Unit temperature level

Climate data is collected from available sensors located in an RBS cabinet where the

primary node is hosted predefined PM counters. Climate observability is available for

both cabinets and hardware units.

Air pressure is measured by SPM in Pa and kPa. It is only

supported by SCU 05 01, therefore only available for GSS.

The following PM counters measure air pressure:

| Climate.pmSpmBarometricAirPressure   |    | Barometric air pressure   |
|--------------------------------------|----|---------------------------|
|                                      |    |                           |
| Climate.pmSpmDifferentialAirPressure |    | Differential air pressure |

The fan tray speed is measured by the SupportUnit.pmFanSpeed PM

counter for the following units if they are equipped with a fan tray:

- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 3d
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4
- RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5

Fan tray temperature is measured by the

SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature PM counter.

If the fan tray does not support temperature measurements, the

SupportUnit.pmFanOperatingTemperature PM counter is empty or

marked as suspect, and the value of the

SupportUnit.fanTemperatureMeasurementType attribute is set to

NOT\_SUPPORTED.

Unit temperature level is measured by the

FieldReplaceableUnit.pmUnitTemperatureLevelPM counter for the

following units:

- 19-inch Baseband units
- All outdoor RAN Compute units
- Indoor RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4
- Indoor RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5
- Outdoor radio units

The data is used for analyzing climate status in RBS cabinets and hardware units over

time. The analyzation helps identify installation problems and prevents downtime caused

by inadequate climate conditions.

The PM counters are available on the secondary node, but they are not distributed from

the primary node.

The data is collected with the following process:

1. The counter data is recorded in the Recording Output Period (ROP) files that are sent to OSS every 15 minutes. The counters are implemented as predefined, which means that they start measuring when the PM Framework is loaded. The counters are initialized with the value of 0. The first measurement can be requested after the first ROP is completed, which means 15 minutes after startup.
2. During every ROP, the APC provides the cached measurement value when instant values of the counters are available through the following commands:
    - The pget command returns the current PM counter value.
    - The show-counters command displays the real-time value of the counters associated with a certain MO instance.
3. When the ROP is finished, the cached measurement values are used to update values of the counters in the ROP files.

Climate-related data is recorded in the environmental log. The log has a static and a

dynamic part that contain information about the following measurements:

- AC interruptions
- Cabinet temperature
- External cabinet fan speed
- Internal cabinet fan speed
- Fan tray speed
- Fan tray temperature
- Power load
- System voltage DC
- Unit temperature level

## 5.3 Multistandard and Multicabinet Configurations in the Support System

In multicabinet configurations, the primary node controls and supervises the support system

in all physical cabinets. Each cabinet can contain a battery backup. When a shared battery is

used, the primary node has full control of the battery as the primary node controls all the

hardware in a multicabinet configuration. For more information about the multicabinet

configuration, see Multicabinet Control.

In multicabinet configurations, it is possible to have the following nodes:

- Multiple primary nodes to make the configuration flexible. Each primary role node controls and supervises its separate support system in the cabinets. This enables the Baseband to be a secondary role node towards two or more different primary role nodes.
- Nodes with multiple roles. This makes the configuration more flexible so that it can handle large centralized RAN configurations.

Figure 18   Support System Control for Multicabinet

The choice of the support system primary node from the available nodes is decided by the

operator, but the following limitations apply in multistandard and multicabinet

configurations:

- In multicabinet configurations, the GSM DU node is not allowed to be the support system primary role node.
- In multistandard configurations, the GSM DU node is not recommended to be the support system primary role node. Furthermore, Baseband units of any standard must be used as the support system primary role node in RBS 6101, RBS 6102, and RBS 6201 in large mixed mode configurations, where the number of BFU, PSU and PDU units exceed the number of units supported by WCDMA DU and GSM DU configuration tools. For example when using two power sub-racks, it is possible to connect in total two BFUs, eight PSUs and eight PDUs. Hardware limitations must be checked for each node individually. For more information, see RBS Description.

Figure 19 shows an example where a Baseband unit

without an EC bus port functions as the primary role in a single cabinet configuration. The

primary node can be Baseband 6648 or Baseband 6631 and the secondary node can be Baseband 5212

or Baseband 5216.

Figure 19   Baseband Unit without EC Bus Port as Primary Role in Single Cabinet

Figure 20 shows an example where a Baseband unit

without an EC bus port functions as the secondary role in a single cabinet configuration. The

primary node can be Baseband 5212 or Baseband 5216 and the secondary node can be Baseband 6648

or Baseband 6631.

Figure 20   Baseband Unit without EC Bus Port as Secondary Role in Single Cabinet

### 5.3.1 Multicabinet Configurations

#### 5.3.1.1 Multicabinet Configuration with Shared Intermediate Units

MO instances of different support system role nodes are related to the physical equipment

in different ways in multicabinet configurations.

All three cabinets contain their own support system equipments. The two top cabinets also

contain Baseband units. The bottom cabinet does not contain any Baseband units, only a

shared intermediate unit.

Figure 21 shows the primary role view, Figure 22 shows the secondary role view, and Figure 23 shows the multiple role view in

multicabinet configuration.

The support system primary role node in the top right cabinet controls the following

systems:

- The support system in its own cabinet
- The support system in the bottom cabinet

The MOs of this node correspond to equipments in this cabinet and the bottom cabinet.

They do not correspond to equipments in the top left cabinet.

The support system multirole node in the top left cabinet controls the support system in

the top left cabinet. This node also has radio equipment in the bottom cabinet, which

needs to communicate with the node that is the support system primary node in this

cabinet. Therefore, this node is both a support system primary role node and a support

system secondary role node. It means it is a support system multi-role node. The MOs of

this node correspond to equipments in this cabinet and the bottom cabinet. They do not

correspond to equipments in the top right cabinet.

There are two more Baseband units in this setup, one in the top left cabinet, and one in

the top right cabinet. Both Baseband units are support system secondary role nodes. The

MOs of these two nodes correspond to the equipment in their own respective cabinets.

#### 5.3.1.2 Multicabinet Configuration with Multiple Primary Nodes

Multiple primary nodes can be used in a multicabinet configuration for better

flexibility. The primary nodes control the support system in the cabinet where they are

located.

In multicabinet configurations, WCDMA nodes can be primary nodes if they are connected to

the secondary node by an EC bus connection through a Baseband R unit.

LTE Digital Units and Baseband 5212 and Baseband 5216 units can function as secondary

nodes towards multiple primary nodes.

The support systems contain the following components for each cabinet:

- Climate hardware
- External alarm ports hardware
- Power hardware

View

Figure 26   Multicabinet Configuration with Multiple Primary Nodes, Secondary Role 2

View

Figure 27 shows that the Baseband unit without an

EC bus port can function as a secondary node towards multiple primary nodes.

For Figure 27, Figure 28, and Figure 29, the primary node can be Baseband 5212 or

Baseband 5216, and the secondary node can be one of the following units:

- Baseband 5212
- Baseband 5216
- Baseband 6631
- Baseband 6648

EC Bus Port), Secondary Role 2 View

#### 5.3.1.3 Multicabinet Configuration with One Primary Node

In standard configurations, there is one primary node, which controls the support system

for both cabinets.

The support systems contain the following components for each cabinet:

- Climate hardware
- External alarm ports hardware
- Power hardware

Figure 30 shows a multicabinet

configuration with one primary node from the perspective of the primary node.

Figure 32 shows that the Baseband unit without EC

bus port functions as a primary node.

### 5.3.2 C-RAN Configuration

In multicabinet configurations, nodes with multiple roles can handle large C-RAN

configurations.

If an RBS 6000 series cabinet is used for a C-RAN configuration without a Baseband unit

on the remote radio site, a Baseband R503 must be added to the system. This Baseband

R503 unit provides EC bus capability on the remote cabinet to control the cooling and

power system for radio units.

### 5.3.3 Integrate MINI-LINK 6691 into the Non-Pressurized Compartment

Equipment can be placed into the non-pressurized compartment of any enclosures that

are part of the RBS 6000 and TMR 6000 families.

Equipment without an EC connector cannot report its temperature to the support

system. Nevertheless, the climate control is adapted to the possible temperature

increase in the non-pressurized compartment of the enclosure.

Equipment with an EC connector reports its temperature to the support system through

the support system primary node. This information is used to control the climate in

the non-pressurized compartment of the enclosure by changing the fan speed.

All MINI-LINK products can be installed in the non-pressurized compartment of the

enclosure. However, only the MINI-LINK 6691 unit contains an EC connector and can

report temperature after it is connected to the support system primary node.

Prerequisites

- Ensure that the support system primary node is configured.
- Connect the MINI-LINK 6691 to the hub port on SHU.

Steps

1. In the Equipment MO, create an instance of the ExternalNode MO representing the MINI-LINK 6691. The ExternalNode.informationOnly attribute is automatically set to FALSE.
2. Create an EcPort MO as a child to this newly created ExternalNode MO.
3. On this newly created EcPort MO, set the hubPosition attribute for to the hub port that the MINI-LINK is connected to.
4. Check that the ExternalNode MO representing the MINI-LINK 6691 is populated with data received from the MINI-LINK 6691.

# 6 Configuration Examples

## 6.1 Configuration Flow

The configuration flow consists of creating the following files:

- A configuration template file that can be reused for multiple nodes
- A site-specific configuration file, which is created by populating the template file with site-specific parameters

Template files can be created in one of the following ways:

- Using the Configuration Generator for automatic template creation with the ECT or a plug-in in the Auto Provisioning application of the ENM.
- Creating new XML NETCONF files.

The preferred procedure is to use the Configuration Generator. Only edit the template file

with an XML editor if the required configuration is not supported by the tool.

When the preferred configuration procedure is used, it is not necessary to understand the MO

structure. However, for maintenance and troubleshooting, the MO structure must be

understood.

For more information on configuration methods, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool. For more information on

configuration files, see Manage Configuration Files.

## 6.2 Configuring Cabinet and Support System Units with the Basic Configuration Method

The ECT generates a NETCONF configuration file with the required MO elements based on GUI

input parameters. The ECT can also create multicabinet configurations with up to seven

cabinets. Primary or secondary roles of support system units are controlled by the

Support System Control parameter.

For more information about the ECT, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool.
