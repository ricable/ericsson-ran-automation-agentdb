# 1 Expansion Overview

Overview of expansion with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card.

There are several user guides available for the expansion, migration, and replacement of

Baseband Radio Nodes. To find the correct user guide for these use cases, see Baseband Expansion, Migration, and Replacement User Guides

Overview.

Summary

This document contains information on how to expand an existing Baseband Radio Node

with the following units:

- Radio Gateway R308
- Radio Gateway R608
- LC-05 9xCPRI line card in Conversion mode

The Baseband Radio Node can be expanded with up to two of these units in any

combination. The expansion with a Radio Gateway or an LC-05 9xCPRI line card in

Conversion mode enables increased capacity use of the Baseband unit by making more

RI-ports available.

For Baseband 6631, not all ports support eCPRI. For

more information, see Baseband Description for

Baseband 6631.

The CPRI link mapping for the radio units or Baseband R503 units that are connected

through the RI-ports on the Radio Gateway is specified during the expansion

procedure. All CPRI radios are moved from the Baseband unit to the Radio Gateway or

LC-05 9xCPRI line card. The Radio Gateway or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card is connected

with up to four eCPRI ports to the Baseband unit. Two eCPRI ports must be used for

connection if script is used for the expansion. Existing eCPRI radio units are not

moved during the Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card expansion.

All the sector and cell configuration for the node are kept after the expansion. For

an overall process of expansion, see Expand Baseband Radio Node.

## 1.3 Expansion Phases

Figure 1   Phases of Expansion with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI Line Card

# 2 Early Preparation

Early preparation of expansion with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card includes the

following:

- Upgrade the Baseband unit to a software level supporting the user radio configuration together with the Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card. For more information see, Radio Configurations for NR and Radio Configurations for LTE.
- Check if new or changed hardware configurations are needed. Note: Cabinet control functions handled through the Baseband R503 by EC-bus must be transferred to another unit, for example Controller 6610. The transfer is necessary if cabinet control functions are needed when a Baseband R503 is removed at expansion with Radio Gateway.
- Decide which expansion scenario to be used, see Figure 1.
- If cables cannot be connected directly between the Baseband unit and the Radio Gateway, LC-05 9xCPRI line card should be used together with Router 6673. For more information see, LC-05 9xCPRI Line Card Conversion Mode or the Ericsson R6000 library.

The RI-ports and links to be used for the Baseband unit to the Radio Gateway or LC-05

9xCPRI line card and for the radio units to the Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card,

are specified during the expansion in the CIQ file. For RI-ports naming, see Table 4.

Table 4   RI-Port Naming

| Radio Gateway                          | CPRI Ports   | eCPRI Ports   |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Radio Gateway R608  Radio Gateway R308 | A–H, J–M     | N, P–R        |
| LC-05 9xCPRI line card                 | 1–9          | 10–13         |

For more information about Radio Gateway Configurations, see Radio Gateway Configurations.

For more information on planning the cabling for Radio Gateway R608, see Radio Gateway Connections.

For a Baseband and Radio Gateway cabling example, see Figure 1 in Radio Gateway Connections.

For a Baseband and Radio Gateway setup example, see Figure 2 in Radio Gateway Connections.

# 3 Preparation

Preparation for the expansion with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line

card.

## 3.1 Run Pre-Health Check

When creating configuration for the expansion using the script, a health check must be

done to ensure that all Radios are connected to the Baseband unit and operational before

running the AMOS script.

When creating configuration for the expansion manually, it is recommended to run a health

check.

For instructions on how to set up and run a health check, see

Ericsson Network Manager CPI → ENM Operators Guide

.

The recommended category setting is EXPANSION. Errors detected

during the health check must be corrected before the expansion continues. For more

information on health check categories and rules, see Manage Node Health Check.

## 3.2 Prepare User Account

An ENM account must be prepared to perform the expansion. If the configuration is to

be created using the script, a node account must also be prepared.

Consider the security risks when handling the migration user account, as the

migration user requires access to the full node configuration and possibly to

several radio nodes. It is recommended to use Target Based Access Control (TBAC) as

an addition to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and remove the user when migration

is completed.

For more information, see the ENM Identity and Access Management System

Administrator Guide in the Ericsson Network Manager CPI

library.

Steps

1. Create an ENM account with the following ENM roles: Network\_Explorer\_Administrator Nedo\_Administrator Shm\_Administrator NodeSecurity\_Administrator NHC\_Administrator AutoProvisioning\_Administrator or AutoProvisioning\_Operator

If the configuration is to be created using the script, do the following

steps.

2. Add AMOS\_Operator to the ENM account.
3. Create a node account with the following COM roles for the Baseband unit: SystemReadOnly GNodeB\_Application\_Administrator used for NR node expansion ENodeB\_Application\_Administrator used for LTE node expansion

## 3.3 Create Configuration for Expansion Using Script

To trigger the reconfiguration of the node with the modified Radio Gateway or LC-05

9xCPRI line card configuration, an ENM AP expansion project must be created.

Supported Use Cases by the Expansion Script

- The Radio Gateway or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card is placed between the Baseband unit and the radio units.
- One or more Radio Gateway units or LC-05 9xCPRI line cards replace one or more Baseband R503 units.
- The Radio Gateway or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card is placed between the Baseband unit and the Baseband R503 unit. The Radio units remain connected to the Baseband R503 (to the same RI-ports) after the expansion.

### 3.3.1 Prepare Expansion Script

Prerequisites

The software level of the expansion script must correspond to the software level used

in the Baseband unit. The version of the expansion script to use is indicated in the

excel file containing the expansion script.

Steps

1. Fetch the expansion script ZIP file from the Expand Radio Gateway Script excel file.
2. Place the expansion script ZIP file in a directory which AMOS can access.
3. Extract the expansion script.

#### 3.3.1.1 Update Options for LC-05 9xCPRI Line Card Expansion

This procedure applies to

LC-05

9xCPRI line card expansion.

Steps

1. Open the RGW\_Expansion\_Options.xml file. Example Content of RGW\_Expansion\_Options file &lt;ExpansionOptions&gt; &lt;!-- The expansion options below must only be used with a ENM version 22.xx or later. Value 'true' means that expansion option is used --&gt; &lt;IsHealthCheckUsed&gt;false&lt;/IsHealthCheckUsed&gt; &lt;KeepR503&gt;false&lt;/KeepR503&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies whether R503s shall be kept at expansion with RGW/LC-05 or not. Is set to ´true´ an R503 is kept at expansion, otherwise it is replaced with the RGW/LC-05 --&gt; &lt;RGWinstance&gt; &lt;fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt;RGW-1&lt;/fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies the FRU id of the the new RGW/LC-05 FRU to be created. Id "RGW-1" is just an example --&gt; &lt;eCPRIlinks&gt;2&lt;/eCPRIlinks&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies the number of eCPRI links (1-4) between BB and this RGW/LC-05 FRU --&gt; &lt;/RGWinstance&gt; &lt;!-- Uncomment the following lines if more than one RGW/LC-05 instance is to be introduced at expansion --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;RGWinstance&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt;RGW-2&lt;/fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies the FRU id of the the new RGW FRU to be created --&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;eCPRIlinks&gt;2&lt;/eCPRIlinks&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies the number of eCPRI links 1-4 between BB and this RGW FRU --&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;/RGWinstance&gt; --&gt; &lt;/ExpansionOptions&gt;
![Image](../images/141_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AH/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Define how many Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card instances to be expanded with. If the node is just to be expanded with one Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card instance, keep the second instance commented in the options file as is already the case in the provided template file. If two Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card instances are to be created, removed the XML comment character in the beginning and end of each line for the second instance. See the following example from the options file: &lt;!-- Uncomment the following lines if more than one RGW/LC-05 instance is to be introduced at expansion --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;RGWinstance&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt;RGW-2&lt;/fieldReplaceableUnitId&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies the FRU id of the the new RGW FRU to be created --&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;eCPRIlinks&gt;2&lt;/eCPRIlinks&gt; &lt;!-- Specifies the number of eCPRI links 1-4 between BB and this RGW FRU --&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;/RGWinstance&gt; --&gt;
![Image](../images/141_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AH/additional_3_CP.png)
5. Define the Field Replaceable Unit identity or identities of the new Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card. In the template file, identities RGW-1 and RGW-2 are given as examples. The Field Replaceable Unit identity will be used when filling in the CIQ file.
6. Define how many eCPRI links to be used for each Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card instance. In the template file, two eCPRI links are specified as default to be used between Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card and Baseband unit. Up to four links can be specified.
7. Specify whether any Baseband R503s present in the expanded node will be kept. By setting the KeepR503 attribute in the options file to true, any present Baseband R503 units in the node will be kept at expansion. Otherwise, it is assumed that any R503s connected to the expanded node will be replaced by Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card units.
8. Save the file.

### 3.3.2 Create Expansion Profile

In this procedure, the downloaded expansion script is run towards the Baseband unit.

The changed configuration of the Baseband unit is copied and transformed into an ECT

ZIP file.

Contact your local support organization for how to handle any special configuration

data.

Steps

1. Execute the following command in AMOS towards the Baseband unit: Example /path/to is the directory where the expansion script files are stored &gt; run /path/to/RGW\_Expansion.mos /path/to/RGW\_Expansion.xsl Result: The output files from the expansion script are stored in a directory in: ericsson/log/amos/moshell\_logfiles/&lt;username&gt;/logs\_moshell/RGW\_Expansion/&lt;the name of the node&gt; The directory contains the following items: Template file directory Validation file directory BB\_restart.mos file
![Image](../images/141_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AH/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Create a ZIP file including the Template and the Validation file directories and the BB\_Restart.mos file. Example cd /path/to/RGW\_Expansion/&lt;the name of the node&gt; zip -r file.zip Template\ Files/ Validation\ Files/ BB\_restart.mos Note: It is important that the items are placed at the top level of the expansion project ZIP file.
![Image](../images/141_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AH/additional_3_CP.png)

11. Upload the filled in CIQ file in ECT and click Substitute.

Results

The CIQ parameters are substituted into the configuration files, the node

configuration is validated against selected MOM version and an ENM Auto Provisioning

expansion project is created.

## 3.4 Create Configuration for Expansion Manually

To trigger the reconfiguration of the node with the modified Radio Gateway or LC-05

9xCPRI line card configuration, an ENM AP expansion project must be created.

The main file inside the ENM AP expansion project is a NETCONF delta configuration file,

specifying the changes of the node configuration.

For more information about NETCONF and Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card

configurations, see:

- Format of a NETCONF file, see Ericsson NETCONF Interface.
- Supported Radio Gateway and LC-05 9xCPRI line card configurations, see Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband.

The manual method can be applied for any type of configuration supported by the Radio

Gateway or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card. For example files, see:

- Expand\_Add\_RGW\_before\_BB\_R503
- Expand\_Add\_RGW
- Expand\_Replace\_BB\_R503\_with\_RGW

## 6.2 Complementary Health Checks for Expansion

Complementary health checks are used to verify the health status of a node after a

completed expansion. Health checks can be performed in the following ways:

Node Health Check (NHC)

The NHC application enables the user to run node health status checks and generate

reports of such checks using ENM.

For more information, see ENM Online Help in ELEX.

Automated Health Check (AHC)

AHC provides health checks and diagnostics after a finished expansion project using

ENM Flow Automation. In addition, AHC can be used to verify the health status of up

to 20 nodes before an expansion project.

For more information, see Manage Automated Health Check.

Node Health Validator (NHV)

NHV in EMGUI provides node health status and health validation for troubleshooting,

or after hardware installation and replacement, using LMT port or ENM.

For more information, see EMGUI Node Health Validator.
