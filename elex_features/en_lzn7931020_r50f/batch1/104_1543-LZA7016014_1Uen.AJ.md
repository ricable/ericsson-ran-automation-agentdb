# 2 Remedy Action for RetSubUnit: Error on RET-specific Procedure sequence, with reason ANTP\_ANU\_ERROR\_INVALID\_FILE\_CONTENT.

The RET Failure alarm with this additional text is raised when the file that is

needed for the actuator to know how to move that specific antenna unit is

missing.

The following steps can be done remotely:

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Install a correct antenna configuration file, see Manage Hardware Equipment for more information. Note: When the MALD is configured, the installation requires the ALLOWED MALD security setting.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for RetSubUnit: Error on RET-specific Procedure sequence, with reason ANTP\_ANU\_ERROR\_MOTOR\_JAM.

The RET Failure alarm with this additional text is raised when there is a physical

problem with the motor or the actuator detected on the RET subunit tilting the

addressed antenna

unit.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Execute the RetSubUnit.clearActiveAlarms action.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Send a technician to site.
4. Inspect the antenna and remove any physical obstructions for tilt.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Identify and change the equipment that is suspected of being faulty according to appropriate document in RBS Site Products library.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for RetSubUnit: Shortage of: ConfigurableVerticalBeamWidthMode (CXC4012285).

The alarm is raised with UnsupportedProcedure error code

when verticalBeamWidthMode is set to WIDE value

when there is no active license or capability is exceeded for the WIDE mode of

Configurable Vertical Beam Width.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Activate license for Configurable Vertical Beam Width feature or switch back the verticalBeamWidthMode to NARROW. Note: For more information on the steps of license activation, see Hardware-Related Capabilities . When MALD is configured, changing attribute values requires the READ\_WRITE authority access.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Action for RetSubUnit: Error on RET-specific Procedure sequence, with reason ANTP\_ANU\_ERROR\_ACTUATOR\_INTERFERENCE.

The RET Failure alarm with this additional text is raised when the actuator is moved

by an unknown reason.

The following steps can be done remotely:

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Set a new value for electricalAntennaTilt attribute to tilt the antenna to the wanted position. Note: When MALD is configured, changing attribute values requires the READ\_WRITE MALD authority access.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 6 Remedy Action for RetSubUnit: Error on RET-specific Procedure sequence, with reason RET General Error: &lt;Text received from GetDiagnosticInfo&gt;.

The RET Failure alarm with this additional text is raised when the Antenna Line

Device (ALD) reports general error for the specific RET subunit.

The following steps can be done remotely:

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Reset the ALD.
3. Install a correct ALD configuration file, see Manage Hardware Equipment for more information. Note: When the MALD is configured, the installation requires the ALLOWED MALD security setting.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 7 Remedy Action for RetSubUnit: Error on RET-specific Procedure sequence, with reason ALD Internal Error[: &lt;Text received from GetDiagnosticInfo&gt;].

The RET Failure alarm with this additional text is raised when the Antenna Line

Device (ALD) reports internal error for the specific RET subunit.

The following steps can be done remotely:

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Reset the ALD.
3. Install a correct ALD configuration file, see Manage Hardware Equipment for more information. Note: When the MALD is configured, the installation requires the ALLOWED MALD security setting.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
