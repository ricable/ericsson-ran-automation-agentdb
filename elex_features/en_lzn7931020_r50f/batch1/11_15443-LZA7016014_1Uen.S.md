# 1 Integration Planning

Integration of a Baseband Radio Node can be completed in multiple ways. It is

important to plan ahead and decide on the integration method to use.

Integration Methods

A Baseband Radio Node can be integrated using the Zero Touch or Local Machine

Terminal (LMT) integration methods. Both methods offer a certain degree of

automation but Zero Touch requires less on-site action. LMT integration requires a

client device to be physically connected to the node during the integration

process.

Network Infrastructure Requirements

Both integration methods require certain network elements and services. Zero Touch

requires DHCP servers to be provisioned before the method can be used. If IPsec is

used for Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), Zero Touch also requires

an additional configuration of the Security Gateway.

Infrastructure requirements are detailed further in the document.

Monitoring and Supervision

Both Zero Touch and LMT integration can be monitored on-site. The basic monitoring

method for Zero Touch is to look at the status of the optical indicators, without

the need to connect any device to the node. However, both integration methods can

also be monitored using a client with a web browser through the Autointegration Web

GUI, using a mobile device with the Ericsson Site Assistant application, or using

ENM Auto Provisioning.

Hardware Binding

Hardware binding means mapping the node to node site, by binding the logical node

representation in the OSS with the hardware serial number or node logical name. In

Zero Touch Integration, node hardware must be bound as a part of the integration

process. Binding is done using either the node serial number or the node logical

name. Depending on whether the information on the exact node to be integrated is

known in advance, the following binding scenarios apply:

- Zero Touch integration early binding: node serial number must be known early and has to be included in the configuration files.
- Zero Touch integration late binding: node serial number or logical name can be provided at the start of the execution phase.

Choice of the Integration Method

Considering all of the above, the choice of the integration method can be based on

the following factors:

- Extent of the on-site actions Zero Touch integration requires less on-site supervision. The node can be powered on and the integration can be monitored with just the optical indicators. On the other hand, LMT integration requires manual triggering with a client device connected to the node.
- Available network infrastructure The choice of the integration method can also also influenced by the availability of network infrastructure. Zero Touch integration requires a DHCP server or a relay agent in the transport infrastructure as a prerequisite. ENM offers a DHCP solution, which can be provisioned automatically.
- Node hardware information If the node serial number is known in advance, Zero Touch with early binding can be used. If the hardware data is not available during preparation that is during the creation of the configuration files, Zero Touch with late binding is the available option.

# 2 Integration Infrastructure Overview

Baseband Radio Node requires a network infrastructure to be provisioned.

The infrastructure consists of the Transport Network, an instance of the Ericsson Network

Manager (ENM), and associated services.

Figure 1   Infrastructure Overview

DHCP Server

Zero Touch integration requires a DHCP server to be provisioned in the network

infrastructure. The following deployments are possible:

| DHCP server in ENM                   |    | All the DHCP parameters are provisioned automatically and the only                             additional requirement in the transport network is that a DHCP relay                             function is located in the router adjacent to the node.   |
|--------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                      |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| DHCP server in the Transport Network |    | The DHCP server needs to be provisioned with a number of options required                             by the node. The required parameters are explained in detail in DHCP Server.                                                                        |

IPSec Requirements

If IPsec is used in the node, PKI infrastructure that is the CA/RA service is

required. The service may be provided either by the ENM PKI infrastructure, in which

case the provisioning of the service is automatic, or by an external PKI. For more

information on the configuration of an external PKI infrastrucutre see Configure PKI Infrastructure.

# 3 ENM Infrastructure Provisioning

ENM infrastructure must be set up before node integration.

For information on how to set up the ENM infrastructure, contact the Ericsson Customer

Unit.

# 4 Transport Network Infrastructure Provisioning

Provisioning of the transport network covers a wide spectrum of activities. The actions

described in this document are limited to the infrastructure, which supports Zero Touch

integration.

## 4.1 Router Configuration

### 4.1.1 DHCP Relay

If DHCP is used and the DHCP server is not located in the router adjacent to the node, a

DHCP relay is needed. This applies especially to the case, when the DHCP server in ENM

is used.

If ENM is used, the DHCP relay function is configured as follows:

1. Relay agents in the router are configured, to forward DHCP requests to the primary DHCP server in ENM.
2. The primary DHCP server can be found by logging in to the itservices VMs and checking the status of the dhcpd/dhcpd6 service to see if it is running.

### 4.1.2 IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol Configuration

When IPv6 is enabled, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is used between the router

and the node to communicate network properties to the node. This information is used by

the Zero Touch feature in the node to choose between IPv6 stateless or stateful address

allocation. The router must be configured to return the correct settings, especially the

correct value of the M and O flag in the Router Advertisement message (RA). The flags

can be described as follows:

| M flag   |    | If the M flag is set, the node assumes that the IP address is allocated using                         a DHCP server. If the flag is not set, the node uses the IPv6 stateless                         allocation. This applies only to the temporary IP addresses, which are                         allocated as a part of Zero Touch integration. The same mechanism can also                         be used for permanent transport configuration of the node, but this option                         is defined separately.   |

|          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| O flag   |    | The flag indicates if additional data is available through DHCP. It must be                         set to 1 for Zero Touch integration. If the M flag is set, the O flag has no                         effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## 4.2 DHCP Server

A DHCP server can be used in the node for the following purposes:

- To provide temporary transport data during Zero Touch integration.
- To allocate transport data, including IP addresses and the default route in the node during normal operation.

Information contained in this chapter applies only to cases, in which the embedded DHCP

server in ENM is not used. The DHCP server in ENM is provisioned automatically and in

this case, you may skip this chapter.

Additionally, for details on transport data allocation during normal operation, see Manage Transport Network.

### 4.2.1 Basic Requirements of DHCP Server for Zero Touch Integration

This section describes the requirements of a DHCP server supporting Zero Touch

integration when IPsec is not used.

In addition to the options described in the following tables, an IPv4 DHCP server must be

provisioned to assign an IP address to the node, as defined in the Dynamic Host

Configuration Protocol RFC 2131.

For IPv6, either stateful or stateless allocation of IP addresses can be used, see Router Configuration. If stateful allocation is selected, the IPv6 DHCP

server must be provisioned to allocate an IP address as defined in the Dynamic Host

| Client ID          |              61 | During Zero Touch integration, the node sets the client identifier to                                 the serial number of the Baseband unit used. As an alternative, the                                 person integrating the node at site can set the name of the node                                 through a device and in such a case the node uses the node name as                                 DHCP client identifier instead.  RFC 2132                                                                                                                                                 |
| Subnet Mask        |               1 | O&M subnet mask of the node.

| Domain Server      |               6 | IP address to the DNS server.  The DNS server option needs to be provisioned if the IP address of                                 the AIWS is not provided in the DHCP server (see WWW Server                                     description for details).

### 4.2.2 DHCP Requirements when IPsec Is Used

When IPsec is used, Zero Touch integration requires that a DHCP server is located in the

untrusted/outer network. The node also requests some parameters via the security

gateway. See Security Gateway Configuration for details.

In addition to the options defined in the following tables, an IPv4 DHCP server must be

provisioned to assign an IP address to the node (as defined in RFC 2131).

For IPv6, either stateful or stateless allocation of IP addresses can be used, see Router Configuration. If stateful is selected, the IPv6 DHCP server must be

provisioned to allocate an IP address as defined in RFC 8415.

### 4.2.3 DHCP Requirements When External PKI System Is Used

If standalone PKI/CA system is configured in operators network then DHCP server needs to

be configured with Enrollment data parameters, for Zero Touch integration or Zero Touch

replacement cases.

Enrollment data specification in Site Installation File (SIF) is applied for LMT

Integration or LMT replacement cases.

The tables specify DHCP options used to request and provide Enrollment data, for IPv4 and

IPv6 transmission network.

## 4.3 DNS Setup

In the node configuration, the user can specify a number of external addresses as domain

names rather than the actual IP addresses. It requires that a DNS server is available

and responds on a query for that domain name. However, a few domain names are not

described or configurable in the Managed Object Model of the node to be provisioned in

the DNS servers under certain circumstances, presented in the table.

| Service   | Used Domain Name                                                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The DNS performing this resolution                                 must be located in the same network as the actual CA/CRL DP.

## 4.4 Security Gateway Configuration

If IPsec is used, a Security Gateway (SEG) is required in the network. For information on

IPsec and requirements for node integration, see Manage IPsec and SEG-specific documentation. Ensure that the

following is considered when configuring the SEG:

- If OAM is protected by IPsec and if Zero Touch integration is used, the SEG must be configured to support dynamic allocation of inner IP addresses using IKEv2 configuration payload. During the Zero Touch integration, a temporary IPsec VPN connection is established and this connection requires the SEG to support IKEv2 Configuration Payload. It is possible to use a different SEG for the temporary IPsec VPN connection during Zero Touch versus the permanent IPsec VPN connection that will be used during normal node operation. In such a case, the SEG used for normal node operation does not have to support IKEv2 Configuration Payload.
- When IKEv2 Configuration Payload is used to allocate the inner addresses of the node, the SEG can be configured in various ways, either using an assigned pool of addresses configured in the SEG or using the addresses from an external server, retrieved by SEG using, for example DHCP or RADIUS. The choice is specific to SEG implementation, refer to the information from the SEG vendor.
- To support Zero Touch integration, SEG must also be configured to provide the address of the inner DNS server, to resolve the IP address of the AIWS server.

## 4.5 Configure PKI Infrastructure

The PKI infrastructure/CA server needs to be setup and configured. For guidance on the

setup and requirements on the infrastructure, contact the Ericsson Customer Unit.

## 4.6 Time of Day NTP Servers

The node requires NTP servers to correctly set and adjust the time of day used in the

node. The NTP servers provided by ENM are normally used for this purpose, see ENM Infrastructure Provisioning.

However, if ENM is not used, the NTP servers used must be properly dimensioned to handle

the load from the nodes.

### 4.6.1 Time of Day NTP Servers and Stratum 0

The Baseband NTP client accepts an NTP server reply containing stratum 0. This behavior,

even though it is not aligned with the NTP standard, is supported due to legacy

reasons.

To ensure proper NTP functionality in the network, no NTP server should be configured to

reply with stratum 0.

### 4.6.2 Manage the Time of Day NTP Servers

It is recommended to set NtpServer MO to the administrative state

LOCKED during the NTP server maintenance window to prevent

irregular data from being sent by the NTP server.
