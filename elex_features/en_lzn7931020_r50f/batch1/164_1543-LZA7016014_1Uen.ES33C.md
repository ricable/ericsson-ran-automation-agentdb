# 2 Remedy Action for Climate: Parameter climateControlMode value ENHANCED is not supported by the equipment represented by the MO listed in Additional Information.

This alarm is raised when the operator has made a mistake in the MO or Equipment (HW)

configuration. The system has failed to setup some resources due to a mismatch

between MO configuration and capabilities of the installed Equipment (HW), covering

also the case where the capacity of the installed equipment is exceeded by the MO

configuration.

The alarm is raised if the Climate.climateControlMode attribute is

set to ENHANCED, but the cabinet type is empty or not valid.

# 82 Remedy Action for PowerReservation: Alarming MO not supported by equipment represented by MO in Additional Information.

This alarm is for future use and not yet fully implemented.

# 83 Remedy Action for Power Reservation: Individual or combined value of parameter reservedOutputPower in one or more elements in parameter outputPowerReservationPerBand inconsistent with capability of equipment represented by MO in Additional Information.

This alarm is for future use and not yet fully implemented.

# 84 Remedy Action for PowerReservation: Frequency band specified by value of parameters minDlFrequency, maxDlFrequency in one or more elements in parameter outputPowerReservationPerBand inconsistent with capability of equipment represented by MO in Additional Information.

This alarm is for future use and not yet fully implemented.

# 85 Remedy Action for NetworkIdentity: Value of parameter neighborPortId inconsistent with neighbor port ID values fetched from physical connections towards the unit represented by parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO. Neighbor port ID values are listed in Additional Information.

This alarm is raised when

the

operator has made a mistake in the MO or Equipment (HW)

configuration. The system

has

failed to setup some resources due to a mismatch between MO

configuration

and

capabilities of the installed Equipment (HW),

covering

also the case where the capacity of the installed equipment is exceeded by the MO

configuration.

The alarm is raised if a cable in the unit, which

is

represented by a parent FieldReplaceableUnit

MO, might be connected to a different router port than the router port specified by the

NetworkIdentity MO that raised the alarm. This

might be caused by the following issues:

- The network identity that is fetched on the physical connections towards the FRU, which is represented by the by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO is configured under a NetworkIdentity MO that belongs to a different FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
- The NetworkIdentity MO that raised the alarm is configured with a network identity that is fetched on the physical connection towards an FRU represented by a FieldReplaceableUnit MO that is not the parent of the NetworkIdentity MO that raised the alarm.

The

cables

of other units might also be connected to incorrect router ports. It is recommended

to perform remedy actions for the alarm together with the same alarms raised on

other NetworkIdentity MOs.

Additional Information is provided to help locate

the

cable that is not connected properly. The Additional Information

contains the configuration of the

NetworkIdentity

MO that raised the alarm and the network identity that is

fetched

on the physical connection towards the unit represented by the parent

FieldReplaceableUnit MO.

When the alarm is raised, the system tries to

keep the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO

enabled to maintain alarm information.

For detailed instructions on how to configure a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent on

router ports, see DHCP in the Ericsson R6000

library. Interface-ID values must be unique among router ports. For more

information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute in the Additional Information is correct. Note: If the value of the Configured.NeighborPortId element in the Additional Information is incorrect, go to Step 3. If the Configured.NeighborPortId element in the Additional Information is correct, go to Step 6.
3. Lock the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
4. Configure the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute of the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that raised the alarm.
5. Unlock the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
6. Send a technician to site.
7. Verify that the cables in the unit, which is represented by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO, are connected to the correct router ports with Interface-ID values equal to the Configured.NeighborPortId element in the Additional Information. If a cable is connected to an incorrect port, connect it to the correct port. Note: The value of Connected.NeighborPortId element in the Additional Information can be used to determine the router ports the unit is connected to, represented by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
8. Perform the FieldReplaceableUnit.restartUnit action with the restartRank parameter set to RESTART\_WARM.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
