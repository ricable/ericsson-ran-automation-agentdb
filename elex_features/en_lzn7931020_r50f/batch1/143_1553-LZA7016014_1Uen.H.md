# 1 MACsec Overview

MACsec protects unencrypted user data running directly on the Ethernet protocol level by

providing the following security services:

- Authentication
- Integrity protection
- Confidentiality
- Replay protection

# 2 Manage MACsec

## 2.1 Prerequisites

No prerequisites are required for the MACsec feature.

## 2.2 Feature Limitations

### 2.2.1 Radio Gateway Units, CPRI RI Links, Non-RI Ports, and Point-To-Point Logical Connections

The following configurations are not supported by MACsec:

- The MacSecProfile MO refers to an RI link that is connected with Radio Gateway unit.
- The MacSecProfile MO refers to an RI link with a CPRI transmission standard.
- The MacSecProfile MO refers to an RI link that is connected to a non-RI port type.
- The MacSecProfile MO refers to an RI link that is connected to RiNetwork MO.
- The MacSecProfile MO refers to an RI link when a point-to-point logical connection is tunneled through an arbitrary switched network. The network is configured by setting the value of the RiLink.transportType attribute to ETHERNET\_OVER\_E\_LINE.

When the configuration is not supported by MACsec, the system created MOs that are

related to the MacSecProfile MO are not created and the link is not

secured.

### 2.2.2 MACsec Configuration Constraints

MACsec hardware acceleration block in some RAN Compute units places the limitation on the

configuration of certain RI ports. The ports of the same group must have the same

MacSecProfile MO settings. See Table 1 for more details.

The configuration can be verified by checking the MacSecCp MO.

Table 1   MACsec Limitation on Port Groups

| Product Name         | Port Groups                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Baseband 6641        | Group 1: RiPort=A, RiPort=B     Group 2: RiPort=C, RiPort=D     Group 3: RiPort=E, RiPort=F     Group 4: RiPort=G, RiPort=H     Group 5: RiPort=J                                           |
| Baseband 6648        | Group 1: RiPort=A, RiPort=B     Group 2: RiPort=C, RiPort=D     Group 3: RiPort=E, RiPort=F     Group 4: RiPort=G, RiPort=H     Group 5: RiPort=J, RiPort=K     Group 6: RiPort=L, RiPort=M |
| Radio Processor 6337 | Group 1: RiPort=A, RiPort=B     Group 2: RiPort=C, RiPort=D     Group 3: RiPort=E, RiPort=F     Group 4: RiPort=G, RiPort=H                                                                 |
| Radio Processor 6347 | Group 1: RiPort=A, RiPort=B     Group 2: RiPort=C, RiPort=D     Group 3: RiPort=E, RiPort=F     Group 4: RiPort=G, RiPort=H     Group 5: RiPort=J                                           |

In the following example, MacSecCp=BB6648\_RiPort\_A and

MacSecCp=BB6648\_RiPort\_B refer to the RI port under the same

group but referred by different MacSecProfile MO.

Example 1   Incorrect MACsec Configuration

MacSecCp=BB6648\_RiPort\_A and

MacSecCp=BB6648\_RiPort\_B refer to the RI port under the same

group but referred by different MacSecProfile MO.

Table 2   Incorrect Reference Configuration

| MO                       | Attribute           | Value                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| MacSecCp=BB6648_RiPort_A | MacSecCp.portRef    | FieldReplaceableUnit=BB6648, RiPort=A |
| MacSecCp=BB6648_RiPort_A | MacSecCp.profileRef | Transport=1, MacSecProfile=1          |
| MacSecCp=BB6648_RiPort_B | MacSecCp.portRef    | FieldReplaceableUnit=BB6648, RiPort=B |
| MacSecCp=BB6648_RiPort_B | MacSecCp.profileRef | Transport=1, MacSecProfile=2          |

### 2.2.3 Incorrectly Connected Cable Detection When MACsec Is Configured

MACsec configuration is based on the correct alignment between the RI link configuration

and the physical cable connections. If the configuration is incorrect, the traffic might

be blocked on the incorrectly connected link.

Example 2   Incorrectly RIPort Configuration

Table 3   Example RiPort Configuration

| Attribute         | Configuration                              | Physical Connection          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| RiLink.riPortRef1 | FieldReplaceableUnit=BB6648, RiPort=A      | RiPort=A in the BB6648       |
| RiLink.riPortRef2 | FieldReplaceableUnit=AIR3239,RiPort=DATA_1 | RiPort=DATA_2 in the AIR3239 |

## 2.3 Configure MACsec

The MACsec feature is configured through the MacSecProfile MO and the

system created MOs that are related to the MacSecProfile MO. See the

detailed MO structure in Figure 1.

The read and write access to MACsec MOM configuration is restricted to Transport

Application Security Administrator role.

For more information on affected and new MOs, see MACsec.

Figure 1   MACsec Managed Object Model

MACsec can be configured for all individual RI links or only for a certain set of RI

links.

After the creation of the MacSecProfile MO, the following MOs are

automatically created for all referenced RiLink MOs:

- Two instances of MacSecCp MO, one for each RiPort MO.
- Two instances of MacSecUcp MO, one for each RiPort MO.
- One instance of MacSecCa MO

The MacSecCp MO and MacSecUcp MO are constructed by

parsing the MacSecCp.portRef and MacSecUcp.portRef

attributes to indicate which port they refer to.

### 2.3.1 Configuring MacSecProfile MO with Default Values

The default MacSecProfile MO is applied to all

RiLink MOs. See Table 4 for an example configuration.

Table 4   Example of Default MacSecProfile MO Configuration

| Attribute            | Value                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| replayProtect        | true                          |
| excludedCiphers      | empty                         |
| minimumSecurityLevel | INTEGRITY_AND_CONFIDENTIALITY |
| scope                | ALL_RI_PORTS                  |
| securedEntity        | empty                         |

Figure 2   MACsec on All RI Ports

### 2.3.2 Configuring MACsec on Certain RiLinks

MACsec Configured for Certain RI Links

MACsec can secure only some RI links and leaving the others unsecured. It is also

possible to create separate profiles for different RI links.

If only certain RI links have to be secured, the

MacSecProfile.scope and

MacSecProfile.securedEntity attributes have to be configured

to refer to the RI links that need to be secured.

Table 5   MACsec Configured for Certain RI Links

| Parameter            | Value                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| replayProtect        | true                          |
| excludedCiphers      | empty                         |
| minimumSecurityLevel | INTEGRITY_AND_CONFIDENTIALITY |
| scope                | SPECIFIC_REF                  |
| securedEntity        | RiLink=1,RiLink=2             |

Figure 3   Example of MACsec Secured RiLinks

MACSec Protected RI Links with Separate Profiles

When different RI links have to be secured with different MACsec profiles, a

MacSecProfile MO must be created for each RI link group with

the MacSecProfile.securedEntity attribute referring to the

corresponding RI links.

Table 6   Example of MACsec Configuration for First RiLink Group

| Parameters           | Value                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| replayProtect        | true                          |
| excludedCiphers      | empty                         |
| minimumSecurityLevel | INTEGRITY_AND_CONFIDENTIALITY |
| scope                | SPECIFIC_REF                  |
| securedEntity        | RiLink=1,RiLink=2             |

Table 7   Example of MACsec Configuration for Second RiLink Group

| Parameter            | Value                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| replayProtect        | true                          |
| excludedCiphers      | empty                         |
| minimumSecurityLevel | INTEGRITY_AND_CONFIDENTIALITY |
| scope                | SPECIFIC_REF                  |
| securedEntity        | RiLink=3, RiLink=4            |

Figure 4   Example of MACSec Protected RiLinks with Separate Profiles

### 2.3.3 Modifying Attributes

MACsec can be reconfigured by changing the attributes in the

MacSecProfile MO.

Traffic is affected if any of the following attributes are changed:

- MacSecProfile.minimumSecurityLevel
- MacSecProfile.excludedCiphers
- MacSecProfile.securedEntity

Traffic is not affected if MacSecProfile.replayProtect is not

changed.

### 2.3.4 Delete MacSecProfile MO

Steps

1. Delete MacSecProfile MO. The following system created MOs that are related to the MacSecProfileare deleted automatically: MacSecCp MacSecUcp MacSecCa Note: All RiLink MOs, that the deleted profile referred to, are no longer secured.

# 3 Troubleshooting
