## 1.1 Abis Transport for Baseband Radio Node

![Image](../images/1_1553-LZA7016005Uen.H/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 1   Protocol Model, BSC - Baseband Radio Node

The baseband radio node uses Internet Protocol (IPvX) connectivity

to transport Abis traffic towards the Base Station Controller (BSC).

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is used on top of the IP connection

to transport the Abis Link Access Procedure on the D-channel (LAPD)

frames. The Abis transport service provided by the baseband radio

node acts as a native IP host.

All Abis traffic is carried in the form of LAPD frames. Thus the

LAPD frames contain both Operation and Maintenance Link (OML) and

Radio Signaling Link (RSL) signaling as well as traffic data. An LAPD

frame is identified by its Terminal Endpoint Identifier-values (TEI)

and Service Access Point Identifiervalues (SAPI). The TEI-value defines

Sector \Central Function (SCF) or Transceiver (TRX). The SAPI-value

defines the type of information the frame contains.

All LAPD frames are carried in L2TP tunnels over IP. To save bandwidth

on Abis IP, several LAPD frames are gathered into bigger L2TP packets

called bundles; a bundle is carried on an L2TP transport session which

is called a bundle group. This bundling procedure is controlled by

parameters called transport profiles received from the BSC by the

Abis Managed Object (MO) Abis Transport (AT), for more information

see, User Description, Packet Abis over IP, 326/1553-HSC 103 12/32 Uen.

The transport profiles are used by Abis transport to setup needed

transport sessions for all unlocked TRXs in the GSM Sector ( administrativeState=UNLOCKED on

MO Trx, see Manage Radio Network GSM for TRX unlock and lock). The transport sessions for one or more

TRX carry signaling (OML and RSL) and payload (CS, CSD, and PS).

An Abis transport instance is identified by its key attribute, abisIpId on MO AbisIp, given at instance creation.

## 1.2 LAPD

LAPD is the link layer used for the Operation and Maintenance Link

(OML) and the Radio Signaling Link (RSL). It can be used when signaling

on the Abis interface between BSC and the baseband radio node. As

for the traffic, compressed LAPD frames are used for forwarding the

payload to and from the baseband radio node. Link control is handled

by overlaying protocols Traffic Forwarding Protocol (TFP) and Packet

GPRS Signaling Link (PGSL).

## 1.3 L2TP

Abis transport uses the L2TP to forward LAPD frames to and from

the BSC. The protocol is described in RFC 3931 L2TPv3.

The L2TPv3 is extended with Ericsson proprietary functionality.

The extension supports protocol version negotiation, performance notifications,

configuration of crc32 and bundling of LAPD frames into L2TP packets

using local bundling group concept. The L2TP tunnel consists of one

or more control connections and one or more transport sessions. The

control connections are used to establish and maintain the L2TP tunnel.

The control connection also conveys the transport session configuration

data. One or more transport sessions can be associated to one control

connection.

### 1.3.1 Control Connections

Each message sent on the Control Connection is acknowledged by

the receiving part. Abis transport supports one control connection

for each GSM Sector. The acknowledgment can be either sent as an explicit

acknowledge message or piggybacked on another control message. If

the sending side receives no acknowledgment for a message, the message

is retransmitted according to a defined schema. If it is still not

acknowledged, the connection is deemed to be down, and recovery actions

start.

### 1.3.2 Transport Sessions

Bundling is used on the L2TP transport sessions. A L2TP packet

contains several LAPD frames. The bundle to put an LAPD frame into

is determined by the SAPI value of the LAPD frame. A bundle carries

LAPD frames with one or more SAPI values. With different types of

traffic in different bundles (different transport sessions), prioritization

can be achieved as DSCP values are assigned to the bundles. The sending

of a bundle is triggered when either a size or timer constraint is

fulfilled.

The message on the transport sessions is not acknowledged by the

L2TP.

## 1.4 Abis Transport over Satellite

An overview of the Abis transport over satellite is shown in the

figure.

![Image](../images/1_1553-LZA7016005Uen.H/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 2   Abis Transport over Satellite

Satellites can be used for the transmission (IPvX) of the Abis

traffic between the Baseband Radio Node and the Base Station Controller

(BSC) for both Circuit Switched (CS) and Packet Switched (PS) services.

When satellite transmission is used, a one-way delay of 250 ms

or longer is introduced, which can lead to interruptions on the L2TP

tunnel and the LAPD link.

For the L2TP tunnel, the retransmission and keep-alive procedures

can be adjusted for satellite through the following attributes in

the MO class AbisIp:

- initialRetransmissionPeriodTOOLTIPFLAG
- keepAlivePeriodTOOLTIPFLAG
- maxRetransmissionTOOLTIPFLAG
- retransmissionCapTOOLTIPFLAG

The following LAPD retransmission parameters, used by the Baseband

Radio Node, can be changed through the BSC that is using the LAPD

XID frame:

- N200; maximum number of retransmissions
- T200; delay between retransmissions
- k; maximum number of outstanding frames to change the radio node default transmission parameters for a specific LAPD link

Figure 3   Baseband Radio Node MOM for GSM

The figure shows the Managed Object (MO) classes used to configure

the GSM part of Baseband Radio Node in the Baseband MOM. This section

describes add and configure, unlock, lock, and delete procedures of

MO AbisIp. Configuration instructions

of MO GsmSector and MO Trx are described in Manage Radio Network GSM and configuration instruction of MO AddressIPv4 or MO AddressIPv6 are described in Manage Transport Network.

## 2.1 Add Abis IP

To add MO AbisIp, MO AddressIPvX representing the IPvX address, the baseband radio node use must

be added in advance.

To add MO AbisIp:

1. Add an instance of MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG with the following attributes: Attributes dscpSectorControlULTOOLTIPFLAG, initialRetransmissionPeriodTOOLTIPFLAG, keepAlivePeriodTOOLTIPFLAG, maxRetransmissionTOOLTIPFLAG, and retransmissionCapTOOLTIPFLAG all retrieve default values by the system but could be adapted if needed depending on the link circumstances between the BSC and the baseband radio node.
    - bscBrokerIpAddressTOOLTIPFLAG The BSC IPv4 address used by the GSM Sector when making the initial contact.
    - ipv4AddressTOOLTIPFLAG Reference to MO AddressIPv4 which represents the IPv4 address used by GSM Sector.
    - bscBrokerIpv6AddressTOOLTIPFLAG The BSC IPv6 address used by the GSM Sector when making the initial contact.
    - ipv6AddressTOOLTIPFLAG Reference to MO AddressIPv6 which represents the IPv6 address used by GSM Sector.
    - gsmSectorNameTOOLTIPFLAG The gsmSectorNameTOOLTIPFLAG is used as identification when BSC is connected. The gsmSectorNameTOOLTIPFLAG is sent as attribute HostName in L2TP message SCCRQ. The same unique name must be configured in the BSC. For more information see GSM RAN CPI User Description, Packet Abis over IP, 326/1553-HSC 103 12/32 Uen. Default gsmSectorNameTOOLTIPFLAG is the same as gsmSectorId, last 20 characters.

## 2.3 Unlock
Abis IP

### 2.3.1 IPv4

When MO AbisIp is unlocked, the L2TP control

connection is established and the first L2TP transport session is

setup. The LAPD link (SCF OML) for the GSM Sector is also established

towards the BSC (LAPD establishment is initiated by the BSC).

MO AbisIp attribute operationalState=ENABLED when

L2TP control connection is established for the GSM Sector.

MO GsmSector attribute abisScfOmlState=UP when LAPD (SCF

OML) is established for the GSM Sector.

MO AbisIp attribute peerIpAddress shows the IP address

GSM Sector connected to, is different from bscBrokerIpAddress if L2TP connection

is redirected during unlock or at a later stage.

Check that the transport network is correctly configured by making

sure that the referenced MO AddressIPv4 parent MO InterfaceIPv4 attribute operationalState=ENABLED (see Manage Transport Network).

To unlock the MO AbisIp, get a connection to BSC

the following conditions must apply:

- BSC is ready to accept L2TP control connection and its first transport session, and to initiate the LAPD link for the SCF OML

To unlock MO AbisIp:

1. Set attribute administrativeState=UNLOCKEDTOOLTIPFLAG on MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG.

### 2.3.2 IPv6

When MO AbisIp is unlocked, the L2TP control

connection is established and the first L2TP transport session is

setup. The LAPD link (SCF OML) for the GSM Sector is also established

towards the BSC (LAPD establishment is initiated by the BSC).

MO AbisIp attribute operationalState=ENABLED when

L2TP control connection is established for the GSM Sector.

MO GsmSector attribute abisScfOmlState=UP when LAPD (SCF

OML) is established for the GSM Sector.

MO AbisIp attribute peerIpv6Address shows the IP address

GSM Sector connected to, is different from bscBrokerIpv6Address if L2TP connection

is redirected during unlock or at a later stage.

Check that the transport network is correctly configured by making

sure that the referenced MO AddressIPv6 parent MO InterfaceIPv6 attribute operationalState=ENABLED (see Manage Transport Network).

To unlock the MO AbisIp, get a connection to BSC

the following conditions must apply:

- BSC is ready to accept L2TP control connection and its first transport session, and to initiate the LAPD link for the SCF OML

To unlock MO AbisIp:

1. Set attribute administrativeState=UNLOCKEDTOOLTIPFLAG on MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG.

## 2.4 Lock Abis
IP

When MO AbisIp is locked, L2TP control

connections, all underlying L2TP transport sessions, and all the LAPD

links (SCF OML and TRX OML &amp; RSL) are terminated for the whole

GSM sector towards the BSC.

MO AbisIp attribute operationalState=DISABLED when

L2TP control connection is terminated for the GSM sector.

MO GsmSector attribute abisScfOmlState=DOWN when LAPD

(SCF OML) is terminated for the GSM sector and MO Trx attributes abisTrxcOmlState=DOWN  and abisTrxRslState=DOWN  when the

LAPD links (OML and RSL) are terminated for each of the TRX in the

GSM sector.

To lock AbisIp:

1. Set attribute administrativeState=LOCKEDTOOLTIPFLAG on MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG.

## 2.5 Delete Abis IP

To delete the MO AbisIp, the following conditions

must apply:

- Attribute administrativeState=LOCKEDTOOLTIPFLAG on the MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG.

Note:  The operation is terminated if attribute administrativeState=UNLOCKED when

trying to delete MO AbisIp.

To delete MO AbisIp:

1. Set attribute administrativeState=LOCKEDTOOLTIPFLAG, if unlocked.
2. Delete MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG.

## 2.6 Reconfigure Abis IP from IPv4 to
IPv6

Reconfiguration of MO AbisIp from IPv4 to IPv6 is accomplished

by locking all the MO AbisIp instances with IPv4 configuration on

the Baseband, change the MO AbisIp configuration from IPv4 to IPv6,

and then unlock the MO AbisIp instances one by one.

1. Lock all MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG instances with IPv4 configuration on the Baseband, see Section 2.4.
2. Change the configuration of all MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG instances on the Baseband from IPv4 to IPv6. To change a MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG configuration from IPv4 to IPv6, the following actions must be done in one transaction:
    - Set the bscBrokerIpAddressTOOLTIPFLAG attribute to empty.
    - Set the ipv4AddressTOOLTIPFLAG attribute to empty. This step is not mandatory, but it's recommended to do it.
    - Set the bscBrokerIpv6AddressTOOLTIPFLAG attribute to a correct value.
    - Set the ipv6AddressTOOLTIPFLAG attribute to a correct value.
3. Unlock the MO AbisIpTOOLTIPFLAG instances one by one. See Section 2.3.
