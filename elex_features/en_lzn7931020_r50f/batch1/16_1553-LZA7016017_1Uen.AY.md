# 1 Managing Network Functions

NR network functions in the gNodeB are modeled by the following

MOs:

- GNBCUUPFunction
- GNBCUCPFunction
- GNBDUFunction

For more information on the modeled network functions, see the following documents:

- 3GPP TS 28.541
- The NR Node Functionality section of Node Description

Figure 1   gNodeB Network Functions in Radio Node MOM

These network functions require manual management when setting up the network for the

node to be able to carry traffic. Creating the MOs can be done manually or in the Radio

Network Bulk CM file at node integration.

For more information on node integration, see Integrate Baseband Radio Node.

The MOs representing different network functions must be associated with various

termination points of a given interface to allow the flow of control plane signaling and

user plane traffic. The service discovery function enables the mutual discovery between

network functions and associated services.

Depending on the deployment, the following links need to be set up to ensure proper operation:

| F1-U   |    | Connecting gNodeB-DU and gNodeB-CU-UP.    |
|--------|----|-------------------------------------------|
|        |    |                                           |
| F1-C   |    | Connecting gNodeB-DU and gNodeB-CU-CP.    |
|        |    |                                           |
| E1     |    | Connecting gNodeB-CU-UP and gNodeB-CU-CP. |

## 1.1 F1-C Interface Function

The F1-C interface facilitates a connection between a gNodeB-CU

and a gNodeB-DU.

The F1-C interface has the following functions:

- F1-C interface management
- System information management
- F1 UE context management
- RRC message transfer function
- Paging function
- Information transfer for warning messages
- Optional DTLS function

For the F1-C interface to function as intended, the following prerequisites must be

met:

- A Router MO with two interfaces must be defined in loop-back mode for all radio nodes using F1 communication.
- Two internal IP addresses must be configured.Note: The IP addresses do not need to be routed outside the node.

During the configuration process, the F1-C link uses SCTP association.

## 1.2 F1-U Interface Function

The F1-U interface is the logical link between the gNodeB-CU-UP

and the gNodeB-DU. It enables the transfer of user data between

the endpoints.

The F1-U interface has the following functions:

- User data transfer
- Flow control

## 1.3 E1 Interface Function

The E1 interface is the logical link between a gNodeB-CU-CP and a

gNodeB-CU-UP. It facilitates the exchange of signaling

information between the endpoints. The E1 interface separates the radio network layer

and the transport network layer and enables exchange of UE associated information and

non-UE associated information.

The E1 interface has the following functions:

- E1 interface management
- E1 bearer context management

# 2 Creating NR Network Function MOs at Node Integration

Overview

The NR network function MO instances are created in the Radio Network file by including

the required RPC call. Using ECT to create the Radio Network file ensures that the file

has the necessary form and content.

For examples of creating NR network function MO instances, see Manage Configuration Files.

# 3 Managing Network Function Connectivity

## 3.1 Create Node-internal F1 Link

Prerequisites

A LocalSctpEndpoint must exist on the gNodeB. If it doesn't exist,

create an instance of it.

In embedded deployment, both the F1-C and F1-U links remain internal to the node. The

SCTP association between the gNodeB-CU and the gNodeB-DU must be defined.

Steps

1. Define a Router MO with two interfaces in loop-back mode.
2. Define two SctpEndpoint MOs for the Router MO, each using different addresses. Note: The port number is 38472.
3. Set the LocalSctpEndpoint.interfaceUsed to F1.
4. Set the GNBDUFunction.endpointResourceRef and the GNBCUUPFunction.endpointResourceRef attributes to the EndpointResource MO which has the LocalSctpEndpoint attribute as a member.
5. Set the LocalSctpEndpoint.sctpEndpointRef attribute under the GNBDUFunction and the GNBCUCPFunction MOs to refer to the two SctpEndpoint MO instances.
6. Create the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO.

## 3.2 F1 - Delete TermPointToGNBCUCP

Prerequisites

- TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is locked

To delete the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO:

Steps

1. Delete the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO.

Results

The TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is deleted.

## 3.3 F1 - Unlock TermPointToGNBCUCP

Prerequisites

- TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is locked

To unlock the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO:

Steps

1. Set the TermPointToGNBCUCP.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

Results

- The TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is UNLOCKED.
- The TermPointToGNBDU MO is automatically created.

## 3.4 F1 - Lock TermPointToGNBCUCP

Prerequisites

- TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is unlocked

To lock the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO:

Steps

1. Set the TermPointToGNBCUCP.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.

Results

- The TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is locked.
- The TermPointToGNBDU MO is automatically deleted.
