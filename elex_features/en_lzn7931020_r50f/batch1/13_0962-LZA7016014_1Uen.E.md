"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions 
granted by this License.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is 
based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,

original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works 
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) 
to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of 
the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works 
thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by 
the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on 
behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" 
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor

    2. Grant of Copyright License.

charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute 
the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-
charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license 
to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the 
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such 
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by 
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) 
was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, 
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in 
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

a.You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this 
License; and

b.You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and

c.You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, 
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of 
the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative 
Works; and

d.If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the 
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that 
do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the 
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative 
Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file 
are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your 
own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or 
as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. 

 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
with the conditions stated in this License.
 
    5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the 
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for 
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in 
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or 
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or 
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of 
permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law 
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited 
to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been 
advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance 
of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act 
only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other 
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work

To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, 
with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own identifying 
information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the 
appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a file or 
class name and description of purpose be included on the same "printed page" as the 
copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.
