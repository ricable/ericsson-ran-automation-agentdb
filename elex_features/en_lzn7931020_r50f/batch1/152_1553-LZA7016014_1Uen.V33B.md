# 1 Overview of Radio Units

Radio units provide modulation and demodulation of RAN Compute unit signals to various

Radio Frequency (RF) bands,

as well as

RF

power amplification, and filtering.

Radio units are represented under Equipment MO instances by

FieldReplaceableUnit MO instances.

## 1.1 Add, Configure, and Unlock a Radio Unit

Radio units are represented by and configured through the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO.

Radio units are represented by

FieldReplaceableUnit MO instances.

Prerequisites

- The Equipment MO exists.
- The radio unit is physically connected to the RAN Compute unit.

Steps

1. Create a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance. Note: The FieldReplaceableUnit MO is created with the following attribute values: The FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute is set to LOCKED. The FieldReplaceableUnit.availabilityStatus attribute is first set to OFF\_LINE, then it becomes empty. After the FieldReplaceableUnit.availabilityStatus becomes empty, the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED. The optical indicator on the radio unit indicates full maintenance mode.
2. Create an instance of the RiPort MO under the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the RAN Compute unit. Note: The RiPort MO represents the physical port connecting the RAN Compute unit with the radio unit.
3. Create an instance of the RiPort MO under the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit. Note: The RiPort MO represents the physical port connecting the radio unit with the RAN Compute unit.
4. Create an instance of the RiLink MO under the Equipment MO.
5. Set the RiLink.riPortRef1 and RiLink.riPortRef2 attributes to reference the RiPort MO instances. Note: The configuration of the RiLink MO depends on the fronthaul connection used. For more information on the configuration of fronthaul connections, see Manage Hardware Equipment.
6. Ensure that the radio unit represented by the FieldReplaceableUnit MO is physically connected to the RAN Compute unit. Note: If the physical connection is established, the system starts up the radio unit. Then, the FieldReplaceableUnit.availabilityStatus becomes empty and the FieldReplaceableUnit.availabilityStatus is set to ENABLED.
7. Ensure by monitoring the optical indicator on the replaced radio unit that the radio unit is in full maintenance mode before unlocking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
8. Ensure that the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.
9. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED. Note: When locking or unlocking a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing a shared radio unit, all Baseband Radio Nodes sharing the radio unit are affected. For more information on shared radio units, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.

Results

The system updates the

FieldReplaceableUnit.productData attribute to contain

information about the physically connected radio unit.

The system selects the software that matches the radio unit. The

system begins loading, starting up, and configuring the radio unit.

An HwItem MO instance is created for the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the radio unit under the

HwInventory MO. The HwItem MO instance is

updated with data retrieved from the physical radio unit.

The optical indicators indicate that the radio unit is in

operational mode. If the radio unit supports the "Here I Am" indication, an instance

of the HereIAmIndication MO is created under the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the radio unit. For more

information on the "Here I Am" indication, see Site Diagnostics.

If the radio unit is capable of power measurement, the energy

meter represented by the EnergyMeter MO is included in the value

of the ConsumedEnergyMeasurement.noOfContributingUnits attribute.

This allows data collection for performance statistics. If there is no energy meter

to represent, the EnergyMeter.availabilityStatus attribute is set

to NOT\_INSTALLED.

If the radio unit is capable of measuring radio processing

observability or measuring transmission power off time, the system creates an

instance of the RadioProcessing MO under the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the radio unit. The

RadioProcessing MO collects data on performance

statistics.

An SfpModule MO instance is created under the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO for each RiPort MO

instance that represents an RI port that is physically on an SFP module. When the

SfpModule MO instances are created, the

SfpModule.administrativeState attribute is set to

UNLOCKED for each SfpModule MO instance. The

RiPort.sfpModuleRef attribute is updated to reference the

associated SfpModule MO instances.

An HwItem MO instance is created for each

SfpModule MO instance under the

HwInventory MO. For each channel used in the SFP, an

SfpChannel MO instance is created under the

SfpModule MO. The RiPort.channelRef

attribute is updated to reference the associated SfpChannel MO

instances.

When the physical connection is established between the SFP module

and the RI port on the physical equipment, the related MO instances are updated. The

HwItem MO instances are updated for each

SfpModule MO instance. In addition, for each

RiPort MO instance related to an SfpModule

MO instance, the SfpModule attributes are updated in the

following way:

- The SfpModule.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.
- The SfpModule.availabilityState attribute becomes empty.
- The SfpModule.productData attribute is updated to contain information about the installed SFP module.

For each RiPort MO instance representing an RI

port with Ethernet transmission standard, an EthernetPort MO

instance is created with the following configurations:

- The EthernetPort.macAddress attribute stores the MAC address to the RI port.
- The EthernetPort.encapsulation attribute references the RiPort MO instance.
- The EthernetPort.administrativeState attribute is set to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Radio ports can be configured with the following MOs under the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO:

- The RfPort MO for Remote radio units.
- The Transceiver MO for Massive MIMO radio units.

## 1.2 Restart Radio Unit

Steps

1. Perform the FieldReplaceableUnit.restartUnit action.
2. Set the restartRank parameter. Table 1 Radio Units, Related MOs and Use of restartRank Parameter Type of Radio Unit Related MOs Use of restartRank Parameter Radio FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is not in use. Radio Dot FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is not in use. AIR FieldReplaceableUnit Parameter is possible to be set. Parameter is not in use.
3. Set the restartReason parameter.
4. Set the restartInfo parameter for logging reasons. The restartInfo parameter is an optional free-text field where extra information can be added. Note: The following characters are not allowed in the restartInfo field: ; (semicolon) &amp; (ampersand) &lt; (less than) &gt; (greater than) New line Carriage return
![Image](../images/152_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.V33B/additional_3_CP.png)

## 1.3 Replace Radio Unit

Radio units can be replaced by locking the FieldReplaceableUnit

MO

instance, following the radio-specific

replacement

instructions, and unlocking the FieldReplaceableUnit

MO

instance.

Steps

1. If the radio unit needs to be replaced because of a fault, identify the alarming radio unit. The alarm is raised on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that represents the faulty radio unit.
2. Restart the radio unit. For information on how to restart the radio unit, see Restart Radio Unit.
3. Lock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit by setting the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED. Note: When locking or unlocking a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing a shared radio unit, all Baseband Radio Nodes sharing the radio unit are affected. For more information on shared radio units, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide. Result: If the radio unit is faulty, locking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit suppresses the alarm.
4. Ensure by monitoring the optical indicator that the radio unit goes into full maintenance mode after locking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
5. Issue a work order for a site visit to replace the radio unit. The work order must contain information for the site technician on the type of the radio unit to help identify the radio unit on site. Note: If the radio unit is detected as faulty, the fault optical indicator is on. If the radio unit supports the "Here I Am" indication, the HereIAmIndication MO can be configured to make the optical indicators blink to help identify the faulty radio unit. For more information on the "Here I Am" indication, see Site Diagnostics.
6. Send a technician to the site to replace the radio unit. For information on how to replace the radio unit, see the relevant Replace Radio document. The system loads and configures the installed radio unit based on the existing MO configuration. The installed radio unit is represented by a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance. The FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.
7. Ensure by monitoring the optical indicator on the replaced radio unit that the radio unit is in full maintenance mode before unlocking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
8. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the installed radio unit. Note: When locking or unlocking a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing a shared radio unit, all Baseband Radio Nodes sharing the radio unit are affected. For more information on shared radio units, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.

Results

- If an alarm was raised because of a faulty radio unit, the alarm is ceased after the radio unit is replaced.
- The FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute displays ENABLED.
- The network traffic is handled by the installed radio unit.

## 1.4 Remove Radio Unit from Sector Configuration

A radio unit can be removed from the sector configuration by removing

the related MOs, and removing the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance

representing the radio unit.

Steps

1. Set the SectorEquipmentFunction.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Remove the MO instances that are associated with the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
    - If the radio unit is Massive MIMO, remove the Transceiver MO instances that are associated with the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
    - If the radio unit is Remote, remove the RfBranch MO instances that are associated with the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
3. Remove or keep the physical radio unit.
    - If the physical radio unit is removed, go to Step 4.
    - If the physical radio unit is kept, go to Step 6.
4. Remove the RiLink MO instances that are associated with the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit.
5. Remove the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit and all its child MOs.
6. Set the SectorEquipmentFunction.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

Results

The radio unit is removed from the sector configuration.

## 1.5 Multiband Radio

It is possible to configure the antenna system of a dual-band or multiband radio unit.

This is done by setting the value of the RfBranch.bandList attribute

to the desired value. The RfBranch.bandList attribute is responsible

for the identification the specific band that the RfBranch

class             works on.

The following rules are applicable to populate the RfBranch.bandList

attribute:

- ATMA is in use with dual-band radio
- Diplex is in use with dual-band radio
- ATMA or Diplex is not in use with dual-band radio

Dual-Band Radio with ATMA

When ATMA is in use with dual-band radio, two RfBranch instances

are created for each RfPort instance. The

RfBranch.bandList attribute populates as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Dual-Band Radio with ATMA MO Structure

Dual-Band Radio with Diplex

When Diplex is in use with dual-band radio, two RfBranch instances

are created for each RfPort instance. The

RfBranch.bandList attribute populates as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Dual-Band Radio with Diplex MO Structure

Dual-Band Radio without ATMA or Diplex

When ATMA or Diplex is not in use with dual-band radio, the following options are

available:

- Two RfBranch instances are created for one RfPort instance. The RfBranch.bandList attribute populates as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 Dual-Band Radio without ATMA or Diplex MO Structure 1
- One RfBranch instance is created for one RfPort instance. The RfBranch.bandList attribute populates as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 Dual-Band Radio without ATMA or Diplex MO Structure 2

## 1.6 Radio Unit Support for Baseband Radio Nodes

The Baseband software UP contains a list of supported radios (product number and

R-state). The UP also contains the latest available radio software for these supported

types or revisions (the latest radio software version available at the release of the

UP). More information can be found in Manage Software.

The Baseband Radio Node checks the product number and R-state of all connected radios and

performs the following:

- If radio unit type and R-state can be found in the compatibility list, the radio is accepted and if necessary the radio software is automatically upgraded. Note: Radio software upgrade can require downloading modules of the upgrade package. If it is not possible to reach the source indicated by the UpgradePackage MO, download is not possible, and the alarm Software Management Lost Connection to File Server is raised. When the connection is reestablished and the alarm is ceased, the radio unit must be restarted to trigger the download of the required modules.
- If the radio cannot be found in the compatibility list, the Baseband Radio Node accepts the radio but supports the pre-installed software, it does not attempt to upgrade the radio software. Instead the Baseband Radio Node uses the pre-installed radio software, most often factory-installed software.
- If the radio cannot be found in the compatibility list and the radio, the Baseband Radio Node does not support the pre-installed software, it is not able to use the connected radio.

## 1.7 Optical Indicator Control

The Optical Indicator Control feature allows for immediately activating and deactivating

the optical indicators on units. The feature also allows for temporarily activating the

optical indicators on a specific unit.

Deactivating the optical indicators turns off all optical indicators regardless of other

settings. The following indications are overridden:

- 'Here I Am' indication
- Indication of maintenance mode initiated using the maintenance button
- Hardware restart initiated using the maintenance button

Activating the optical indicators restores the correct optical indicator states.

## 1.8 Configure Operator-Provided Radio Serial Number

The operator-provided radio serial number can be configured using the

FieldReplaceableUnit.preferredHwIdentity attribute. This is useful

for validating cabling configuration and identifying misconnected cables during

installation.

Configuring the FieldReplaceableUnit.preferredHwIdentity attribute

is optional. Not configuring the attribute or configuring the attribute to an empty

string results in no operator-provided serial number for the radio unit.

Steps

1. Check the FieldReplaceableUnit.productData.serialNumber attribute to obtain the serial number of the radio unit. Note: The FieldReplaceableUnit.productData.serialNumber attribute can only be used if a connection is already established with the radio unit.
    - If the serial number of the radio unit is successfully obtained, go to Step 4.
    - If the serial number of the radio unit is cannot be obtained, go to Step 2.
2. Send a technician to site.
3. Obtain the serial number of the radio unit.
4. Create an instance of the FieldReplaceableUnit.preferredHwIdentity attribute on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the radio unit.
5. Set the operator-provided radio serial number using the FieldReplaceableUnit.preferredHwIdentity attribute. Note: The operator-provided radio serial number must match the serial number of the radio unit.
6. Restart the Baseband Radio Node. A warm restart is recommended.
7. Verify that no alarms are raised due to faulty cabling.
    - If an alarm is raised, see the specific Alarm OPI documents.
    - If the MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm is raised, see MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment.

## 1.9 Hardware Inventory History Log

The Hardware Inventory History Log allows the tracking of hardware replacements and

reconfigurations. Reconfigurations are only detected for hardware units with a serial

number.

Hardware reconfiguration occurs when a hardware unit is moved from its current position

to another occupied position.

If a RAN Compute unit is replaced, the log is restored on the new unit.

The log contains the following information of the replaced hardware unit:

- Additional text, which contains information if a replacement or reconfiguration is performed
- Name of the MO instance representing the hardware
- Hardware product name
- Hardware product number
- Hardware product revision
- Hardware product serial number

The log is stored at rcs/saf\_log/HWInvHistoryLog.

# 2 Sector Management

Sectors can be configured through the SectorEquipmentFunction

MO.

A sector is a geographical area spanned by the transmission angle from

an

antenna or a group of antennas. It is composed of one or more sector

carriers, each serving one cell in a specific frequency band.

Sector

carriers

provide the

possibility to cover a geographical area.

The configuration of each sector is stored in the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO. The frequency band covered by the

sector is controlled by the capability of the radio unit connected to the

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO.

## 2.1 Add and Unlock a Sector

## 3.4 Radio Power Sharing

Radio power sharing increases the performance of radio units by allowing a higher

configurable output power than the nominal output power of the radio unit.

Table 2   Use Cases of Radio Power Sharing

| Use Case                                                                                                                                    | Benefits of Enabled Radio Power Sharing                                                      | Limitations                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planned output power of the radio unit is lower than or equal to the                                 nominal output power of the radio unit | Increased cell coverage     Increased cell range     Increased cell volume     Increased SNR | Not applicable                                                                                                                       |
| Planned output power of the radio unit is higher than the nominal                             output power of the radio unit                | Decreased energy consumption                                                                 | Radio power sharing must not be enabled when the traffic load is very                                 high, for example in stadiums. |

If the output power exceeds the hardware capabilities, radio power sharing limits

downlink traffic on the carrier branch to prevent overshoot and protect hardware

components. The FreqBandData.pmNoOfPwrOBLimSlots PM counter can be

used to track the impact on downlink traffic.

Radio power sharing capability is specified for each radio unit. For more information on

hardware support for radio power sharing, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

Radio power sharing supports configurations with Radio Gateway.

For information on how to configure radio power sharing, see Manage Radio Network.

Radio Power Sharing in Mixed Mode

Radio power sharing can only be configured through a Baseband Radio Node in LTE or NR

mode.

If a radio unit is connected to multiple Baseband Radio Nodes, enabling radio power

sharing on one Baseband Radio Node automatically activates radio power sharing on

the radio unit. To disable radio power sharing on the radio unit, radio power

sharing must be disabled on all connected Baseband Radio Nodes in LTE or NR

mode.

Radio power sharing supports mixed mode configurations with all RATs. For GSM, WCDMA,

and NB-IoT RATs, radio power sharing can only be enabled if one of the Baseband

Radio Nodes connected to the radio unit is in LTE or NR mode, which allow the

configuration of radio power sharing.

## 3.5 Unit-Specific Information for Remote Radio Units with External Antenna

### 3.5.1 Sector Carrier Specification for Different 8TX/8RX Radios

Some 8TX/8RX radios can support multiple LMC modes. This configuration option can

help maximize number of available sector carriers, as different LMC modes support a

different number of sector carriers.

#### 3.5.1.1 Sector Carrier Specification for Radio 8823 B42

Radio 8823 B42 supports LTE-only and LTE + NR LMC.

If a Radio 8823 B42 is upgraded to NR LMC, the number of supported sector carriers is

reduced from five to three. Because of this, it is possible to reconfigure Radio 8823

B42 in LTE-only and LTE + NR LMC modes where five sector carriers are still

supported.

Table 7   Supported Number of Sector Carriers for Each LMC for Radio 8823 B42

| LMC      |   Supported Number of Sector Carriers |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| LTE-only |                                     5 |
| LTE + NR |                                     3 |

To support switching between multiple LMCs, the following requirements must be

fulfilled:

- Unused carriers must be deleted, including cases in which Baseband units are removed in mixed mode configuration.
- In configurations where two Baseband units are connected to a radio, both Baseband units are upgraded.
- The radio does not share sectors with another radio.

#### 3.5.1.2 Sector Carrier Specification for Radio 8818 B41E

Radio 8818 B41E supports both LTE-only and LTE + NR LMC.

If a Radio 8818 B41E is configured to LTE + NR LMC mode, the number of supported sector

carriers is reduced from three to two. When the Radio 8818 B41E is reconfigured to

LTE-only LMC mode, three sector carriers are still supported.

### 3.5.2 Limitations for Radio 8823 and Radio 8836

The following limitations apply to Radio 8823 and Radio 8836:

- In single-mode NR Only the same FSO is supported on the same radio unit. Non-zero FSO is not supported. The only supported TDD pattern is DDDSUUDDDD.
- In LTE-NR mixed-mode configuration Only FSO=0 ms is supported for both RATs. The only supported TDD pattern is DDDSUUDDDD.

# 4 AIR

The AIR is a hardware unit that integrates one or more radio units, and the antenna. It

can replace separate antennas and radios for one sector with a single physical unit.

Some AIR units also include RET function.

Several types of AIR units are distinguished, for example, for classic macro radio

function or beamforming. The AIR units for beamforming are in mid-band or high-band

frequency segment.

For more information on the AIR hardware and for detailed description of the AIR unit

types, see Antenna Integrated Radio Unit Description.

Some AIR units are equipped with antennas including both an active and a passive side,

where the passive side acts as a standard antenna and connects to external radio unit

with optional TMA and Bias-Tee unit. The use of the passive part is optional.

Configuration and Fault Management of AIR

The AIR unit does not have a maintenance button. For maintenance or service reasons,

the included units must be locked remotely.

In case of two physical radio units inside the AIR unit, the locking procedure locks

both radios at the same time. All standards from all baseband units are affected by

the locking.

The AIR unit with RET function can be configured with or without RET cascading.

If a hardware failure alarm is received from internal hardware components, these units

are handled differently based on the type of the AIR unit.

For example, the following methods can be applicable depending on the AIR type and

the alarm:

- SFP is a replacement unit installed in the AIR unit which can be replaced on-site.
- For the AIR 2488, the internal radio unit or internal radio units can be handled separately and can be replaced on-site. If another internal part sends a failure alarm that requires the replacement of that part, the whole unit must be replaced.

FR1 AAS units supporting up to six carriers can trigger automatic restart to free up

for internal resource relation if reconfiguring carrier with bandwidth up to 50 MHz

to a larger carrier. Dependencies are due to possible internal resource

fragmentation in case of many other carriers are configured.

Mixed Mode Configurations for Remote Radio Unit with Integrated Antenna

The AIR 11 is not used in Mixed Mode configurations.

In case of the AIR 21 and LTE + GSM Mixed Mode Radio configuration, one of the

built-in radios can be configured for Mixed Mode Radio and the other built-in radio

for single mode.

## 4.1 MO Overview of Massive MIMO Radio Units

Figure 7   MO Overview of Massive MIMO Radio Units

Figure 8   Example for MO to Hardware Mapping of Massive MIMO Radio Units

## 4.2 Add, Configure, and Unlock a Transceiver MO

The Transceiver MO can be created and configured under the

FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing a Massive MIMO radio

unit.

Prerequisites

- An instance of the FieldReplaceableUnit MO representing the Massive MIMO radio unit exists.
- The radio unit is physically connected to the RAN Compute unit.

Steps

1. Create an instance of the Transceiver MO under the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit. Note: A Transceiver MO instance is created with the following attribute values: The Transceiver.availabilityStatus attribute is set to OFF\_LINE. The Transceiver.operationalState attribute is first set to DISABLED, then set to the appropriate value depending on the MO validation. If the MO validation succeeds, the Transceiver.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED. If the MO validation fails, the Transceiver.operationalState attribute is set to DISABLED, the Transceiver.availabilityStatus is set to FAILED, and an alarm might be raised.

Results

- The configured Transceiver MO instance can be used to manage the antenna streams it represents.
- Collection of performance statistics data starts if the radio unit associated with the Transceiver MO instance is a multi-band Massive MIMO radio unit capable of measuring transmission power off time. Data is collected through the Transceiver MO.

## 4.3 Remove a Transceiver MO

The Transceiver MO can be removed by removing the related MO

references, and removing

the

Transceiver

MO instance.

The Transceiver MO can be removed to suppress alarms or when the

downlink and uplink antenna streams the Transceiver MO represents

are no longer used on the Massive MIMO radio unit.

Steps

1. If the Transceiver MO instance is referenced in an RfBranch.rfPortRef attribute under the SectorEquipmentFunction MO, set the SectorEquipmentFunction.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Remove all references to the Transceiver MO instance.
3. Delete the Transceiver MO instance.

Results

The Transceiver

MO

instance is removed from the configuration.

## 4.4 Fronthaul Sharing Configuration

Up to three AIR units can be used in a fronthaul sharing configuration. This

configuration is applicable for RBS with AIR 1281, AIR 5322, or Indoor AIR 1279. In this

configuration, the system groups the resources mapped to each AIR unit to common streams

towards the Baseband unit. The Baseband unit then transmits or receives resources on a

certain beam in a certain radio.

The CPRI links from the Baseband unit are connected to data ports

1 and 3 on the first AIR unit, and

reach the next AIR unit through data ports 2 and

4.

CPRI line rates can be 10.1 Gbps or 24.3 Gbps. Mixing CPRI rates is not supported.

In a fronthaul sharing configuration, the maximum CPRI cable length between the Baseband

unit and first AIR is 13 km. The total maximum distance between first AIR unit and last

AIR unit is 200 m, regardless of the number of deployed AIR units.

Fronthaul Sharing Deployment Cases

The direction of the CPRI cascade chain is determined by the

SectorEquipmentFunction.radioEquipmentOrdering attribute. The

default value is CIRCLE\_COUNTER\_CLOCKWISE.

Fault Handling and Fault Observability

If an AIR unit experiences a fault in the cascading chain, the cell service is

degraded or unavailable, depending on the fault and the location on the unit in the

cascaded chain.

The cell service is degraded in the following cases:

- If the penultimate or last AIR unit is locked or experiences a fault. Faults can be hardware fault, permanent power loss, link, or SFP failure or critical temperature. In this case, the preceding operational AIR provides cell service.
- If any AIR unit experiences a partial Hardware fault or reports overheating, the remaining operational AIR units provide cell service.
- If one or more AIR units do not start up or are unavailable when the node is started or a locked SectorEquipmentFunction MO is unlocked, preceding operational units provide cell service.

The cell service is unavailable if the first AIR unit is locked, or experiences a

fault. Faults can be hardware fault, permanent power loss, link, or SFP failure or

critical temperature.

An alarm is raised to identify the faulty or late starting unit and the nature of the

fault.

When a previously unavailable AIR unit becomes operational, the alarm is ceased. If

all AIR units are unlocked and operational, full cell service is regained

automatically after a traffic interrupt. No manual release or traffic reactivation

is needed.

### 4.4.1 Fronthaul Sharing Configuration Modes

In a fronthaul sharing deployment, the antenna segmentation is supported for AIR

units with the configuration modes shown in Table 8.

Table 8   Configuration Modes

| AIR Unit        | Configuration Mode                               |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Indoor AIR 1279 | Configuration Mode 1 with 8CC, 800 MHz bandwidth |
| AIR 1281        | Configuration Mode 1 with 8CC, 800 MHz bandwidth |
| AIR 1281        | Configuration Mode 2 with 4CC, 400 MHz bandwidth |
| AIR 5322        | Configuration Mode 1 with 8CC, 800 MHz bandwidth |

Steps

- Configure a preferred antenna segmentation in fronthaul sharing units by following the instructions described in Add AasData MO Class on Indoor AIR 1279, AIR 1281, Streetmacro 6701, and AIR 5322.

## 4.5 RET Control in an AIR

In AIR units without RET cascading, the active side RET is controlled by the active side of

the node. The passive side RET is controlled by the passive side of the node.

In AIR units with RET cascading, the RETs can be controlled by either the active or passive

connected DUW or Baseband Radio node for any standard or standards.

Alternatively,

the RET control can be divided between the active and the passive nodes. However, one RET can

be controlled by only one node. The RET control depends on the number of RETs inside the AIR

unit:

- In AIR units with two RETs, it is not possible to split the RET control. The connected node must be configured so that both RETs are controlled by either the active node or the passive node.
- In AIR units with three RETs the RET control can be split, so one RET can be controlled by one node and the two other RETs by the other node. It is also possible to control all RETs by one node (either active or passive). Note: RET cascading can be configured for the active side only. When an LTE node is on the passive side, it requires two external radios to control all the three RETs (one radio with both RF ports A and B, and one radio with RF port A or B). When a WCDMA node is on the passive side, it requires three independent external radios to control all the three RETs.

### 4.5.1 Configure Cascading RETs in AIR

In AIR RET can be used either as an external or internal unit which can be cascaded.

Prerequisites

Before configuring cascaded RET units, the RET Support feature has to be

enabled. For AIR unit types and R-states that do not support RET cascading, see Antenna Integrated Radio Unit Description.

Steps

1. Create two AntennaNearUnit MO instances related to an AntennaUnitGroup MO.
2. Set the iuantDeviceType attribute to Single RET (S-RET) or Multi RET (M-RET) depending on RET configuration.
3. Set the rfPortRef attribute to RfPort=R.
4. Set the uniqueId to A1 for the active side, and P1 for the passive side.
5. Create one RetSubUnit MO instance for each AntennaNearUnit MO, and set the same ID for both.
6. Create two AntennaSubUnit under AntennaUnit MO.
7. Restart all DUs in the AIR, starting from the last one in the cascade chain.

### 4.5.2 Swap RET Control in AIR

In AIR units with RET cascading, RET control can be transferred from the active side to the

passive side, or the other way round.

Steps

1. Remove the RET-specific MO instances in the node which currently controls the RET instances.
2. Restart the radio that previously controlled the RET.
3. Configure the RET units in the node to where the RET control is transferred.
4. Restart the radio that is now configured to control the RET.

## 4.6 Interleaved AIR

Interleaved AIR is a concept that combines a passive antenna with an Interleaved AIR

unit. Interleaved AIR units can be used in the following configurations:

| Interleaved   |    | The Interleaved AIR unit is used in combination with a passive                             antenna.   |
|---------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                       |
| Standalone    |    | The Interleaved AIR unit is used without a passive antenna.                                           |

For more information, see Interleaved AIR Description.

If the Interleaved AIR unit is used in interleaved configuration, the

Transceiver.interleavedAirInstallation attribute must be set to

true.

For AIR 6428, the value of the Transceiver.interleavedAirInstallation

attribute is automatically detected and overwritten if it is misconfigured.

## 4.7 Unit-Specific Information for Massive MIMO Radio Units

### 4.7.1 Specifications for AIR 5331

Figure 11   AIR 5331 and Baseband 6630

Steps

1. Connect DATA\_1, or both DATA\_1 and DATA\_2 to Baseband 6630 for component carriers 1-2.
2. Then additionally connect either DATA\_3 or DATA\_4, or both DATA\_3 and DATA\_4 to Baseband 6630 for component carriers 3-4. It is not supported to connect the unit only on ports DATA\_3 and DATA\_4 of AIR5331, connection to DATA\_1 and DATA\_2 is required. Multiple Digital Unit connections to the unit are not supported. The recommended setting is to connect all four DATA ports. Note: Traffic loss can occur during AIR unit calibration. If a new NRSectorCarrier MO is created during operation (after the initial configuration), traffic will be lost on all cells using the same AIR unit.

If a new NRSectorCarrier MO is configured and unlocked during operation (after the initial configuration), traffic is lost on all cells using the same AIR unit.

#### 4.7.5.1 Add AasData MO Class on Indoor AIR 1279, AIR 1281, AIR 5322, Streetmacro 6701, and Streetmacro 6705

The AasData MO Class is created under the

Transceiver MO Class to support a requested antenna segmentation and

to show the system-selected antenna segmentation.

When the requested antenna segmentation is default or not supported by the AIR unit,

the system automatically selects an antenna segmentation and sets a corresponding

configuration mode in the unit. When the requested antenna segmentation is supported

by the AIR unit, the system sets the corresponding configuration mode in the unit.

The selected antenna segmentation corresponds to the configuration mode in the

unit.

Prerequisites

The SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute contains a

reference to one or three Transceiver MO

instances.

Steps

1. Create an instance of the AasData MO under the Transceiver MO Class representing an AIR unit associated with an NRSectorCarrier MO.
2. Set the AasData.antSegmentation attribute depending on the number of NRSectorCarrier MOs and their aggregated operational bandwidth to be placed on the AIR unit and the characteristics for each configuration mode. AasData.antSegmentation(1) Description AUTO The node determines the antenna segmentation based on the aggregated sector carriers associated with the radio. The system selects SPLIT\_H\_50\_50 when the following conditions are met: Two to eight component carriers are configured with mixed or matching bandwidths. The frequency separation of the aggregated carriers fits within the operating bandwidth for two segments. WHOLE\_100(2) An antenna segmentation is requested with one segment (Configuration Mode 2). The node fits up to four component carriers with mixed or matching bandwidths, and with the frequency separation of the aggregated carriers fitting within the operating bandwidth of the segment. SPLIT\_H\_50\_50 An antenna segmentation is required with two segments (Configuration Mode 1). The node fits up to eight component carriers with mixed or matching bandwidths per segment, and with the frequency separation of the aggregated carriers fitting within the operating bandwidth of both segments. (1) For the Indoor AIR 1279 unit, the AUTO and the SPLIT\_H\_50\_50 values are applicable. (2) WHOLE\_100 is not supported in a fronthaul sharing configuration for AIR 5322. If the AasData.antSegmentation attribute is not set or not supported by the radio, the system defaults to AUTO, and no alarm is raised. For details on the radio characteristics for each Configuration Mode, see the Technical Data chapter in the radio unit description. In a fronthaul sharing configuration, the same AasData.antSegmentation attribute must be set under the Transceiver MO for each fronthaul sharing unit associated with the NRSectorCarrier MO. The system sets the used antenna segmentation in the AasData.usedAntSegmentation attribute for each fronthaul sharing unit. An alarm is raised on the MO for the sector carrier of each unallocated component carrier in the following cases: The number of configured component carriers exceed the maximum supported limit for the selected antenna segmentation. The higher bandwidth edge of the aggregated carriers exceeds the operating bandwidth. Note: The fronthaul sharing configuration is not supported for Streetmacro 6701 and Streetmacro 6705.
3. Set the SectorEquipmentFunction MO associated with the Transceiver MO to locked.
4. Set the SectorEquipmentFunction MO to unlocked.

Results

The selected antenna segmentation is shown in the

AasData.usedAntSegmentation attribute.

#### 4.7.5.2 Configuration Modes for Indoor AIR 1279, AIR 1281, AIR 5322, Streetmacro 6701, and Streetmacro 6705

The Indoor AIR 1279, AIR 1281, AIR 5322, Streetmacro 6701, and Streetmacro 6705 units

have one PAAM that can be split into sections to provide flexible deployment use cases with

one hardware.

(1)

Indoor AIR 1279 only supports configurations with

Configuration Mode 1 and two PAAM segments used in AIR.

(2)

Each sector carrier with 100 MHz bandwidth.

(3)

It is recommended that all configured carriers have the same

bandwidth-to-power ratio. When an unequal number of carriers

is allocated in radio segments, the recommended power

setting for each carrier is the lowest maximum power that

can be set for each carrier.

(1)

Each sector carrier with 100 MHz bandwidth.

(2)

It is recommended that all configured carriers have the same

bandwidth-to-power ratio. When an unequal number of carriers

is allocated in radio segments, the recommended power

setting for each carrier is the lowest maximum power that

can be set for each carrier.

(3)

This configuration is only applicable to one of the PAAM

segments.

(7)

Each sector carrier with 100 MHz bandwidth.

(8)

It is recommended that all configured carriers have the same

bandwidth-to-power ratio. When an unequal number of carriers

is allocated in radio segments, the recommended power

setting for each carrier is the lowest maximum power that

can be set for each carrier.

(9)

This configuration is only applicable to one of the PAAM

segments.

(1)

Each sector carrier with 100 MHz bandwidth.

(2)

It is recommended that all configured carriers have the

same bandwidth-to-power ratio. When an unequal number of

carriers is allocated in radio segments, the recommended

power setting for each carrier is the lowest maximum

power that can be set for each carrier.

(3)

This configuration is only applicable to one of the PAAM

segments.

### 4.7.6 Specifications for AIR 3218, AIR 3219, AIR 3229, AIR 3236, AIR 3258, AIR 3263, AIR 3283 RET, and Digital Tilt Configuration

In Macro, Macro\_Narrow\_H33 and Hotspot scenarios, RET and digital tilt configurations

refer to MOM configurations.

Macro and Macro\_Narrow\_H33 Scenarios for RET and Digital Tilt

Configuration

The combination of digital tilt and RET provides the tilt range pairing for the

following AIR units:

- AIR 3218
- AIR 3219
- AIR 3229
- AIR 3236
- AIR 3258
- AIR 3263
- AIR 3283

The digital tilt setting is the same as the target downtilt direction. Digital

tilt must be set to the same value on all sector carriers, even with MORAN

configuration.

For NR, the value of the CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt attribute

affects downtilt and the CommonBeamforming.cbfMacroTaperType

attribute sets the type of tapering for vertical beam weights.

For LTE, the value of the SectorCarrier.digitalTilt attribute

affects downtilt and the SectorCarrier.verticalTaperType

attribute sets the type of tapering for vertical beam weights.

In the following tables, the RET setting column refers to the configuration of the

RetSubUnit.electricalAntennaTilt attribute:

### 4.7.9 Tx Restriction

Tx restriction applies to AIR 6472 B77G B77M dual band radio unit. Tx restriction

prevents transmission in the restricted B77G band of the radio unit when there is no

transmission in the unrestricted B77M band.

Tx restriction raises the MO Configuration Pending Action

alarm with the Unlock at least one NRSectorCarrier MO instance in

unrestricted band which shares MO listed in Additional Information with alarming MO.

Lock and unlock alarming MO. additional text in the following

cases:

- When every NRSectorCarrier MO instance stops transmitting in the unrestricted band of a radio unit. In this case, the restricted band automatically stops transmitting and raises the alarm on the relevant NRSectorCarrier MO instances.
- When there is an attempt to unlock an NRSectorCarrier MO in the restricted band of a radio unit, and there is no transmission in the unrestricted band. This is also applicable to the corresponding NRCellDU MO.

To avoid raising alarms, do the following:

- To start transmission in the restricted band, see Start Transmission in Restricted Band.
- To stop transmission in the unrestricted band, see Stop Transmission in Unrestricted Band.

For information on how to handle alarms raised by Tx restriction, see MO Configuration Pending Action.

#### 4.7.9.1 Start Transmission in Restricted Band

Prerequisites

The radio unit does not transmit in the restricted and unrestricted bands.

Steps

1. Unlock at least one NRSectorCarrier MO instance in the unrestricted band.
2. Unlock the parent NRCellDU MO in the unrestricted band.
3. Unlock the NRSectorCarrier MO instances in the restricted band.
4. Unlock the parent NRCellDU MO in the restricted band.

#### 4.7.9.2 Stop Transmission in Unrestricted Band

Prerequisites

The radio unit transmits in both the restricted and unrestricted bands.

Steps

1. Lock all the NRSectorCarrier MO instances in the restricted band, or lock the parent NRCellDU MO.
2. Lock the NRSectorCarrier MO instances in the unrestricted band, or lock the parent NRCellDU MO.

# 5 CPRI and eCPRI

CPRI and eCPRI are industry standards that both define a flexible interface between

Baseband units and radio units. The CPRI and the eCPRI specifications also enable

flexible and efficient product differentiation for RBSs.

The main differences between the CPRI and the eCPRI specifications are the following:

- CPRI establishes the connection between radio units and Baseband units on the Layer 1 and Layer 2 levels.
- eCPRI establishes the connection between radio units and Baseband units through a packet-based fronthaul network.

## 5.1 CPRI Overview

A CPRI link is a point-to-point connection on the Layer 1 and Layer 2 levels, where the

Baseband unit acts as the primary port and the radio unit acts as the secondary port.

All the information that flows between the Baseband unit and the radio unit is

multiplexed to a digital serial communication line between the Baseband unit and the

radio unit. A CPRI link can also function as a link between system architectures that

supports the network.

Protocol Overview

CPRI defines the Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols for the transfer of user plane,

control and management plane, and synchronization information between the Baseband

unit and the radio unit, as well as between two radio units. Figure 13 provides an overview of the basic

protocol hierarchy of CPRI.

Figure 13   CPRI Protocol Overview

The CPRI interface supports the following types of information flows:

| IQ Data                     |    | User plane information in the form of in-phase and QAM data (digital                             baseband signals).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The user plane information is sent in the form of In-Phase and Quadrature (IQ) Data.

The IQ Data of different antenna carriers are multiplexed by a time division

multiplexing scheme to an electrical or optical transmission line.

The control and management data is sent as in-band protocol (for time critical

signaling data) or by Layer 3 protocols (not defined by CPRI) that reside on top of

appropriate Layer 2 protocols. Two different Layer 2 protocols for Control &amp;

Management Data - subset of High-Level Data Control Link (HDLC) and Ethernet - are

supported by CPRI. These additional control and management data are time multiplexed

with the IQ Data. Additional time slots are available for the transfer of any type

of vendor-specific information.

Observability

The following parameters are associated with CPRI observability on the Baseband Radio

Node:

- RiLink.operationalState
- RiLink.linkRate

The following PM counters are associated with CPRI observability on the Baseband

Radio Node:

- RiLink.pmCableDelayHigh
- RiLink.pmCableDelayLow
- RiLink.pmLinkDelayHigh
- RiLink.pmLinkDelayLow
- RiLink.pmLinkRestart
- RiLink.pmLinkStabilityError
- RiPort.pmBitError
- RiPort.pmLossOfFrame
- RiPort.pmLossOfSignal

### 5.1.1 CPRI Compression

CPRI Compression increases the capacity of the LTE air bandwidth for one Baseband

CPRI link by up to 50%.

CPRI Compression increases the capacity of the LTE air bandwidth for one Baseband CPRI

link with up to 50%. CPRI Compression is available for LTE FDD and TDD in configurations

with Baseband and for radio types that support CPRI compression. This function also

supports configurations including Baseband R503 and radio group 6.

This function has the following benefits:

- Up to 480 MHz LTE air bandwidth is supported on one single CPRI.
- The LTE air bandwidth is not limited by the sum bandwidth capacity of the CPRI links.

The following groups of Ericsson radios support CPRI compression:

- Radios that benefit from up to 25% capacity by enabling CPRI Compression using radio group 3b and radio group 5b. For information about the radio groups, see Radio Node Configurations.
- Radios that benefit from up to 50% capacity by enabling CPRI compression using radio group 6.

CPRI compression is enabled by default.

To be able to change the CPRI compression state, the CpriLinkIqData MO

must be created manually. The CpriLinkIqData.cpriCompression

attribute is used to change the CPRI compression state for the carrier branches on the

RiLink. The RiLink MO instance is listed in the

CpriLinkIqData.riLinkRef attribute.

### 5.1.2 CPRI Cascading

The CPRI cascading configuration for radio units enables to connect more radio units

to one Baseband CPRI link port. This reduces equipment costs and simplifies the antenna

equipment setup.

CPRI cascading supports radio units to be cascaded in the following ways:

- Two or more single mode radio units are connected in a cascade chain.
- One or several mixed mode radio units and one single mode radio unit is connected in a cascade chain. For more information, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide and Cascadable Radio Units.

The CPRI connections between radio units must be between CPRI port DATA\_1 of a radio and

port DATA\_2 of another radio unit.

Figure 14   Example of CPRI Connections in Radio Cascade Chain

### 5.1.3 PM Counter for Extended Delay Change

The pmCpriExtDelayChange PM counter counts

the number of times

an

extended delay change on a CPRI

link results in

cell service reset. When the counter is stepped, an entry is written

in the availability log.

Delay over extended delay threshold on the CPRI link is

observed in the following two dimensions with the

pmCpriExtDelayChange counter:

- PM counter
- Availability log entry.

Operators can also use the

pmCpriExtDelayChange PM counter for statistical data collection

and for creating counter thresholds in Ericsson Network Manager to generate alarms. To create

counter thresholds:

1. Create a user defined KPI for the PM counter.
2. Set an alarm with the KPI threshold in Ericsson Network Manager.

## 5.2 eCPRI Overview

An eCPRI link is a packet-based connection, where the Baseband unit acts as the primary

port and the radio acts as the secondary port. An eCPRI link does not

constrain the use of network-layer and data link-layer protocols to form the connection.

Any type of network can be used for eCPRI as long as the requirements defined in the

eCPRI specification are fulfilled.

An eCPRI link makes it possible to decrease the data rate demands between the Baseband

unit and the radio. This is done through a flexible functional decomposition

while limiting the complexity of the radio. In addition, the eCPRI downlink

traffic is optimized in one 10 Gbps link with the following updates:

- 60 MHz bandwidth
- 23 downlink layers

Although CPRI and eCPRI can coexist in the same system, eCPRI is not backward compatible

with CPRI.

Protocol Overview

eCPRI defines a protocol for the transfer of user plane information between the

Baseband unit and the radio through a packet-based fronthaul transport

network. The interface supports Ethernet-switched or IP-routed fronthaul networks.

Figure 15 provides an overview of the

basic protocol hierarchy for Ethernet- or IP-based eCPRI transport cases.

Observability

The following MO classes are associated with eCPRI observability on the Baseband

Radio Node:

- RiLink
- EthernetPort Note: The associated counters are only supported if the EthernetPort MO instance encapsulates an RiPort MO instance.

The following PM counters are associated with the RiLink MO:

- RiLink.pmCableDelayHigh
- RiLink.pmCableDelayLow
- RiLink.pmLinkStabilityError

The following counters are supported if an EthernetPort MO

instance encapsulates an RiPort MO instance:

- ifHCInBroadcastPkts
- ifHCInMulticastPkts
- ifHCInOctets
- ifHCInUcastPkts
- ifHCOutBroadcastPkts
- ifHCOutMulticastPkts
- ifHCOutOctets
- ifHCOutUcastPkts
- ifInErrors
- ifInOctetRatePercentiles
- ifOutErrors
- ifOutOctetRatePercentiles
- pmLossOfSignal

## 5.3 CPRI and eCPRI Length Limitation

The CPRI and eCPRI link length is limited when using an optical fiber and an optical

SFP module.

CPRI and eCPRI can support an optical fiber length up to 15 km when using optical fiber

and an optical SFP module. If the optical fiber length exceeds 15 km, cells might stop

taking traffic.

The fiber length is limited by the latency requirement. The assumed one-way single fiber

latency between the Baseband and the radio is 75 µs. This translates to a maximum of 15

km fiber length if there is direct cable connection. One router switch has a latency of

2-5 µs, and a 5 µs latency equals to 1 km of fiber length.

The CPRI and eCPRI link length limitation is valid for all RATs and overrides the length

supported by the SFP.

For further details, see NR Optical Fronthaul Solution Guideline  in the NR

RAN library.

# 6 External Alarms on Radio Units

External

alarms are

issued

for external equipment connected to the external alarm ports on the radio unit. External

alarms can be configured through the AlarmPort MO.

External alarms are

issued

for external equipment connected to the external alarm ports on the radio unit.

External alarms can be raised in the following cases:

- The supervision limit is exceeded on the radio unit.
- A fault condition exists on the radio unit.

An external alarm

can be configured by creating, updating, and

unlocking an AlarmPort MO instance and its attributes. This MO

instance represents the physical external alarm port on the radio unit and

it

must

be created under the relevant FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance.

Additional information in the external alarm is based on the configuration of the

corresponding AlarmPort MO

instance

on the Baseband Radio Node.

The

system updates the external alarm filter when the value of the

AlarmPort.filterAlgorithm attribute is set to

Auto. The following attributes are used for

calculating

the external alarm filter:

- AlarmPort.filterTime
- AlarmPort.filterDelay

The attributes can be used to filter out short events and

low-frequency

toggling alarms, in which time between the alarms is more than 60 seconds.

External equipment is connected to the radio unit external alarm ports

using

external

alarm

cables

as

described in the Radio Description for the corresponding radio

unit.

## 6.1 Add, Configure, and Unlock the Alarm Port for a Radio Unit

An alarm port can be added, configured, and unlocked for a radio unit through the

AlarmPort MO.

The

AlarmPort MO represents

a

physical alarm port on a radio unit. The

AlarmPort MO can be created and configured to enable raising

external alarms for the radio unit.

Prerequisites

- The FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute of the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit is set to ENABLED.
- The radio unit is equipped with a physical external alarm port.

Steps

1. Create an AlarmPort MO instance under the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit.
2. Set the AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED. Note: The created and locked AlarmPort MO has the following attribute settings: The AlarmPort.availabilityStatus attribute is empty. The AlarmPort.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.
3. Configure the following attributes: AlarmPort.alarmSlogan AlarmPort.normallyOpen AlarmPort.perceivedSeverity Note: If the attributes are configured on an AlarmPort MO instance that has the AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute set to UNLOCKED, the system rejects the configuration.
4. Set the AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

Results

External alarms can be raised on the unlocked AlarmPort

MO

instance if conditions are fulfilled for raising an external

alarm.

## 6.2 Remove the Alarm Port for a Radio Unit

An alarm port of a radio unit can be removed by removing the

AlarmPort

MO

instance

under the FieldReplaceableUnit

MO

instance representing the radio unit.

Prerequisites

The value of the AlarmPort.administrativeState attribute of the

AlarmPort MO instance under the

FieldReplaceableUnit

MO

instance representing the radio unit is set to

LOCKED.

Steps

1. Remove the AlarmPort MO instance under the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit.

# 7 Configuration Examples

## 7.1 Configuration Flow

The configuration flow consists of creating the following files:

- A configuration template file that can be reused for multiple nodes
- A site-specific configuration file, which is created by populating the template file with site-specific parameters

Template files can be created in one of the following ways:

- Using the Configuration Generator for automatic template creation with the ECT or a plug-in in the Auto Provisioning application of the ENM.
- Creating new XML NETCONF files.

The preferred procedure is to use the Configuration Generator. Only edit the template file

with an XML editor if the required configuration is not supported by the tool.

When the preferred configuration procedure is used, it is not necessary to understand the MO

structure. However, for maintenance and troubleshooting, the MO structure must be

understood.

For more information on configuration methods, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool. For more information on

configuration files, see Manage Configuration Files.

## 7.2 Additional Configurations

Site Equipment Example Files

Additional configuration that is not generated with the basic configuration method

can be implemented from site equipment example files. This section includes

configuration that is only available in site equipment example files.

## 7.3 Configuring Radio Units and Antenna System with the Basic Configuration Method

The basic configuration method uses RBBs and ABBs as input parameters, as specified in

Building Blocks. The ECT generates a NETCONF configuration

file with the required MO elements based on input parameters provided through GUI.

## 7.4 Configuration for 4TX/4RX Radios in Combination with Four-Port Antenna Units

To ensure that the antennas are correctly connected to the antenna ports and have a

stable polarization pattern for common channel beamforming, the following connections

must be aligned with each other:

- The physical cabling, that connects the following ports: The external antenna ports on the antenna unit. These ports are defined in the corresponding AuPort MO instances. The antenna feeder ports on the radio. These ports are defined in the corresponding RfPort MO instances.
- The physical and virtual connection between the cell and the RBS equipment

The order of the RfBranch MO references under the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO must be configured to ensure that the

connection between the RAN Compute unit ports and the antenna external ports is aligned

with the chosen physical cabling pattern. This can be configured through the

corresponding RfBranch.rfPortRef and

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes.

The physical cabling patterns can be, for example, one of the following ABBs:

- ABB4\_1A Figure 17 ABB4\_1A Cabling Pattern
- ABB4\_1B Figure 18 ABB4\_1B Cabling Pattern
- ABB4\_2A Figure 19 ABB4\_2A Cabling Pattern
- ABB4\_2B Figure 20 ABB4\_2B Cabling Pattern

These ABBs support both 4TX/4RX and 2 × 2TX/2RX operations. The 2 × 2TX/2RX

operation is supported because of increased virtual IBW.

Regardless of the chosen cabling, the first two RfBranch MO references

must correspond to the AuPort MOs with one polarization in a

left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit. The last two

RfBranch MO references must correspond to the

AuPort MOs with the other polarization, also in a left-to-right

order.

The physical cabling for connecting the 4TX/4RX radios with four-port antenna units must

be aligned with the MO configurations to have the proper antenna polarization

pattern.

For ABB4\_1A and ABB4\_2A cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A and RfPort=C, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=B and RfPort=D, in that order, must be connected to the other polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

For ABB4\_1B and ABB4\_2B cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A and RfPort=B, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

## 7.5 Configuration for 8TX/8RX Radios in Combination with Eight-Port Antenna Units

To ensure that the antennas are correctly connected to the antenna ports and have a

stable polarization pattern for common channel beamforming, the following connections

must be aligned with each other:

- The physical cabling, that connects the following ports: The external antenna ports on the antenna unit. These ports are defined in the corresponding AuPort MO instances. The antenna feeder ports on the radio. These ports are defined in the corresponding RfPort MO instances.
- The physical and virtual connection between the cell and the RBS equipment

The order of the RfBranch MO references under the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO must be configured to ensure that the

connection between the RAN Compute unit ports and the antenna external ports is aligned

with the chosen physical cabling pattern. This can be configured through the

corresponding RfBranch.rfPortRef and

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes.

The physical cabling patterns can be, for example, one of the following ABBs:

- ABB8\_1A Figure 21 ABB8\_1A Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_1B Figure 22 ABB8\_1B Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_2A Figure 23 ABB8\_2A Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_2B Figure 24 ABB8\_2B Cabling Pattern

These ABBs support both 8TX/8RX and 2 × 4TX/4RX operations. The 2 × 4TX/4RX

operation is supported because of increased virtual IBW.

Regardless of the chosen cabling, the first four RfBranch MO

references must correspond to the AuPort MOs with one polarization in

a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit. The last four

RfBranch MO references must correspond to the

AuPort MOs with the other polarization, also in a left-to-right

order.

The physical cabling for connecting the 8TX/8RX radios with eight-port antenna units must

be aligned with the MO configurations to have the proper antenna polarization

pattern.

For ABB8\_1A and ABB8\_2A cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A, RfPort=B, RfPort=E, and RfPort=F, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=C, RfPort=D, RfPort=G, and RfPort=H, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

For ABB8\_1B and ABB8\_2B cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A to RfPort=D, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=E to RfPort=H, in that order, must be connected to the other polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

## 7.6 Configuration Examples for 1TX/1RX and 1TX/2RX Radio Units

Sector equipment functions are used to configure the system by involving the used

RfBranches MOs in the SectorEquipmentFunction

MO. One or two RfBranch MOs are added if the

RfPort MO of the RfBranch MO is capable of TX

and RX.

In case of 1TX/1RX and 1TX/2RX solutions, multiple RfBranch MOs are

added, for one TX capability port.

1TX/1RX Setup on 2TX/2RX Radio

The SectorEquipmentFunction MO is created from the configuration

to follow the different coverage.

Figure 25   1TX/1RX Sector Equipment Function on 2TX/2RX Radio

When antenna units cover different areas, the following alternatives are

supported:

- Configuring one SectorEquipmentFunction parent MO that has one RfBranch child MO
- On multi-sector per radio, configuring the SectorEquipmentFunction=1 and SectorEquipmentFunction=2 MOs

1TX/1RX Setup on 2TX/4RX Radio

Figure 26   1TX/1RX Sector Equipment Function on 2TX/4RX Radio

1TX/1RX Setup on 4TX/4RX Radio

Figure 27   1TX/1RX Sector Equipment Function on 4TX/4RX Radio

1TX/2RX Setup on 2TX/2RX Radio

The SectorEquipmentFunction MO can be configured with two

RfBranch child MOs, where each RfBranch MO

refers to one RfPort MO on the radio unit. If one of the

RfBranch MOs is named

&lt;name&gt;\_NO\_TX, the TX direction on that

port is disabled. The system allocates RX direction to that port, and 1TX/2RX is

configured.
