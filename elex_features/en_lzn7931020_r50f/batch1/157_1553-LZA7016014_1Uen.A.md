# 1 Fronthaul Overview

In RAN architectures, CPRI and eCPRI transport is used separately or together, between

Baseband units, radio units, and other fronthaul equipment. The fronthaul equipment

improves the following aspects of the connection to ensure high radio performance:

- Effectiveness
- Quality
- Reliability

## 1.1 Additional Information

The CPRI and eCPRI line rates depend on the used equipment. To set the CPRI and eCPRI

line rates, see the MOM CPI.

For detailed information about the supported CPRI and eCPRI line rates, see the following

documents:

- Manage Software
- DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity
- Supported Radio Capabilities

For more information about fronthaul capacity related to radio configurations, see Fronthaul.

For more information, see the appropriate Baseband unit or RAN Compute unit

description.

# 2 Passive Fronthaul

Passive fronthaul is achieved between two ports of fronthaul equipment by installing and

modeling direct cable connections or Fronthaul 6000 solutions.

Passive fronthaul is always modeled as an RiLink MO.

## 2.1 Configure Direct Cable Connection

Steps

1. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the remote unit.
2. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the unit interfacing the remote unit. The FieldReplaceableUnit MO can represent one of the following units: Baseband Baseband P Baseband R LC-05 9xCPRI line card in conversion mode Radio Gateway Radio Processor RAN Processor A radio unit in a cascade chain
3. Create an instance of the RiLink MO.
4. Connect the previously created RiPort MO instances with the RiLink MO instance. Note: The names of the RiPort MO instances must reflect the names of the ports to which the cable is connected.

Results

The connection towards the remote unit is configured.

## 2.2 Configure Fronthaul 6000 Connection

Steps

1. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the remote unit.
2. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the unit interfacing the remote unit. The FieldReplaceableUnit MO can represent one of the following units: Baseband Baseband P Baseband R Radio Processor RAN Processor A radio unit in a cascade chain
3. Create an RiLink MO instance.
4. Connect the previously created RiPort MO instances with the RiLink MO instance. Note: The names of the RiPort MO instances must reflect the names of the ports to which the cable is connected. The fronthaul equipment connects two RiPort MO endpoints with the RiLink MO.

Results

The connection towards the remote unit is configured.

Fronthaul 6080 Passive Technical Product Description in

the Ericsson Fronthaul 6000 library.

# 3 Packet Fronthaul

This section describes how to configure and manage connections between Baseband Radio

Nodes and radio units connected over packet fronthaul equipment.

## 3.1 Configure Point-to-Point Packet Fronthaul

A connection toward the radio unit or Router 6673 can be configured using an LC-05

9xCPRI line card in conversion mode. For more information, see LC-05 9xCPRI

Card Conversion Mode in the Ericsson R6000 library.

Prerequisites

- If topology-identity-based radio integration is performed, a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent with the Interface-ID option is configured on each router port connected to a radio unit. For more information on how to configure a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent on router ports, see DHCP in the Ericsson R6000 library.
- The router port connected to the Baseband unit and the router port connected to the radio unit or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card form an Ethernet Layer 2 segment. For more information, see Bridging and EVPN in the Ericsson R6000 library.

Steps

1. Create a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that presents a radio unit or LC-05 9xCPRI line card.
2. Lock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
3. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute to reference the cabinet or the HwGroup MO where the radio unit is placed.
4. Optional: Create a NetworkIdentity MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO and perform one of the following radio unit integration methods: Radio Unit Integration Method Description Equipment-Identity-Based Radio Unit Integration This method uses the serial number of radio units. Set the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute to match the serial number of the radio unit. Topology-Identity-Based Radio Unit Integration This method uses custom identities specified in the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute. The following requirements apply to the configuration of the radio identities: The attribute type is an array of non-empty strings. Each string is a case-sensitive free text containing only alphanumerical characters, dashes, and underscores. The maximum length of a string is 255 characters. Each string must be unique in the parent NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute and other NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attributes on the node. The NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute must contain the Interface-ID option values of all router ports connected to the unit represented by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO. If the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute is configured incorrectly, the configuration is rejected with a message that indicates the reason for the rejection. Note: Both integration methods can be configured at the same time, but equipment-identity-based radio integration takes precedence over topology-identity-based radio integration.
5. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio unit or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card.
6. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the unit interfacing the radio unit or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card. The FieldReplaceableUnit MO can represent one of the following units: Baseband Radio Processor RAN Processor
7. Create an RiNetwork MO instance.
8. Create an RiLink MO instance.
9. Connect the previously created RiLink MO instance with the RiNetwork MO instance and the RiPort MO instance. The RiPort MO instance is on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the unit that acts as an interface to the radio unit or LC-05 9xCPRI line card.
10. Create an RiLink MO instance.
11. Connect the RiLink MO instance with the RiNetwork MO and the RiPort MO instance, which is on the FieldReplaceablUnit that represents the radio unit or LC-05 9xCPRI line card.
12. Unlock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.

Results

The connection towards the radio unit or the Router 6673 with LC-05 9xCPRI line card

is configured.

## 3.2 Configure Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

This procedure enables Baseband connection towards multiple radio unit RI ports

connected to the same Baseband RI port. The identity of the radio unit that is used

in the point-to-multipoint fronthaul network is determined through the serial number

of the radio unit or the custom identities of network equipment ports that are

connected to the radio unit. For more information, see Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul.

Prerequisites

- If topology-identity-based radio integration is performed, a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent with the Interface-ID option is configured on each router port connected to a radio unit. For more information on how to configure a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent on router ports, see DHCP in the Ericsson R6000 library.
- The router port connected to the Baseband unit and the router ports connected to the connecting radio units form an Ethernet Layer 2 segment. For more information, see Bridging and EVPN in the Ericsson R6000 library.

Steps

1. Create an FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance for each radio unit.
2. Lock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio unit.
3. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.positionRef attribute to reference the cabinet or HwGroup MO where each radio unit is placed.
4. Create a NetworkIdentity MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO and perform one of the following radio unit integration methods: Radio Unit Integration Method Description Equipment-Identity-Based Radio Unit Integration This method uses the serial number of radio units. Set the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute to match the serial numbers of the radio units. Topology-Identity-Based Radio Unit Integration This method uses custom identities specified in the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute. The following requirements apply to the configuration of the radio identities: The attribute type is an array of non-empty strings. Each string is a case-sensitive free text using only alphanumerical characters, dashes, and underscores. The maximum length of a string is 255 characters. Each string must be unique in the parent NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute and other NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attributes on the node. The NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute must contain the Interface-ID option values of all router ports connected to the unit represented by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO. If the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute is configured incorrectly, the configuration is rejected with a message that indicates the reason for rejection. Note: Both integration methods can be configured at the same time, but equipment-identity-based radio integration takes precedence over topology-identity-based radio integration.
5. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio unit for each radio unit RI port.
6. Create an RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the unit interfacing the radio unit.
7. Create an RiNetwork MO instance. Note: The same RiNetwork MO instance is used for all radio units connected to the same Baseband RiPort MO.
8. Create an RiLink MO instance.
9. Connect the RiLink MO instance with the RiNetwork MO instance and the RiPort MO instance.The RiPort MO instance is on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the unit interfacing the radio unit.
10. Create an RiLink MO instance for each RiPort MO on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio unit.
11. Connect each RiLink MO instance with the RiNetwork MO instance and the RiPort MO instance on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio unit.
12. Unlock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio unit.

Results

The connection between a RAN Compute unit and multiple radio units is configured.

Example 4

information about Router 6673, see Technical Product Description in the

Ericsson R6000 library.

### 3.2.1 Replace a Radio Unit in Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

To replace the radio unit safely, the following procedure must be followed:

Steps

1. If the radio unit needs to be replaced because of a fault, identify the alarming radio unit. The alarm is raised on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that represents the faulty radio unit.
2. Lock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit by setting the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED. Note: When locking or unlocking a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing a shared radio unit, all Baseband Radio Nodes sharing the radio unit are affected. For more information on shared radio units, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide. Result: If the radio unit is faulty, locking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the radio unit suppresses the alarm.
3. Ensure by monitoring the optical indicator that the radio unit goes into full maintenance mode after locking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
4. Issue a work order for a site visit to replace the radio unit. The work order must contain information for the site technician on the type of the radio unit to help identify the radio unit on site. Note: If the radio unit is detected as faulty, the fault optical indicator is on. If the radio unit supports the "Here I Am" indication, the HereIAmIndication MO can be configured to make the optical indicators blink to help identify the faulty radio unit. For more information on the "Here I Am" indication, see Site Diagnostics.
5. Send a technician to the site to replace the radio unit. For information on how to replace the radio unit, see the relevant Replace Radio document.

For equipment-identity-based radio unit integration, perform the following

steps:

6. Set the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute to match the serial number of the new radio unit.
7. Ensure that the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED and no alarms are raised on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO. The system loads and configures the installed radio unit based on the existing MO configuration. The installed radio unit is represented by a FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance.
8. Ensure by monitoring the optical indicator on the replaced radio unit that the radio unit is in full maintenance mode before unlocking the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
9. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance representing the installed radio unit.

## 3.3 Migrate from Equipment-Identity-Based to Topology-Identity-Based Radio Integration

It is recommended to switch from equipment-identity-based to topology-identity-based

radio integration to avoid obtaining the radio unit serial number during its

replacement. If equipment-identity-based radio integration is configured on the

node, the migration to topology-identity-based radio integration is helped by the

automatic configuration of the

NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute with

Interface-ID option values of router ports connected to the

unit that is represented by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit

MO.

Prerequisites

- Equipment-identity-based radio integration is configured for the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
- The node is upgraded to a release that supports topology-identity-based radio integration.
- A Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent with the Interface-ID option is configured on each router port that is connected to the unit represented by the parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO. For more information on how to configure a Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent on router ports, see DHCP in the Ericsson R6000 library. Interface-ID option values must be unique between router ports.

Steps

1. Create a backup of the Baseband Radio Node.
2. Verify that the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute is configured correctly. The NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute values must contain the Interface-ID option values of all router ports connected to the unit that is represented by the FieldReplaceableUnit MO. If the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute is not configured with the expected values, go to Step 9.
3. Lock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio units.
4. Remove the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute of the NetworkIdentity child MO. Note: This action causes traffic disturbance on the unit associated with the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.
5. Unlock the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the radio units.
6. Verify that the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED. If the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is not set to ENABLED, go to Step 7. If the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED, go to Step 8. Note: It is important to wait for an appropriate amount of time before verifying the state of the FieldReplaceableUnit.operationalState attribute.
7. Reinstall the Baseband Radio Node backup.
8. Verify that no alarms are raised because of faulty cabling. If an alarm is raised, see the specific alarm OPI documentation for remedy actions.

In case of any issues, do the following:

9. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
