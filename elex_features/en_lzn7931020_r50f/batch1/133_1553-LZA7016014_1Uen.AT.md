# 1 Introduction to Ericsson Site Assistant Application

Ericsson Site Assistant is a mobile application that guides on-site technicians to

perform node integration and validation.

The Ericsson Site Assistant application is available in the Ericsson Software Gateway and

the Managed Play Store to be downloaded and distributed to the user. For installing the

application on a mobile device, see mobile device system requirements in System Requirements of Ericsson Site Assistant Application.

With the Ericsson Site Assistant application, the user can perform the following

tasks:

- Upgrade the network loader to the latest version available on the application
- View and download the network loader log
- Launch and supervise the Zero Touch autointegration process through the autointegration web GUI
- Launch and supervise the LMT integration process through the autointegration web GUI
- Validate the node integration
- Submit or delete a security gateway address on a Baseband unitNote: This option is only valid for Zero Touch integration.
- Tie a configuration prepared in ENM to a specific Baseband unit
- Configure and validate a MINI-LINK 6352 node
- Configure and validate a MINI-LINK 6355 or 6356 node

## 1.1 System Requirements of Ericsson Site Assistant Application

Users must be aware of certain limitations of the Ericsson Site Assistant (ESA)

application.

The following points must be considered when using the application:

- The ESA application is only supported on versions 8-14 of the Android operating system. Note: Versions 13 and 14 are recommended.
- If the mobile device supports the dual apps functionality, it is recommended to disable it. This functionality might interfere with certain functions in the ESA application, causing them to stop working.
- EMGUI can be accessed directly through the ESA application through username and password authentication. For certificate-based authentication, a standard web browser must be used, as the ESA application does not support the loading of certificates on mobile devices.

# 2 Install Ericsson Site Assistant Application

Download and install Ericsson Site Assistant (ESA) on the mobile device.

- The mobile device has the supported version of the Android operating system.

Steps

1. Download the .apk file to your mobile device.
2. Tap the downloaded file to install the application.
3. Open the application.
4. Approve application required permissions in the pop-up window.

# 3 Uninstall Ericsson Site Assistant Application

Steps

- Uninstall the Ericsson Site Assistant application from the mobile device according to the recommended way by Android.
