# 2 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: No PTP messages

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards a PTP Boundary Clock or

directly connected grandmaster is present for more than one minute.

Prerequisites

- The Network Synchronization Plan is available.
- The Transmission Plan is available.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Make sure that the PTP configuration complies with the Network Synchronization Plan. In particular, consider the following possible alarm causes:
    - Verify that the current PTP slave belongs to the PTP domain specified in the Network Synchronization Plan.
    - If a VlanPort MO is configured on the EthernetPort used for PTP, verify the accordance of the configuration with the procedures described in Manage Network Synchronization and Manage Transport Network.
3. After making changes to the configuration, wait for 2 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Ensure that the transport network is configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
5. After making changes to the configuration, wait for 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Verify the connectivity toward the PTP Grandmaster, using ping under the MO Router.

If the alarm remains but there is connection toward the PTP Grandmaster, go to

Step 9.

If there

is no connection toward the PTP Grandmaster, do the following:

7. Contact the maintenance center for the PTP Grandmaster. Request them to ensure that the PTP Grandmaster is configured in accordance with the ITU-T G.8275.2 or the Network Synchronization Plan and that the PTP Grandmaster is enabled.
8. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: No granted service from PTP Grandmaster

The alarm is raised when a reachability problem towards Synchronization server is

present for more than two hours.

The fault can be caused by the following:

- Unicast negotiation is denied or canceled by PTP Grandmaster.
- No unicast negotiation response is received from PTP Grandmaster.

If no standby synchronization reference is available, the fault can

stop or disturb the network synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the associatedGrandmasterPtpBcOcPort is configured in accordance with the attribute in MO Network Synchronization Plan.

If the value of associatedGrandmaster is in accordance with

the Network Synchronization Plan, go to Step 4.

If the value of associatedGrandmaster is not in accordance

with the Network Synchronization Plan, do the following:

3. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Ensure that the attribute domainNumber in MO BoundaryOrdinaryClock is configured in accordance with the domainNumber of the grandmaster.
5. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. attribute in MOContact the maintenance center for the PTP Grandmaster. Request them to ensure that the PTP Grandmaster is configured in accordance with the ITU-T G.8275.2 or the Network Synchronization Plan and that the PTP Grandmaster is enabled.
7. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for RadioEquipmentClockReference: PTP Grandmaster cannot be resolved

The alarm is raised when there is a reachability problem towards the Synchronization

server for more than two hours.

The fault can be caused by the following:

- IP network problems.
- Communication problem.
- Error in domain name configuration.
- Error in DNS client configuration.
- DNS server is unreachable.

If no standby synchronization reference is available, the fault can

stop or disturb the network synchronization.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Ensure that the attribute assosiatedGrandmaster in MO PtpBcOcPort is configured with domain name in accordance with the Network Synchronization Plan.

If it is a valid domain name, go to Step 4.

If it is not a valid domain name, do the following:

3. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Examine the value of the serverAddress attribute in MO DnsClient to be configured in accordance with the Transmission Plan.
5. After making changes to the configuration, wait for at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Verify the connectivity toward the DNS server, using ping under the MO Router.

If the alarm remains but there is no connection toward the DNS server, go to

Step 9.

If there is connection toward the DNS server, do the following:

7. Contact the maintenance center for that DNS server. Request them to act on the fault. The DNS service can be disabled or no record can be found for the domain name.
8. Wait for the confirmation from the maintenance center. After the confirmation, wait at least 5 minutes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
