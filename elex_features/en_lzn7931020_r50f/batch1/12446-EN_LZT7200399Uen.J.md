# 1 Introduction

All radio products transmit Radio Frequency (RF) Electromagnetic

Fields (EMF). Very high RF EMF exposure levels can be harmful. To

protect people against such harmful effects, RF EMF exposure limits

including wide safety margins are specified by national and international

authorities, like ICNIRP, European Council, FCC and Health Canada.

This document provides general information on RF EMF exposure from

antennas either integrated in or connected to a radio product. In

the Radio Description Ericsson provides compliance boundaries, which

define minimum separation distances to be kept between antennas and

people in different directions, for typical configurations of the

radio products. For other configurations, such as different power

levels and antennas, or when the radio product is installed on a site

near other radio sources and antennas, it is necessary to evaluate

the relevant RF EMF exposure levels. Methods are presented here that

can be used to determine compliance boundaries. Furthermore, this

document includes RF EMF related guidelines for installation and maintenance

work close to radio products as well as general public safety recommendations.

## 1.1 Target Group

This document is intended for engineering personnel who create

site installation documentation for RBSs used in the following mobile

communication systems:

- GSM
- CDMA
- WCDMA
- LTE
- NR

# 2 RF EMF Exposure Limits

Various national and international RF EMF regulations, standards,

and recommendations exist that are relevant for radio products. The

limits defined in these standards are similar and are often based

on international guidelines set by the International Commission on

Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which is recognized by

the World Health Organization (WHO). The ICNIRP guidelines have been

incorporated in the European Council recommendation 1999/519/EC and

in the EU Directive 2013/35, as well as in national regulations in

many countries.

ICNIRP provides basic restrictions for both occupational and general

public exposure to electromagnetic fields that must not be exceeded

in any near-field or far-field exposure situation. These restrictions

are based directly on established health effects and defined with

wide safety margins to prevent from whole-body heat stress and excessive

localized tissue heating.

Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and Absorbed Power Density (APD)

are used to specify the basic restrictions in the frequency range

10 MHz to 300 GHz. The SAR is a measure of the rate of RF energy absorption

by the body, expressed in units of watts per kilogram of tissue (W/kg).

Whole-body SAR is averaged over the whole body while local SAR is

defined as the maximum SAR averaged over any 10 g of

tissue. The APD is a measure of the power absorbed superficially in

tissues, with the unit watts per square meter (W/m2),

and is used to specify the basic restrictions for local exposure above

6 GHz. Local APD is averaged over 4 cm2.

The ICNIRP (2020) basic restrictions, which are summarized in  Table 1, incorporate safety factors of up to about 10 for

occupational exposure and up to about 50 for general public exposure.

Whole-body SAR is to be averaged over 30 minutes and local SAR and

APD are to be averaged over 6 minutes.

|                        |   Whole-body SAR (W/kg)  10 MHz – 300 GHz |   Local SAR 10g (W/kg)(1)  10 MHz – 6 GHz |   Local APD 4 cm2 (W/m2)(2)  6 GHz – 300 GHz |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| General Public         |                                      0.08 |                                         2 |                                           20 |
| Occupational (workers) |                                      0.4  |                                        10 |                                          100 |

(1)  The limits provided on local SAR are

for head and trunk. Local SAR limits for limbs are twice as high.

(2)  In addition,

above 30 GHz the APD, averaged over 1 cm2, shall not

exceed two times the tabulated values.

So called reference levels are also provided for simple comparison

with measured values of physical quantities. In the frequency range

10 MHz to 2 GHz the reference levels are expressed as electric field

strength (V/m), magnetic field strength (A/m), and incident power

density (W/m2). Above 2 GHz the reference levels are

only specified as incident power density. The ICNIRP whole-body power

density reference levels for general public and occupational exposure,

with an averaging time of 30 minutes, are summarized in  Table 2. ICNIRP (2020) also provides a separate set of

reference levels for local exposure, with an averaging time of six

minutes.

|                        | 30 – 400 MHz   | 400 – 2000 MHz   | 2 – 300 GHz   |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| General Public         | 2 W/m2         | f/200 W/m2(1)    | 10 W/m2       |
| Occupational (workers) | 10 W/m2        | f/40 W/m2(1)     | 50 W/m2       |

(1)  f

= frequency in MHz

The reference levels, which vary according to frequency, have been

chosen so that compliance with the reference levels ensures compliance

with the basic restrictions. This means that additional safety margins

have been introduced. If the measured or calculated RF EMF value exceeds

the reference level, it does not necessarily follow that the basic

restriction will be exceeded.

For exposure periods shorter than the averaging time, exposure

levels higher than the basic restrictions or reference levels are

accepted provided the average is lower than the limits.

In the case of RF sources with multiple frequencies, the following

requirement is specified in the ICNIRP guidelines for the whole-body

reference levels. In case of transmission in n different frequency

bands, where Si is the power density at the ith frequency and Slim,i is the reference level for that

frequency, the requirement for total exposure is as follows:

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

# 3 RF EMF Exposure Assessments

A compliance distance is the minimum separation distance to be

kept between an antenna and a person to ensure that the relevant RF

EMF exposure limits are not exceeded. Compliance distances generally

vary in different directions from the antenna. In practice, the compliance

distance in all directions, called the compliance boundary, is described

in terms of a simple geometrical object (volumetric structure) enclosing

the transmitting antenna.

To install a radio or an antenna correctly, it is important to

know the RF EMF exposure compliance boundary to ensure that RF exposure

levels are below specified limits in areas accessible to the general

public.

Ericsson has performed RF EMF exposure assessments in accordance

with international and national standards and regulations in order

to determine compliance boundaries for typical configurations of the

radio products. The resulting compliance boundary dimensions are included

in the respective Radio Description.

The EMF compliance boundary assessments are made for the maximum

output power of the radio product, that is for the nominal maximum

power with the specified power (or EIRP) tolerance and transmission

losses included, and in some cases also for other configurable power

(or EIRP) level. For TDD products the maximum downlink to uplink transmission

ratio is considered to obtain the maximum time-averaged power delivered

to the antenna. In case of products with beamforming capabilities

(massive MIMO), actual maximum exposure conditions are taken into

account, as described in IEC 62232 and IEC TR 62669. With beam scanning

in azimuth and elevation, the directions of RF EMF exposure vary in

time which means that the actual time-averaged RF EMF exposure is

significantly lower than the instantaneous maximum. To consider this

effect, a Power Reduction Factor (PRF) is used to calculate the actual

exposure and the corresponding compliance boundaries. When relevant,

also the difference in gain between the control-channel and the traffic-channel

transmission is considered when determining the compliance boundaries

of massive MIMO products.

A factor that is not taken into account when determining the compliance

boundaries is the power utilization, which in most real cases is well

below 100% and will significantly reduce the actual time-averaged

power and the RF exposure.

The intended installation of the radio equipment is specified in

the product documentation. Other installations and related exposure

conditions are not reasonably foreseeable for the equipment and thus

not considered in the RF EMF exposure assessments conducted by Ericsson.

For product configurations and antennas other than those specified

by Ericsson, or for situations where the radio product is planned

to be put into operation near other radio sources and antennas, it

is necessary to estimate the maximum cumulative RF EMF exposure levels

and the resulting compliance distances to determine the requirements

for a base station site.

Methods are presented below that can be used to estimate RF EMF

exposure levels and the dimensions of the compliance boundaries. These

and other calculation and measurement methods are described in standards

and technical reports such as IEC 62232, IEC TR 62669, IEEE C95.3,

ITU-T K.52, ITU-T K.61, and ITU-T K.100.

It should be noted that the compliance boundaries provided by Ericsson

have been either calculated or measured using methods and procedures

designed to produce as accurate results as possible. Other estimation

methods provided in the above-mentioned standards may therefore result

in more conservative (larger) compliance distances. Furthermore, the

RF EMF exposure information provided by Ericsson for hybrid and interleaved

antenna integrated radio products is only valid for the active part

since it is a decision of the customer how to use the passive antenna.

Appendix A provides an example of how the RF EMF compliance boundaries

change when classic macro radios are connected to the passive antenna

of an interleaved massive MIMO radio product.

## 3.1 Analytical
RF EMF Exposure Calculations

The far-field formula below may be used to estimate

the free-space far-field power density S (W/m2) in the

main direction of an antenna:

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

P (W) is the total maximum RMS (root mean square) power fed to

the antenna, that is, the sum of all transmitter channels minus transmission

losses. The maximum power may be taken as either the theoretical or

actual maximum power depending on what is known at the time of assessment

and depending on applicable regulatory requirements. G is the linear

antenna gain relative to an isotropic radiator, and d (m) is the distance

from the antenna. PG is the Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)

of the antenna, expressed in watts.

The far field region is commonly considered to start at a distance

2D2/&amp;lgr; from the antenna, where D is the largest dimension

of the antenna and &amp;lgr; the wavelength in meters.

If needed, electric (E in V/m) and magnetic (H in A/m) field strengths

are calculated using the equation S = E2/377 = 377H2, where 377 (Ω) is the impedance of free space.

The near-field formula below is derived from the so-called

cylinder formula, which is used to estimate the average power density

closer to the antenna. The near-field formula estimates the maximum

power density in the near-field region of colinear array antennas.

For an antenna with an azimuthal half-power beam width of 3dB degrees, an aperture height of h meters, and a total RMS

power feed of P watts, the power density in the main beam direction

at a distance of d meters from the antenna is as follows:

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

The far-field formula (2) gives relatively accurate estimations

(within ± 3 dB) of the far-field power density in free space

without significant reflecting surfaces near the position of exposure

prediction. If used in the near-field region, it overestimates the

exposure. Similarly, the near-field formula (3) overestimates exposure

levels in the far-field region. An accurate estimation of the real

exposure is obtained by using both formulas and applying the lowest

value.

For radio equipment employing massive MIMO and beamforming, the

far-field formula (2) together with available antenna pattern files

specifying the envelope of the traffic beams (gain values) can be

used to determine the maximum power density in different directions.

Alternatively, the maximum power density for the traffic beam when

scanned towards the direction (&amp;thgr;,) may be estimated using

the far-field formula in (2) with a scan-dependent antenna gain

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

where Gmax is the maximum antenna gain for an array

scanned to broadside, and FSL is a scan-dependent loss

factor incorporating effects of impedance mismatch, reduced aperture

area and a non-isotropic element pattern. For an ideal antenna aperture

and a beam scanning an angle α from broadside, the scan loss

may be taken as

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

For RF EMF exposure determination in other directions, that is,

above, below, behind, and at the sides of the antenna, it can be difficult

to use analytical expressions, since the near-field radiation properties

are usually unknown. Other methods are preferred instead, such as

those described in IEC 62232 and other standards.

## 3.2 Theoretical and Actual Maximum
Transmitted Power

RF exposure assessments may be conducted for either theoretical

maximum or actual maximum power configurations as specified and described

in IEC 62232 and IEC TR 62669. The theoretical maximum power corresponds

to the nominal maximum transmitted power including effects of deterministic

factors such as technology duty cycle plus the specified power tolerance.

The applicability of actual maximum power is a regulatory question.

If the time-averaged power distribution is known from measurements

on an operational base station, the maximum time-averaged transmitted

power can be used as the actual maximum transmitted power. When the

time-averaged power distribution is unknown, statistical simulation

or measurement results of base station sites with similar configurations

and environments can be used to determine the actual maximum transmitted

power. By generating Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of the

transmitted power, the actual maximum transmitted power for a new

cell with unknown power distribution may be taken as the 95th percentile value. For radio products employing massive MIMO and

beamforming, similar CDFs may be generated which also considers effects

of scheduling time and spatial distribution of served users, see IEC

62232 and IEC TR 62669. Ericsson features are available for monitoring

and control of the time-averaged power to ensure that the actual maximum

power used to determine the maximum RF EMF exposure and compliance

boundary is not exceeded. Counters are also available to log the time-averaged

power levels.

## 3.3 Determining
Compliance Distances

Compliance boundary information for typical configurations and

recommended antennas is provided by Ericsson as part of the Radio

Description for each specific product. For configurations and antennas

other than those specified by Ericsson, it is necessary to estimate

RF exposure levels and specify the requirements for a base station

site.

The analytical RF EMF exposure assessment methods described above

may be used to determine compliance distances for both general public

and occupational exposure. In far-field environments without significant

reflections, the analytical far-field formula (2) can be used. With

S = Slim, which is the reference level expressed as power

density (W/m2), the compliance distance dcompliance (m) in the main beam direction is calculated as follows:

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

For near-field situations, a more accurate estimation of compliance

distance within the main beam of the antenna is given by the near-field

formula as:

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

A compliance boundary is formed by the compliance distances in

all directions and it is normally described in terms of a simple geometrical

object.

For radio products employing massive MIMO and beamforming, the

compliance boundary dimensions may be determined from the envelope

of all possible traffic beams with the compliance distance in each

individual direction (&amp;thgr;,) assessed using (6). If a significant

proportion of the transmitted power is used for broadcast beams with

lower antenna gain the total RF exposure may be assessed using the

combined exposure according to (1).

![Image](../images/12446-EN_LZT7200399Uen.J/additional_3_CP.png)

It is recommended always to round the calculated compliance boundary

dimensions upwards.

It should be noted that the compliance boundaries provided by Ericsson

can have been calculated or measured using more complex and accurate

methods. These compliance boundaries will therefore generally be smaller

than those given by the estimation formulas used above.

# 4 Compliance Boundary Structures

A compliance distance is the minimum separation distance to be

kept between an antenna and a person to ensure that the relevant RF

EMF exposure limits are not exceeded. Compliance distances generally

vary in different directions from the antenna. In practice, the compliance

distance in all directions, called the compliance boundary, is described

in terms of a simple geometrical object (volumetric structure) enclosing

the transmitting antenna.

Various objects such as cylinders, boxes, or truncated boxes surrounding

the antenna/equipment may be used, see IEC 62232. The dimensions of

the volumetric structure are chosen to obtain the tightest fit with

the obtained compliance distances in all directions. Depending on

the chosen compliance boundary type and the antenna design, the level

of conservativeness may vary.

For configurations employing sector coverage antennas, the antenna

or radio equipment is not located at the center of the compliance

boundary. Instead it is located almost at the edge, facing towards

the center of the cylinder/box. Figures illustrating the employed

compliance boundary structures used by Ericsson for different radio

products and configurations are provided in the subsections below.

## 4.1 Macro Products

For macro products, both cylindrical and box-shaped compliance

boundaries are used as illustrated in  Figure 1 and  Figure 2. Cylindrical compliance boundaries are

normally used for radio product configurations with external antennas.

Box-shaped compliance boundaries are used for AIR (antenna integrated

system) and multicolumn MIMO configurations as illustrated in  Figure 2.

The distance between the back of the antenna/equipment and the

cylinder/box is the "Distance behind antenna/equipment". For a box-shaped

compliance boundary the front and back compliance distances are defined

from the equipment/antenna casing as shown in  Figure 2. The "Height" of the cylinder/box

is the antenna height plus a certain, equal distance above and below

the antenna/equipment. For mmW NR AIR products the center of the height

of the box is at the center of the antenna unit. For a box-shaped

compliance boundary the 'Width' represents the width of

the box.

To avoid that the box-shaped compliance boundary gives overly conservative

dimensions, it can be truncated according to IEC 62232. Appendix B

provides an example of a truncated compliance boundary for an AIR

product.

Figure 2   Box-shaped Compliance Boundaries for Multicolumn MIMO Configurations

(left), and AIR Configurations (right).

## 4.2 Micro Products

For micro products, box-shaped compliance boundaries are used.

For configurations with internal antennas or external sector coverage

antennas, the front and back compliance distances are defined from

the equipment/antenna casing as shown in  Figure 3. For configurations with external omni-directional antennas, the

compliance boundary dimensions are defined with respect to the origin

centered between the dipole antenna elements, see  Figure 4.

According to requirements in USA and Canada some micro products

may be classified as 'mobile devices' with

an intended separation distance to the user or nearby persons of at

least 20 cm. For micro products with a low nominal output power setting,

EMF compliance tests can confirm that the exposure levels are below

the exposure limits at 20 cm separation distance for internal and/or

external antenna configurations. In this case no compliance boundary

is defined.

internal antennas and for configurations with external sector coverage

antennas. The front and back compliance distances are defined from

the EUT/antenna casing.

Figure 4   Box-shaped Compliance Boundary used for configurations with

external omni-directional antennas. The compliance boundary dimensions

are defined with respect to the origin centered between the dipole

antenna elements.

## 4.3 Pico Products

For EU and markets other than USA and Canada, box-shaped compliance

boundaries are determined for pico products with the front and back

compliance distances defined from the equipment casing as shown in  Figure 5. The widths and heights are specified

including the dimensions of the product.

For ceiling mounted external antennas, cylinder-shaped compliance

boundaries are determined with the front, back and radial compliance

distances defined relative to the equipment casing as shown in  Figure 6.

As for low-power micro products, a pico product may be classified

as a 'mobile device' with an intended separation

distance to the user or nearby persons of at least 20 cm, according

to requirements in USA and Canada. EMF compliance tests can confirm

that the exposure levels are below the exposure limits at 20 cm separation

distance for the internal and external antennas used individually

or combined. In this case no compliance boundary is defined.

distances are defined from the equipment casing.

Figure 6   Cylinder-shaped Compliance Boundary. The compliance distances

are defined relative to the equipment casing.

## 4.4 Radio Dots

For EU and countries other than USA and Canada, cylinder-shaped

compliance boundaries are defined for Radio Dot products, with the

front, back and radial compliance distances relative to the equipment

casing as shown in  Figure 7. Since the back

distance is normally zero, often only the radial and front distances

are defined.

A compliance distance of zero in all directions means that the

radio product is compliant at the surface, also called touch compliant.

are defined relative to the equipment casing.

# 5 Radio Product Installation Guidelines

The radio product or its antennas shall be installed to make sure

that the general public does not have access to the applicable RF

EMF compliance boundary. The compliance boundary dimensions provided

in the Radio Description documents were determined for the product

transmitting in free space. To consider possible contributions from

ambient sources (for example, other radio transmitters already present

on site) or the influence from any reflecting or scattering objects

in the vicinity of the antenna, the product installation assessment

procedures provided in IEC 62232 can be used. The EU requirements

in EN 504 01 also apply, and other applicable national or regional

regulations need to be considered.

## 5.1 Guidelines for Work near a Radio Product

During installation, maintenance or repair of a radio product,

no work shall be carried out within the specified compliance boundary

for workers.

For many products with internal or external directive antennas,

the extension of the compliance boundary in the back direction is

zero or very small. In these cases, it is possible to work behind

the radio or antenna without any restrictions related to RF EMF exposure

if the product is installed so that contributions from other ambient

sources (for example, other radio transmitters) are not significant

and may be neglected.

If work needs to be performed within the compliance boundary applicable

for workers, the radio equipment shall be powered off, or the power

be reduced to a level ensuring that the RF EMF exposure is below the

relevant exposure limit for workers.

If work is conducted on behalf of Ericsson, minimum requirements

related to RF EMF exposure are provided in LME-12:001904 Uen.

## 5.2 General Public Safety Recommendations

The following recommendations supplement any existing Ericsson-recommended

technical or scientific guidelines:

- If compliance boundary or other necessary RF EMF exposure information is not available, estimate the maximum exposure using the methods described in this document or in relevant standards, and consider alternative locations or configurations for the radio/antenna installation if the results do not comply with the applicable exposure limits for the general public in accessible areas around the site.
- If non-authorized people have access to the region in front of the antenna, raise the installation height on roofs or walls to a sufficient height considering the transmitted power, the applicable down-tilt angle, and the compliance boundary. Optionally, consider placing directional antennas near the rooftop edge pointing away from the building.
- If antennas cannot be raised to a sufficient height, restrict access for non-authorized people and consider using signs posted at rooftop entrances or on radio/antenna equipment.
- Mount antennas on building facades so that they are inaccessible from windows and balconies.
- Avoid installing indoor radio products or antennas where they can be easily reached.
- Respond to health and safety concerns by providing relevant information that answers questions regarding RF EMF exposure received from local authorities or people living or working near installations.

# 7 Appendix A: Example of Compliance Boundaries
for an Interleaved AIR Product

This section provides information on how the resulting RF EMF compliance

boundary may change for interleaved antenna integrated radio products

when the passive antenna module is used and connected to remote radio

unit. The radio selected as an example is the Interleaved AIR 3218

B78V 2LB4HBp, which is an AAS product with an integrated passive antenna

module in front of the active antenna. In the radio description for

this product RF EMF compliance information only for the active antenna

module is included.

It is the end user of the product who decides how the passive antenna

module will be used. This informative example assumes that a Radio

4466 (B1 B3 B7) and a Radio 2460 (B8 B20 B28B) are connected to the

ports of the passive antenna module.  Table 3 shows the data used as input to the RF EMF evaluation.

The RF EMF compliance boundary assessment was conducted using the

far-field formula (2) and available antenna pattern (gain) data for

the active and passive antennas. The applicable ICNIRP reference levels

were used, and contributions from the different frequency bands and

antenna modules were considered using equation (1). For bands associated

to radios with four transmitters, an additional 3 dB was included

to consider coherent field summation for co-polarized antennas in

every point.

Figure 8   Truncated box-shaped compliance boundary. (Left: horizontal

plane. Right: vertical plane.)

In addition to above parameters, truncation is applied to the box

by using three additional parameters as described in  Figure 8. In the horizontal

plane, the box is truncated with a 45° cut plane on the edges

near the AIR product, described by De,w, while in the

vertical plane the box shape is truncated with an additional box below

the AIR product, described by De,d and De,f,d:

| De,w   | Width at the back plane of AIR product truncated by 45° cut planes.   |    |
