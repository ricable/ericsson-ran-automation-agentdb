# 2 Remedy Action for RfPort: ReturnLoss &lt;returnLoss&gt; dB, VSWR &lt;vswr&gt;, Sensitivity &lt;sensitivity&gt;%.

The alarm is raised with this additional text for single-band radio units when the DC

resistance on the branch dramatically increases or decreases resulting from any of the

following problems:

- Short circuit problems
- Open circuit problems
- Problems on Antenna System devices

The

Antenna

Return Loss Frequency Sweep function measures return loss and provides information on

probable cause of alarm. See Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep and

Interpretation of Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep Measurement in Manage Hardware Equipment.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Generate artificial load using the Air Interface Load Generator feature or the NR Air Interface Load Generator feature. If the PM counters show normal data after switching on the load generator, the VSWR alarm was raised because of low traffic. If the problem remains, the problem is with the antenna equipment.
3. Check that the RfPort.vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute is correctly configured. Too high RfPort.vswrSupervisionSensitivity value might cause false alarms. Recommended threshold values can be calculated using the VSWR Alarm Threshold Calculator for Non-GSM Nodes.
4. Check that the RfBranch.dlAttenuation attribute is correctly configured. If the configuration is changed, restart the digital unit as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.
5. Check that the RfBranch.ulAttenuation attribute is correctly configured. If the configuration is changed, restart the digital unit as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Check if the antenna that is connected to the RF Port is in SIMO configuration.
7. In the case of SIMO configuration, lock the unused RfPort MO instance. In the case of SIMO configuration the value of the noOfTxAntennas attribute or the noOfRxAntennas attribute is set to 1.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Restart the radio unit, as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.
9. Check if the alarm has ceased. Note: It might take up to 30 minutes for the alarm to be raised again.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

10. Send a technician to site.
11. Check that the feeder cable is connected properly to the antenna and to the radio unit, and that the feeder and antenna system does not have short circuit. Note: Ensure that the feeder cable has no signal before disconnecting it. The radios must be locked.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

12. Check that the feeder does not contain water and the antenna is not covered in snow.
13. Check that no excessive RF signal comes from an external source. Note: The Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep function provides information on external interference sources. The combination of high and stable return loss values and one carrier with a very low value indicates the coexistence of the following conditions: A strong external continuous wave interference source is present. The antenna system works well.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

14. Replace the faulty antenna equipment. See Replacing Antenna Unit in Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

15. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for RfPort: ReturnLoss &lt;returnLoss&gt; dB, VSWR &lt;vswr&gt;, Sensitivity &lt;sensitivity&gt;%, Fault on DL Frequency Range &lt;dlFrequencyRanges&gt; kHz.

The alarm is raised with this additional text for multiband radio units when the DC

resistance on the branch dramatically increases or decreases resulting from any of

the following problems:

- Short circuit problems
- Open circuit problems
- Problems on Antenna System devices

The

Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep function measures

return

and provides information on probable cause of alarm. See Antenna Return Loss

Frequency Sweep and Interpretation of Antenna Return Loss Frequency

2. Generate artificial load using the Air Interface Load Generator feature or the NR Air Interface Load Generator feature. If the PM counters show normal data after switching on the load generator, the VSWR alarm was raised because of low traffic. If the problem remains, the problem is with the antenna equipment.
3. Check that the FreqBandData.vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute is correctly configured. Too high FreqBandData.vswrSupervisionSensitivity value might cause false alarms. Recommended threshold values can be calculated using the VSWR Alarm Threshold Calculator for Non-GSM Nodes.
4. Check that the RfBranch.dlAttenuationPerFqRange attribute for the specific band shown in RfBranch.bandListis correctly configured. If the configuration is changed, restart the digital unit as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.
5. Check that the RfBranch.ulAttenuationPerFqRange attribute for the specific band shown in RfBranch.bandList is correctly configured. If the configuration is changed, restart the digital unit as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Restart the radio unit, as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.
7. Check if the alarm has ceased. It might take up to 30 minutes for the alarm to be raised again.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

10. Check that the feeder does not contain water and the antenna is not covered in snow.
11. Check that no excessive RF signal comes from an external source. Note: The Antenna Return Loss Frequency Sweep function provides information on external interference sources. The function is supported on radios with VSWR Antenna Supervision capability. The combination of high and stable return loss values and one carrier with a very low value indicates the coexistence of the following conditions: A strong external continuous wave interference source is present. The antenna system works well.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

12. Replace the faulty antenna equipment. See Replacing Antenna Unit in Manage Hardware Equipment.
