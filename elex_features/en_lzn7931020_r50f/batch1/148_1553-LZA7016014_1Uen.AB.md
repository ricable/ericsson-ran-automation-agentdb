# 1 Radio Access Migration Overview

Radio access migration is the end-to-end process of migrating LTE and NR Radio Access

Technology from a source node to a target node. The process includes the immediate

preparation required before starting off-site and on-site activities.

Image Radio Access Migration

Process shows a high-level overview of the operational process:

The radio access migration workflow is divided into the following phases:

| Early preparation   |    | The migration is planned, and necessary network, hardware, and license                             configurations are prepared for the source and target nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Preparation         |    | ENM Auto Provisioning (AP) project templates are created, and scripts are                             used to fetch radio access and transport network configurations for the                             source and target node. In addition, feature deactivation and activation                             are                             handled,                             as well as health check and backup creation. |
|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Execution           |    | The ENM AP project templates are imported and configurations are applied                             to source and target nodes by using the                                 Baseband                                 Maintenance button on-site or the ap                                 resume command.                                                                                                                       |

The following MO branches are migrated for the respective Radio Access Technology:

Table 1   Migrated MO Branches

| LTE                | NR                 |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| ENodeBFunction     | GNBCUCPFunction    |
| MceFunction        | GNBCUUPFunction    |
| Equipment(1)       | GNBDUFunction      |
| NodeSupport(2)     | Equipment(1)       |

| Transport(4)       | SystemFunctions(3) |
|                    | Transport(4)       |

(1)Only equipment related to the migrated Radio Access Technology is migrated

to the target node, such as radios and R503s. No configuration related to cabinet

controller or support system is migrated, this must be handled outside of the migration.

For exampleï¼Œfor information on configurations of a Controller 6610, see relevant

documents in the Controller 6610 library. For information on migrating the cabinet or

support system to a Controller 6610, see Migrate Baseband Unit Using NETCONF-Based Procedure.

(2)Only the SectorEquipmentFunction MO is migrated.

(3)Only licensed feature activations are migrated.

(4)Only SCTP end-points and profiles are migrated. Synchronize configuration

is not migrated. Transport configuration related to the migrated RAT is kept as is at

the source node. Such configuration needs to be removed manually, if required. If the

transport MOs are shared between RATs at the source node, it cannot be deleted.

## 1.1 Radio Access Migration Requirements

### 1.1.1 Radio Access Migration Limitations

Radio access migration is not supported for some hardware units and in certain

configurations. In some cases, the introduction of additional hardware equipment is

necessary for the migration.

Limitations

- Only the LTE and NR radio access technologies are supported for migration. The radio access technology must always be migrated as a whole.
- Migration is only supported for RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 if the radio access technology is supported by the hardware type and the hardware capacity is fulfilled. The following migration cases are supported for these groups: In any direction for units in the same RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 4 to RAN Compute group 4. To a later RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 3 to RAN Compute groups 4, 5 and 6. For more information about RAN Compute groups and supported hardware types, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.
- Migration is not supported for the following units and configurations: 3PP radio units Indoor radio units, such as IRUs and RDs Cloud RAN deployments MORAN and MOCN configurations for LTE Switched Fronthaul configurations Mixed Mode Radios with radio access technologies other than LTE and NR at the source node Single or Mixed Mode Radios shared between source node and another node Configurations with cascaded radio units. For more information about hardware configurations, see Manage Hardware Equipment. PIM cancellation configurations ULComp configurations Elastic RAN (E-RAN) configurations for LTE ARC configurations for NR LTE RAN with carrier aggregation configuration between nodes using Elastic RAN NR RAN with carrier aggregation configuration between nodes using ARC
- Migration cannot be done if the migrated radio access technology shares the AntennaUnitGroup MO class with another radio access technology.
- Migration cannot be done if the radio access technology to be migrated shares a radio unit with another unmigrated radio access technology.
- LTE-specific configuration data that is not visible in the source node MOM is not migrated.
- Lightweight neighbor cell relations for NR are not migrated.
- System constants for the migrated radio access technology are not copied and must be applied again after completed migration.
- Radio access migration cannot be done unless equipment related to the migration, for example radio units, is supported by the target node. Any changes in equipment that are needed to meet project specifications must be done as a separate activity before the radio access migration. For more information about supported equipment configurations, see the following documents: Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity Supported Radio Capabilities
- Radio access migration cannot be done for cabinet and enclosure control functions that use EC Bus. This must be done as a separate activity before the radio access migration by introducing, for example a Controller 6610 unit. For more information, see Migrating the Cabinet or Support System Related Configuration to a Controller 6610 unit in Migrate Baseband Unit Using NETCONF-Based Procedure.
- When migrating from RAN Compute group 1 or 3 to RAN Compute group 4, 5 and 6, only features that are supported in RAN Compute group 1 or 3 are configured and activated at migration. Features that are only supported in RAN Compute group 4, 5 and 6 must be configured and activated manually as a post-migration activity.

### 1.1.2 Radio Access Migration Prerequisites

Before radio access migration, prerequisites regarding node configuration, location

of source and target node, and available personnel must be met.

The following prerequisites must be fulfilled:

- Source and target nodes are at the same site with the same software level.
- The radio access technology to be migrated does not exist on the target node, as the whole ENB and GNB is migrated from the source node.
- The radio access technology is migrated as a whole. This means that all sectors and cells, and related frequency bands are moved from the source node to the target node.
- A transport network is configured on the target node before the migration, which includes the following: Transport network ports Interfaces Addresses Routers For an example transport network configuration, see Example Configuration for Transport Network Using a NETCONF File. The configuration can be added through the following options: ENM CLI AMOS ENM AP expansion project As part of an ENM AP integration project in case the target node is factory reset. For information on how to configure a factory reset node for migration, see Configure a New Baseband Unit for Radio Access Migration. For more information about transport network configurations, see Manage Transport Network and Manage IPsec.
- The availability and usage of free RI-ports at the target node is checked and approved according to project specifications. In addition, the placement of the baseband radio nodes on site makes it possible to disconnect the cabling for the impacted RI links from the source node and connect them to the target node.
- An off-site engineer and on-site technician is available to perform the migration.
- Information about user-defined PM subscriptions on the source node is saved in order to be activated on the target node after completed migration.

### 1.1.3 Software Requirements

Radio access migration requires the software to be up to date and the browser and

Operating System requirements to be met.

Supported Upgrade Package for RAN Compute Units

For a detailed list of RAN Compute Units and their supported Upgrade Package, see

Manage Software.

# 2 Early Preparation

During the early preparation phase, necessary network, equipment, and license

configurations are prepared for source and target nodes.

Image Early Preparation Phase

Steps shows the operational process of the early preparation phase:

## 2.1 User Account Preparation

ENM and node accounts with the correct user roles must be prepared to guarantee

proper access rights to ENM and the involved radio nodes when performing the radio access

migration.

For more information on user account creation, see Role Management in the ENM Online Help

library in ELEX.

Consider the security risks when handling the migration user account, as the migration

user requires access to the full node configuration and possibly to several radio nodes.

It is recommended to use Target Based Access Control (TBAC) as an addition to Role-Based

Access Control (RBAC), and remove the user when migration is completed.

For more information about access management, see the ENM Identity and Access

Management System Administrator Guide in the Ericsson Network Manager CPI

library.

### 2.1.1 Configure ENM Account

Steps

1. Create an ENM account with the following user roles: Autoprovisioning\_Operator or Autoprovisioning\_Administrator Shm\_Administrator NHC\_Administrator AMOS\_operator Cell\_Management\_Administrator

### 2.1.2 Configure Node Account

Steps

1. Create a node account with the following COM roles: SystemReadOnly ENodeB\_Application\_Administrator GNodeB\_Application\_Administrator NodeB\_Application\_Administrator Bts\_Application\_Administrator

## 2.2 Download Radio Access Migration Scripts

The migration scripts for the proper quarterly release must be downloaded and added

to the AMOS scripting environment in ENM.

Prerequisites

- The software level of the migration script must be the same as the software level used in the Baseband units. The version of the migration script to use is indicated in the excel file containing the migration script. For more information about software levels, see RAN Release note.

Steps

1. Download the Migrate Radio Access Script excel file from the applicable RAN CPI library in ELEX.
2. Fetch the migration script ZIP file from the excel file.
3. Extract the migration script ZIP file to a directory which AMOS has access to.

## 2.3 License and Feature Preparation

Updated LKFs must be imported into ENM and uploaded to the source and target nodes

during the execution phase. This is to ensure that required licenses are activated on the

target node, and unneeded licenses are deactivated on the source node after completed

migration.

Target Node Licensing

The LKF update is done automatically if Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode is

used.

If Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode is used, Integration Unlock or System Trigger Unlock automatically

grants license resources after completed migration. An updated LKF must be manually

obtained and installed as part of this migration flow during the Finalize Radio

Access Migration phase.

If the manual licensing method is used, an updated LKF must be ordered and prepared

for the target node in advance. For manual licensing instructions, see License Request and Delivery with Manual Licensing.

Target Node Feature Activation

It is necessary to check which features must be added and activated at the target

node after the migration. Added features for the target node are automatically

activated according to the updated LKF through the migration feature activation

script.

For guidance on which features that must be added and activated on the target node

for LTE RAN, see LTE RAN Parameter Recommendations List. For NR RAN, see

NR RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists. The content of

these documents can be compared to the features activated in the source node at the

time of migration.

When migrating from RAN Compute group 1 or 3 to

RAN

Compute group

4,

5 and

6,

only features that are supported in

RAN

Compute group 1 or 3 are activated at migration. Features that are only supported in

RAN

Compute group

4,

5 and

6

must be

configured and

activated manually as a post-migration activity.

Source Node Licensing

If the source node is decommissioned after completed migration, no preparation of

updated LKF is required. However, Ericsson support must be informed that the node is

decommissioned to remove the fingerprint from ELIS.

If the source node is kept, Ericsson support must be contacted to return the unused

licenses from the source node. This applies for all licensing methods.

Source Node Feature Deactivation

If the source node is kept, features that are specific for the migrated access radio

must be deactivated through the migration script.

Additional Information

Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes

## 2.4 Health Check Strategy

It is recommended to select the health check method to be used before and after the

radio access migration.

Depending on the selected method, necessary access rights, profiles and categories must

be created and made available for the on-site technician and the off-site engineer. The

following health check methods are recommended for radio access migration cases:

Manual Node Health Check (NHC)

A manual health check for source and target nodes using a suitable NHC profile. This

health check method can be used at any time before and after the migration to

determine the health status of the involved nodes. Different HC profiles are needed

before and after the migration for the source and target node. The following NHC

categories are recommended:

- Before migration, the SITE\_ACCEPTANCE health check category for the source and target node.
- After migration, the SITE\_ACCEPTANCE health check category for the target node. This category checks the migrated S1 and X2 interfaces, cells, and the related equipment, as well as traffic checks.

For more information on how to configure a manual health check, see Manage Node Health Check and ENM Online Help in

ELEX.

Automated Health Check (AHC)

AHC provides health checks and diagnostics using ENM Flow Automation. This health

check method can be used at any time before and after the migration to determine the

health status of the involved nodes.

For more information on how to configure a health check using AHC, see Manage Automated Health Check.

Node Health Validator (NHV)

NHV in EMGUI provides node health status and health validation using LMT port or ENM.

This health check method can be used at any time before and after the migration to

determine the health status of the involved nodes.

For more information on how to configure a health check using NHV, see EMGUI Node Health Validator.

# 3 Preparation

During the preparation phase, ENM AP projects are created and scripts are used to

fetch radio access and transport network configurations for the source and target node. In

addition, feature deactivation and activation are prepared, as well as health check and

backup creation.

Image Preparation Phase Steps

shows the operational process of the preparation phase.

## 3.1 Perform Source and Target Node Health Checks

The manual health checks decided in the early preparation phase are performed to

verify the health status of the nodes.

This task is optional.

Prerequisites

Depending on the decided health check method, necessary accounts, profiles and

categories are created and available for the on-site technician and the off-site

engineer.

Steps

1. Run a health check on the source node.
2. Resolve any issues found in the health check logs.
3. Run a health check on the target node.
4. Resolve any issues found in the health check logs.

## 3.2 Source and Target Node Backups

This task is optional.

It is recommended to create manual backups of the source and target

nodes during the preparation phase. Automatic backups are created during the execution

phase as part of the ENM AP flow, in case the migration fails or is canceled. However,

manual backups can be used for rollback at a later phase if needed.

For instructions on creating backups, see Create Backup Manually in Manage Software.

## 3.3 Run Source Node Script

A dedicated migration script is run in AMOS towards the source node to create a

project template of the existing radio access configuration.

One project

template is created for the target node which is later used to add the radio access

configuration to this node.

For LTE, all cell relations (including dynamic and ANR-created relations) are copied

during migration, whereas for NR only the manually configured cell relations are

copied. The migrated LTE cell relations can be updated later by the ANR function in

the target node.

The script also creates a project template for the deletion of the radio access

configuration on the source node.

Prerequisites

- Migration scripts are downloaded from the RAN CPI library in ELEX and are available in the AMOS scripting environment in ENM. If changes are made to the configuration, the migration script must be rerun to obtain the new project templates.

Steps

1. Open the folder to which the radio access migration script ZIP file was extracted in Download Radio Access Migration Scripts.
2. Open the Access\_Migration\_Options.xml file.
3. Set one of the following values for &lt;RadioAccessToMigrate&gt; to specify which radio access type(s) should be migrated: LTE NR LTE+NR
4. Save and close the file.
5. Open the AMOS CLI.
6. Execute the following command towards the source node: &gt;run /path/to/Access\_migration.mos /path/to/Access\_Migration.xsl where /path/to is the directory where the migration script files are stored. Output files from the migration script are created and stored in the following location: /ericsson/log/amos/moshell\_logfiles/&lt;username&gt;/logs\_moshell/Access\_Migration/source\_node /ericsson/log/amos/moshell\_logfiles/&lt;username&gt;/logs\_moshell/Access\_Migration/target\_node
![Image](../images/148_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AB/additional_3_CP.png)
![Image](../images/148_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AB/additional_3_CP.png)

The target\_node directory contains the following

folders:

```
/Template Files
/Validation Files
```

7. Create a ZIP file for the target node with the Template Files and Validation Files folders. Example:cd /path/to/Access\_Migration/target\_node zip -r file.zip Template\ Files/ Validation\ Files/ Note: It is important that the Template Files and Validation Files folders are placed at the top level of the migration project ZIP file.
![Image](../images/148_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AB/additional_3_CP.png)

The source\_node directory contains the following files and

folder:

```
ProjectInfo.xml
/<NodeName>
    NodeInfo.xml
    RemoveRat.xml
```

8. Create a ZIP file for the source node with the ProjectInfo.xml file and the &lt;NodeName&gt; folder. Example:cd /path/to/Access\_Migration/source\_node zip -r file.zip &lt;NodeName&gt;/ ProjectInfo.xml Note: It is important that the &lt;NodeName&gt; folder is placed at the top level of the migration project ZIP file.
![Image](../images/148_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AB/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The &lt;target\_node&gt; ZIP file contains a project template for

adding the migrated radio access technology to the target node. This file is further

updated through ECT to include the target node-specific adaptations in the ECT CIQ

file.

The &lt;source\_node&gt; ZIP file contains a project template for

deleting the migrated radio access technology from the source node.

## 3.4 Configuration of Transport Network on Target Node

Transport network configurations for the migrated radio access technology must be

completed on the target node before executing the migration.

When configuring a transport network on a target node, the following assumptions

apply:

- The target node is in operation, which means that a transport configuration for OAM exists. If the target node is factory reset, additional configurations must be done. For more information on configuring a factory reset Baseband unit, see Configure a New Baseband Unit for Radio Access Migration.
- The existing transport network configuration on the target node must be updated to accommodate the transport requirements, such as backhaul capacity, bandwidth, or routing setups for the migrated radio access technology.
- Synchronization is already configured on the target node.
- If SctpEndpoint MO parameters dtlsNodeCredential and dtlsTrustCategory exist on the source node, appropriate NodeCredential and TrustCategory MOs must be prepared in advance on the target node during the transport network configuration step. For more information, see table MO Reference Mapping in Managed Object and Parameter Examples.
- If ENodeBFunction MO parameter dnsSelectionS1X2 exists on the source node, appropriate DNS configuration for S1 and X2 lookups must be prepared in advance on the target node during the transport network configuration step. For more information, see table MO Reference Mapping in Managed Object and Parameter Examples.
- If LocalDnsEndpoint MO parameter dnsClientRef is used in GNBCUCPFunction on the source node, appropriate DNS configuration must be prepared in advance on the target node during the transport network configuration step.

For a transport network configuration example, see Example Configuration for Transport Network Using a NETCONF

File.

For more information about transport network setups in a trusted network, see Manage Transport Network.

For more information about transport network setups in an untrusted network, see Manage IPsec.

## 3.5 Run Target Node Script

A dedicated migration script is run in AMOS towards the target node.

The target node script is used to retrieve the configuration from target node prior

to migration. The migrated configuration is later validated against this target node

file to ensure that the CIQ mapping is correct.

Prerequisites

- Migration scripts are downloaded from the RAN CPI library in ELEX and are available in the AMOS scripting environment in ENM.
- The target node is updated with new transport configuration according to instructions in Configuration of Transport Network on Target Node.

Steps

1. Open the AMOS CLI.
2. Execute the following command towards the target node to obtain the configuration data that is present before migration: &gt;run /path/to/Get\_target\_config.mos/path/to/Access\_Migration\_get\_target\_config.xsl
![Image](../images/148_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.AB/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The target-preconfig.xml file is created. This file is used as a

Pre-configuration

file in ECT when the &lt;target\_node&gt; ZIP file is validated

and substituted. The target node CIQ file must be further updated using the ECT

Configuration Files Handler as described in the execution

phase. The target-preconfig.xml file is used for validation in

ECT before migration to ensure that the source node configuration, which has the

updated CIQ input, matches the configuration on the target node.

## 3.6 Finalize ENM AP Project for Target Node

The ENM Auto Provisioning project templates for the target node are imported into ECT

Configuration Files Handler.

Prerequisites

- Existing target node ENM AP project template ZIP file for migration is generated using the target node script.

Steps

1. Start ECT.
2. Click the Configuration Files Handler from the ECT main page.
3. Select the appropriate upgrade package and MOM for the target node.
4. Click Browse and import the &lt;target node&gt; ENM AP project template ZIP file as a configuration file.
5. Import the target-preconfig.xml file into ECT Configuration Files Handler as a Pre-configuration file.
6. Click Validate to verify that there are no errors in the configuration.
7. Generate and open a CIQ file template.
8. Update the following objects and parameters in the Values column of the CIQ file, according to the examples provided in MO Naming and RI Port Mapping Examples and MO Reference Mapping Examples: MO renaming RI port mapping MO reference mapping Note: Only MOs and parameters used in the source node are present in the CIQ file.
9. Upload the updated CIQ file to ECT Configuration Files Handler.
10. Substitute the CIQ file with the target node project template to generate the ENM AP expansion project file.

Results

An expansion project file for the target node is created and ready to be applied

during the execution phase.

# 4 Execution

During the execution phase, configurations are imported and applied using an ENM AP

expansion project file for each node. The expansion project file supports the application of

delta configurations, such as the addition and deletion of a radio access technology to an

existing node configuration. The source and target nodes are set to Maintenance mode during

this phase. After a node restart, the completion of the migration is verified and

complementary health checks are done.

Image Execution Phase Steps shows

the operational process of the execution phase:

## 4.1 Execute Migration on Source Node

When executing the source node migration, ENM AP applies an expansion project file to

the source node. Cells and termination points are locked, and the NETCONF delete operations

related to the migrated radio access technology are executed. In addition, the equipment

related to the migrated radio access technology is deleted from the source node.

Prerequisites

- Updated LKF is available.
- ENM AP expansion project file for source node deletion is available.
- Communication between on-site technician and off-site engineer is possible.

Steps

The following steps are performed off-site:

1. Import the updated LKF to the source node. Note: This step is skipped if Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode or non-connected mode is used.
2. Import the ENM AP project file for the source node generated in the preparation phase.
3. Notify the on-site technician to proceed with Step step 4.

The following steps are performed on-site:

4. Verify that the operational indicator is steady green on the Baseband unit. If the operational indicator is not steady green, contact the Network Operations Center.
5. Press the Maintenance Button on the Baseband unit between two and seven seconds. Result: Maintenance mode is activated and indicated by the Maintenance indicators with a steady blue light. This indicates that the unit is ready for migration. The traffic is locked on all cells in the node and radiation stops.
6. Disconnect the RI-cables from the source node.
7. Verify that the correct cables are removed from the source node that will later be moved over to the target node. Note: Do not connect any RI-cables to the target node at this point.
8. Press the Maintenance Button for less than seven seconds on the Baseband unit to trigger the migration flow execution in ENM AP. Note: Alternatively, this is done by the off-site engineer using ENM AP with the Resume command. Maintenance mode is deactivated and the Maintenance indicator turns off. The source node ENM AP project file is applied to the node. During this phase, sectors and termination points towards core and neighboring nodes are automatically set to locked. That is, the following cells, termination points, and MO classes are locked to avoid core signaling interference with the radio access configuration to be deleted: Table 8 Locked Cells, Termination Points, and MO Classes LTE NR EUtranCellFDD NRCellDU EUtranCellTDD TermPointToENodeB NbIotCell TermPointToGNodeB TermPointToGNB TermPointToAmf TermPointToENB NRSectorCarrier TermPointToMme
9. If execution is performed off-site, use ENM AP to monitor the progress until it reaches the Expansion Completed state.
10. If execution is performed on-site, monitor the Maintenance indicator until it shows a steady green light.
11. Restart the node manually using ENM GUI or ENM CLI. A node restart is triggered automatically when LTE RAT is removed. For more information, see Node Restart.
12. When the node is restarted, verify that all features and licenses are deactivated for the migrated radio access technology. If Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode is used, go to Configure Licenses Using IL in Non-Connected Mode. If the source node is decommissioned, contact Ericsson support in order to remove the fingerprint from ELIS.

Results

The migrated radio access technology is deleted from the source node.

## 4.2 Execute Migration on Target Node

When executing the target node migration, ENM AP applies the source node

configuration to the target node, locking the cells and termination points, and executing

the NETCONF create operations for the migrated radio access technology.

Prerequisites

- Source node migration is completed as described in Execute Migration on Source Node.
- Updated LKF is available.
- ENM AP expansion project file for target node is available.
- Communication between on-site technician and off-site engineer is possible.

Steps

The following steps are performed by the off-site engineer:

1. Import the updated LKF to the source node. Note: This step is skipped if Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode or non-connected mode is used.
2. Import the ENM AP project for the target node generated in the preparation phase.

The following steps are performed by the on-site technician:

3. Verify that the operational indicator is steady green on the Baseband unit. If the operational indicator is not steady green, contact the Network Operations Center.
4. Press the Maintenance Button on the Baseband unit between two and seven seconds. Result: Maintenance mode is activated and indicated by the Maintenance indicators with a steady blue light. This indicates that the unit is ready for migration. The traffic is locked on all cells in the node and radiation stops.
5. Connect the RI-cables that were previously disconnected from the source node to the RI-ports on the target node according to project specifications.
6. Verify that the cables are connected correctly to the target node.
7. Press the Maintenance Button for less than seven seconds on the Baseband unit to trigger the migration flow execution in ENM AP. Note: Alternatively, this is done from ENM AP using the resume command. Result: The Maintenance mode is deactivated and the Maintenance indicator turns off. The target node ENM AP project file is applied to the node. During this phase the following cells, termination points, and MO classes in the migrated configuration are locked: Table 9 Locked Cells, Termination Points, and MO Classes LTE NR EUtranCellFDD NRCellDU EUtranCellTDD TermPointToENodeB NbIotCell TermPointToGNodeB TermPointToGNB TermPointToAmf TermPointToENB NRSectorCarrier TermPointToMme
8. If execution is performed off-site, use ENM AP to monitor the progress until it reaches the Expansion Completed state.
9. If execution is performed on-site, monitor the Maintenance indicator until it shows a steady green light.
10. Restart the node manually using ENM GUI or ENM CLI. A node restart is required to update the resource allocation in the node for the new radio access configuration. For more information, see Node Restart.

The following steps are performed off-site when the node is restarted:

11. Unlock the following cells, termination points, and MO classes on the target node using ENM GUI or ENM CLI: Table 10 Locked Cells, Termination Points, and MO Classes LTE NR EUtranCellFDD NRCellDU EUtranCellTDD TermPointToENodeB NbIotCell TermPointToGNodeB TermPointToGNB TermPointToAmf TermPointToENB NRSectorCarrier TermPointToMme
12. Verify that all required features and licenses on the target node are activated. If Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode is used, go to Configure Licenses Using IL in Non-Connected Mode.
13. Activate user-defined PM subscriptions used on the source node for the migrated radio access technology.

Results

The source node radio access technology configuration is applied to the target

node.

## 4.3 Finalize Radio Access Migration

After the migration process is completed, the final steps ensure that the migrated node

is operational and healthy.

### 4.3.1 Configure Licenses Using Instantaneous Licensing in Non-Connected Mode

If Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode is used, the LKF for the target node

must be handled manually using ENM and SSP-LKM after completed migration.

Prerequisites

- Radio access migration is completed and Integration Unlock or System Trigger Unlock is triggered on the target node.

Steps

1. Log on to ENM.
2. Run the Radio Node License Request Flow to generate an LRF.
3. Submit the LRF to SSP-LKM to request a new LKF for the target node.
4. Download the generated LKF ZIP and upload it to ENM.
5. Open Software and Hardware Manager &gt; License Administration in ENM.
6. Import the LKF to the target node using Import Key Files.
7. Install the updated LKF on the target node.

### 4.3.2 Complementary Health Checks

It is recommended to perform complementary health checks to verify the health status

of a node after a completed migration.

Health checks can be performed in the following ways:

Node Health Check (NHC)

The NHC application enables the user to run node health status checks and generate

reports of such checks using ENM. For more information, see ENM Online Help in

ELEX.

Automated Health Check (AHC)

AHC provides health checks and diagnostics using ENM Flow Automation. For more

information, see Manage Automated Health Check.

Node Health Validator (NHV)

NHV provides node health status and health validation in case of troubleshooting, or

after hardware installation and replacement using LMT port or ENM. For more

information, see Node Health Validator.

## 4.4 Rollback Radio Access Migration

If the migration fails and cannot be resolved, the source and target node must be

restored to a state before the migration was executed.

The rollback procedure is manual and consists of the following steps:

Steps

1. Reconnect the CPRI links to the source node in the same way as before migration.
2. Restore both source and target node with the backups created during the preparation phase.

# 5 Configuration Guides for Radio Access Migration

## 5.1 Configure a New Baseband Unit for Radio Access Migration

A factory-reset Baseband unit must be properly configured as a target node before a

radio access technology can be migrated to it.

ECT standalone is used for defining the configuration files for the new Baseband

unit. In this example, ECT is used to configure the following parameters for the

target node:

- OAM network setup
- Baseband hardware type
- Transport network for the migrated radio access technologyNote: It is possible to configure another radio access technology on the new Baseband unit, such as NR, when preparing the target node for LTE migration.

Prerequisites

- A factory-reset Baseband unit from RAN Compute group 4, 5 or 6 is available.
- The Baseband unit fulfills the requirements and prerequisites for migration stated in Radio Access Migration Requirements.

Steps

1. Open the ECT Configuration Generator in ECT.
2. Select upgrade package type and revision that corresponds to the type and software release of the Baseband unit on the target node.
3. Select the hardware type of the Baseband unit in the Equipment menu.
4. Specify an OAM router, associated interface, and IP address configuration in the Transport menu.
5. Specify a router for the migrated radio access network technology.
6. Specify the number of interfaces and IP addresses so that it matches the configuration setup of the radio access technology in the source node.
7. Specify the synchronization setup of the target node.
8. Specify the node integration setup in the Node Integration menu. For example, the associated OSS model identity for the software and upgrade package name.
9. Select one of the following integration methods: Zero touch LMT
10. Validate all configurations.
11. Export the configurations.
12. Import the configurations to the ECT Configuration Files Handler.
13. Generate a CIQ template.
14. Fill in the CIQ template according to the project specifications. For information about CIQ guidelines and example configurations for integration, see CIQ Guidelines and Baseband Radio Node Use Case Instructions in Manage Equipment Configuration Tool.
15. Import and substitute the configuration with the updated CIQ template.

## 5.2 Example Configuration for Transport Network Using a NETCONF File

A NETCONF file is used to set up the backhaul transport network for a target

node.

The NETCONF file must be applied to the target node before radio access migration is

started. This can be done as part of an ENM AP expansion project, or using ENM and AMOS.

For instructions, see the ENM Online Help library in ELEX.

This NETCONF-based example has the following properties:

- Separate and new Virtual Router (VR) and VLAN are used for the migrated radio access technology.
- The number of IP addresses for transport network communication on the target node matches the number of IP addresses configured at the source node.
- No IPsec is used for the migrated radio access technology, that is, the network is trusted.
- The configuration contains the following MOs and IDs: Table 11 Example Configuration MOs and IDs MO ID Router LTE InterfaceIPv4 1 VlanPort LTE.IF1\_v4 AddressIPv4 1 RouteTableIPv4Static 1 The items marked with (:&lt;variable&gt;:) in the NETCONF file must be replaced with values according to the project specifications.

## 5.3 Manual Handling of Configured Peer Node IP Addresses

The related manual configuration for remote node IP addresses must be properly

handled during radio access migration.

If the IP address of a peer NR node within an NR EN-DC setup is configured manually in

the LTE node without using ANR, the IP address must be updated manually at the migration

of the NR node.

Because

of the NR node getting a new IP address at migration, the configuration in the LTE node

must be updated with the new NR node address, this is configured using the

TermPointToGNB MO in the LTE node.

If the IP address of a peer NR Standalone

node used for Xn

interface is configured

manually without

using ANR, the IP address must be updated manually at the migration of

the referred NR node.

The

remote IP address is configured through the

TermPointToGNodeB

MO in the NR

node.

If the IP address of a peer LTE node used for the X2 interface is configured manually

without using ANR, the IP address must be updated manually at the migration of the

referred LTE node. The remote IP or IPsec address is configured through the

TermPointToENB MO in the LTE node or the

TermPointToENodeB MO in the NR node.

For all migration cases, the synchronization configuration at the target node may need to

be reconfigured after migration, because the synchronization setup is not migrated.
