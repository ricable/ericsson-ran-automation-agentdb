## 1.1 Services and Bearers Overview

This section describes the basics of LTE bearers and services associated

with those bearers.

Figure 1 provides an overview of bearers in

the Evolved Packet System (EPS).

Figure 1   Bearers in EPS

Bearers represent communication links to UE, as described in Table 1.

UE in idle mode does not have any bearers established. The UE-state

is RRC\_IDLE.

UE in connected mode has at least a Signaling Radio Bearer (SRB)

established to a cell, that is, the serving cell. The corresponding

UE state is RRC\_CONNECTED.

Table 1   Bearers in EPS

| Bearer       | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Radio bearer | Carries data over the air interface, the Uu. Types of radio bearers include:    Data Radio Bearer (DRB) for the user plane     SRB for the control plane                                                           |
| S1 bearer    | Carries user plane data between the eNodeB and the SGW.                                                                                                                                                            |
| S5/S8 bearer | Carries user plane data between the SGW and the PDN-GW.                                                                                                                                                            |
| EPS bearer   | Carries user plane data between the UE and the PDN-GW. Each EPS bearer is mapped to a DRB, an S1 bearer, and an S5/S8 bearer.                                                                                      |
| E-RAB        | The DRB and the S1 bearer together are some times addressed as E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearer (E-RAB). It carries user plane data between the UE and the SGW. E-RAB is the name used in the 3GPP S1AP specifications. |
| S1AP bearer  | Carries control plane data between the eNodeB and the MME.  The eNodeB handles much of the communication with UE. This means that not all communication over the SRB is relayed over to the S1AP bearer.           |

## 1.2 Radio Bearers

There are two types of RB:

- Data Radio Bearer (DRB) which is configured in the DataRadioBearer MO class. The DRB is used to transfer the user plane data between the UE and the network.
- Signaling Radio Bearer (SRB) which is configured in the SignalingRadioBearer MO class. The SRB is used to transfer the control plane signaling between the UE and the network.

Radio Bearers can be configured with three modes for each QCI:

- AM (Acknowledged Mode)
- UM (Unacknowledged Mode)
- TM (Transparent Mode)

The default values of the RB-related attributes generally ensure

smooth operation, but it is possible for the operator to change some

attributes to optimize performance.

## 1.3 CS Fallback

Since LTE is a packet switched network, circuit switched (CS) services cannot be processed in

E-UTRAN cells. CS Fallback enables LTE subscribers to use CS domain services in CDMA, GSM, and

WCDMA networks.

The basic CS Fallback procedure is:

1. The UE receives a mobile terminating voice call from the existing CS domain by the core network.
2. On receiving a paging message, the UE recognizes that the network is calling for CS-based voice.
3. The UE switches from LTE to a CS-based network (CDMA, GSM or WCDMA).
4. An acceptance response is then sent, from the UE to the CS system.
5. Voice service is initiated and performed on the CS network.
6. When the call ends, the UE switches back to LTE.

The following features control CS fallback:

- CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs
- CS Fallback to CDMA 1X
- CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN
- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X
- Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback
- PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN
- Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection

## 1.4 Cell User Capacity and QoS

These attributes exist in MO classes

EUtranCellFDD

and

EUtranCellTDD

The values of both attributes noOfPucchSrUsers and noOfPucchCqiUsers must be set according

to the following rules:

- The values may not be set to 0.
- The maximum values depend on cell bandwidth and the number of cells.
- The values must not violate the limits on maximum number of PUCCH PRB per cell as defined in Control Channel Dimensioning.

## 1.5 Additional UE Output Power Restrictions

Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) can be signalled by a Network Signaling value to

the UE to meet additional requirements in specific deployment scenarios and specific frequency

bands (bands 1, 2, 4, 10, 13, 26, 35, 36 and 48).

The following cell attribute is related to additional UE output

power restrictions:

## 1.6 PUCCH Overdimensioning

The licensed feature PUCCH Overdimensioning provides the following operator configurable cell attributes in

MO classes

EUtranCellFDD

and

EUtranCellTDD

:

- pucchOverdimensioning Specifies the number of resource blocks that the PUCCH must be shifted at each band edge. Default value is 0, which corresponds to no PUCCH overdimensioning The configured value of the pucchOverdimensioning parameter has to be set to a value less than, or equal to, the result of the following: The total number of PRBs representing the UL system bandwidth divided by 2 (where the result is rounded down to the closest integer), minus the total number of PRBs allocated for PUCCH divided by 2, minus the total number of PRBs allocated for PRACH divided by 2. If the above condition is not fulfilled a Resource Configuration Failure alarm with the error description slogan PUCCH Overdimensioning configuration invalid is raised.
- puschMaxNrOfPrbsPerUe Specifies the maximum number of PRBs that the network allows any UE to use for PUSCH in a cell. This limitation is needed to fulfill some of the additional spectrum emission requirements according to 3GPP TS 36.101 in conjunction with PUCCH overdimensioning. Default value is 100, which means that no limitation is imposed.

To achieve desired behavior the PUCCH Overdimensioning functions

can also be used together with PUSCH Blocking, and Additional Maximum

Power Reduction (A-MPR), described in Additional UE Output Power Restrictions. PUSCH blocking is achieved by

use of the UL ICIC (Uplink Inter-Cell Interference Coordination).

For detailed information about the feature, see PUCCH Overdimensioning.

## 1.7 PDCCH Power Boost

In some applications, like beamforming and heterogeneous networks with small cells, it

can be beneficial to increase the PDCCH power. The PDSCH benefits from the beamforming

gain, but PDCCH does not because it is not beamformed. The PDCCH power might need to be

increased.

For heterogeneous network scenarios with cell range extension, the PDCCH can suffer heavy

interference in the small cells and can benefit from increased power.

The boosting of the maximum CCE aggregation level is active when the license is activated

and the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax attribute is larger than 0

dB.

The operator can set the maximum PDCCH power boost of the maximum CCE aggregation level

in steps of 1 dB from 0 dB (no boost) up to 6 dB through the

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax attribute.

When the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax attribute is set to a non-zero

value, the UE-specific PDCCHs that require more than eight CCEs to meet the BLER target

are boosted. If four is the maximum CCE aggregation level, UE-specific PDCCHs that

require more than four CCES to meet the BLER target are boosted.

For UE-specific PDCCHs that require more power than value of the

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax to meet the BLER target, the

power increase is limited to value of the

EUtranCellFDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchPowerBoostMax attribute.

The LTE Flexible Power Boost for Initial Access feature introduces flexible power

boosting of random access Msg2. PDSCH or PDCCH power, or both can be boosted for Msg2 as

needed. The maximum boosted power is configurable.

The PDCCH Power Boost feature is required for the LTE Flexible Boost for Initial Access

feature to work. When both features are enabled, the LTE Flexible Boost for Initial

Access feature has higher priority for Msg2 power boosting. For more information, see

PDCCH Power Boost and LTE Flexible Boost for Initial Access.

## 1.8 PDCCH Coverage Extension

In dense radio networks interference is always present. In some cases it affects the

PDCCH performance severely, which reduces the coverage area. In these scenarios the DCI

format used in downlink, with a larger data size than that used for uplink grants, will

make downlink limit the coverage. The PDCCH Coverage Extension feature makes it possible

to reduce the size of the downlink assignment, by using DCI 1A format instead of DCI

2/2A.

This is possible to perform for:

- SRB
- Voice Bearer
- The transmission on the voice bearer or SRB following after a DTX verdict

The feature is enabled by setting the following parameters in MO EUtranCellFDD or MO EUtranCellTDD:

- pdcchCovImproveSrb : PDCCH DCI format 1A is used for SRB to increase transmission success rate and to minimize interruption time.
- pdcchCovImproveQci1 : PDCCH DCI format 1A is used to increase mean opinion score (MOS) for QCI1 in high interference/high path loss scenarios.
- pdcchCovImproveDtx : PDCCH DCI format 1A is used for first re-transmission due to DTX of SRB and QCI1.

The DCI format is only changed when the eNB estimates the need for it, based on RF

conditions.

For more information see PDCCH Coverage Extension.

## 1.9 Radio Connection Supervision

The Radio Connection Supervision feature monitors radio connections and bearers to

ensure the efficient use of resources.

The attributes of the Rcs MO class determine the characteristics of the

Radio Connection Supervision feature in the following ways:

- The Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute determines the time for which a UE can be inactive before it is released. Setting a suitable value for the Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute improves performance. Setting the attribute value too low results in too frequent release of the UEs. Setting the attribute value too high results in using more system resources than needed in some of the UEs.
- The value of the Rcs.tNasInactivityTimer attribute determines the time for which a UE can be inactive before it is released after a NAS signal is received in the downlink or in the uplink. The NAS inactivity timer must be configured to ensure that the services that are run on the control plane are completed before the inactivity expires.

## 1.10 Resource Allocation Strategy

Resource allocation specifies how the scheduler performs frequency

resources allocation to each UE being scheduled together at a specific

time. It is within the QoS Configuration and can be configured per

QCI.

The resource allocation parameters are related to the licensed

features Downlink Frequency-Selective Scheduling and Uplink Frequency-Selective

Scheduling. Individual licenses are required for each feature.

By default, frequency selective scheduling is turned off for QCIs

with resource allocation strategy parameter value set to RESOURCE\_FAIR. Activate frequency selective scheduling

for a certain bearer type by setting the parameter value to FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE.

When resource allocation is set to FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE, the scheduler attempts to schedule each UE in different parts of

the band where their channel qualities are better to provide better

cell capacity and coverage.

The behavior of resource allocation is configured using the following

attributes in MO class

QciProfilePredefined

and

QciProfileOperatorDefined

:

- dlResourceAllocationStrategy Specifies whether downlink frequency-selective scheduling must be used for each QCI.
- resourceAllocationStrategy Specifies whether uplink frequency-selective scheduling must be used for each QCI.

Parameter values can be changed without disabling the cell.

For more information on Resource Allocation Strategy, see the documents Downlink Frequency-Selective

Scheduling, Uplink Frequency-Selective

Scheduling, and Scheduler.

## 1.11 Positioning

This section describes the Observed Time Difference of Arrival

(OTDOA) positioning method. The attributes of the

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

MO class determine the OTDOA characteristics The Positioning

Reference Signals (PRS) is transmitted over the entire bandwidth.

All cells participating in OTDOA positioning must be configured with

PRS. OTDOA can be activated per cell.

## 1.12 Radio Network Quality of Service

Every QCI is configured in the same way regardless of whether it is a predefined or

operator-defined QCI. The only difference is that the parameters used to configure predefined

QCIs belong to the QciProfilePredefined MO class, while operator-defined

QCIs belong to the QciProfileOperatorDefined MO class.

Radio Bearer QCI

QCI relates to the DRB, consequently, the Signalling Radio Bearer (SRB) is not affected by

QciTable MOs.

There are two types of QCI:

- Predefined QCIs (numbered 0-9, 65, 66, 69, 70) that are always present and are configured in the QciProfilePredefined MO class. No license is required. Note: The QCIs 65, 66, 69, 70 are mission-critical QCIs, that are only used for E-RAB procedures if the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is installed and active.
- Operator-defined QCIs are only present if created by the operator, configured in the MO class QciProfileOperatorDefined. Operator defined QCIs can only be created if the licensed feature Operator Defined QCI is installed and active. Note: It is possible to create up to 9 operator-defined QCIs. Each operator-defined QCI must have a unique identity defined by the attribute QciProfileOperatorDefined.qci.

The predefined mission-critical QCI profiles use QCI values that are also available for

operator-defined QCI profiles through the Operator Defined QCI feature. The usage of these

QCI profiles is determined by the feature state of the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk and the

Operator Defined QCI features:

- If none of the features are active, these QCI profiles are not used.
- If only the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is active, the predefined QCI profiles are used.
- If only the Operator Defined QCI feature is active, and there are operator-defined QCI profiles overlapping with the predefined mission-critical QCIs, the operator-defined QCI profiles are used.
- If both features are active, and there are operator-defined QCI profiles overlapping with the predefined mission-critical QCIs, the predefined QCI profiles are used.

The default values of the QCI-related attributes generally ensure

smooth operation, but it is possible for the operator to change some

attributes to optimize performance.

Changing the Mapping between QCI and DSCP

The attribute dscp defines the mapping between QCI and Differentiated

Services Code Point (DSCP). This corresponds to mapping from RAN to Transport Network.

The operator's view of the QCI to DSCP mapping may differ from that of the default values.

If so, the operator can change the value of the dscp attributes to

better reflect that view of the relationship between QCI and DSCP.

Do!

Inappropriate settings may cause significant problems. Read the

information below carefully.

Setting an inappropriate value for the dscp attribute may severely

degrade performance.

## 1.13 Logical Channel Groups

The Logical Channel Groups (LCGs) determine the level of granularity

with respect to the buffer status reports, which in turn defines the

granularity on which Uplink (UL) scheduling is based.

The attribute logicalChannelGroupRef (

QciProfilePredefined.logicalChannelGroupRef

or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.logicalChannelGroupRef

) assigns an LCG for a QCI. Each QCI must be assigned to

one of the four LCGs. Note that SRBs are preassigned to LCG 0, one

shall therefore be cautious with respect to the QCIs assigned to this

LCG and typically only assign low-intensity traffic similar to signalling.

An LCG may have several QCIs assigned to it.

UL Rate Control

The priority indicated by the QCI is also used when assigning Logical

Channel Priorities for DRBs. These Logical Channel Priorities are

transferred to the User Equipment (UE) by means of RRC signalling

and reflects the priorities indicated by the QCI. The UE then uses

these assigned Logical Channel Priorities for UL Rate Control according

to 3GPP TS 36.321. When assigning Logical

Channel Priorities to Radio Bearers, the RBS ensures that the SRBs

are given higher priority than DRBs.

## 1.14 RRC Timers Per QCI

The RRC Timers per QCI function makes it possible for the operator to configure timers

per QCI. The RRC timers are used internally in eNodeB or between eNodeBs at handover.

The function makes it possible to have different sets of timer settings depending on

which service, such as voice, data, or other, that is currently in use, to achieve

optimal user experience.

The total number of timer configurations are 18.

MO attributes for timers:

- TimerProfile.tWaitForRrcConnReest
- TimerProfile.tRrcConnectionReconfiguration
- TimerProfile.tRrcConnReest
- TimerProfile.tRelocOverall

MO attributes for RRC definitions per QCI profile:

- QciProfilePredefined.timerPriority
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.timerPriority
- QciProfilePredefined.timerProfileRef
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.timerProfileRef

The timerPriority value should preferably be unique across all the

configured QciProfilePredefined and

QciProfileOperatorDefined

MOC instances - except for instances where the timerProfileId is

the same. That is, instances that share the same timerProfileId may

have the same timerPriority value.

When there exist several Timer configuration on QCIs with the same highest value of

timerPriority, the lowest QCI will be selected.

If a TimerProfile referenced by the parameter timeProfileRef does

not exist, the legacy RRC timer values from the following MO attributes will be

used:

- Rrc.tWaitForRrcConnReest
- Rrc.tRrcConnectionReconfiguration
- Rrc.tRrcConnReest
- tRelocOverall

## 1.15 Differential Uplink Power Control

This section describes how to handle PUSCH closed-loop power control. There are two

algorithms for PUSCH closed-loop power control: P0-based and SINR-based.

This feature is enabled by setting the parameters in MO EUtranCellFDD/EUtranCellTDD:

enableSinrUplinkClpc, the operator can set the following

parameters in MO EUtranCellFDD/EUtranCellTDD for switching between these two

algorithms.

- rxSinrTargetClpc: SINR target value for PUSCH SINR-based closed-loop power control.
- interferenceThresholdSinrClpc: Threshold value for measured noise plus interference level. If measured noise plus interference is higher than interferenceThresholdSinrClpc, then the SINR-based UL closed-loop power control can be considered.
- ulPsdLoadThresholdSinrClpc: Threshold of UL Tx power per PRB for estimation of cell UL power load. If UL Tx power over a set percentage of UL valid PRBs are all lower than ulPsdLoadThresholdSinrClpc, then the SINR-based UL closed-loop power control can be considered.

## 1.16 Supported UM and AM DRB Combinations

The eNodeB sets up the AM and UM bearer configurations for the UE based on the value

of FGI 7, FGI 20, and the flexibleUM-AM-Combinations.

Flexible UM and AM bearer configurations are supported for UEs which report capability

for flexibleUM-AM-Combinations introduced in 3GPP TS 36.331 version

15.3.0.

Table 2   AM and UM Combinations

|   FGI 7                                 (Radio                                 Link                                 Control                                 UM) |   FGI 20 (8 DRBs) |   flexibleUM-AM-Combinations | Limits for AM and UM DRB Combinations       |

If

the target eNodeB does not support the bearer combination sent by the source eNodeB,

some of the bearers are not set up, and the bearers with the lowest priority are

removed.

When the default bearer is released

because

it has the lowest priority, the UE does not accept the configuration

without a default bearer and

RRC

connection

Re-establishment is expected to be initiated with

Handover Failure marked as cause.

# 2 Procedures

## 2.1 Configure RLC AM Bearer

Steps

RLC AM Bearers are configured by performing the following procedure:

1. Set the RLC mode to AM for the QCI using the following attributes: The QciProfilePredefined.rlcMode attribute if the QCI is predefined. The QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcMode attribute if the QCI is operator-defined.
2. Set the maximum number of ARQ (RLC) retransmissions before Radio Bearer cannot be recovered using the following attributes: The DataRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold attribute to limit the number of downlink retransmissions of AM data PDUs for DRBs. The DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute to limit the number of uplink retransmissions of AM data PDUs for DRBs. The SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold attribute to limit the number of downlink retransmissions of AM data PDUs for SRBs. The SignalingRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute to limit the number of uplink retransmissions of AM data PDUs for SRBs.
3. Set the timer supervising the procedure of polling from an RLC AM entity using the following attributes: The DataRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl attribute to define time lapsed between two consecutive downlink retransmissions of AM data PDUs for DRBs. The DataRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitUl attribute to define time lapsed between two consecutive uplink retransmissions of an AM data PDUs for DRBs. The SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl attribute to define time lapsed between two consecutive downlink retransmissions of AM data PDUs for SRBs. The SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitUl attribute to define time lapsed between two consecutive uplink retransmissions of an AM data PDUs for SRBs. Do!Inappropriate settings may cause significant problems. Read the information below carefully. Setting inappropriate values for the tPollRetransmitDl and tPollRetransmitUl attributes can cause the following negative effects: If set too low in comparison with the default recommended one, it leads to unnecessary poll-triggered retransmissions when the length of the poll retransmit timer is smaller than the average ARQ feedback round-trip time. It more likely happens under high connected user load where the ARQ round-trip time typically increases, especially for lower priority QCIs (for example QCI 9). Observability in KPIs: Downlink and Uplink Throughput becomes worse. If set too high in comparison with the default recommended one, it leads to increasing time required for successful delivery the RLC data in cases where the original transmission with poll is not received by the receiver or the RLC status feedback is lost over the air. For DRBs, it potentially affects peak UE TCP throughput in cases where TCP sender window is full and cannot proceed with sending until it gets some TCP ACKs back. For SRBs, it potentially leads to longer time lapsed before the RRC message is delivered successfully, especially in mobility cases where the UE is quickly moving out of the cell coverage, it affects handover success rates. Observability in KPIs: Mobility Success Rate becomes worse. Do!Inappropriate settings may cause significant problems. Read the information below carefully. Setting inappropriate values for the dlMaxRetxThreshold and ulMaxRetxThreshold attributes can cause the following negative effects: If set too low in comparison with the default recommended one, it leads to drop in retainability, that is, increase in cases of E-RAB abnormal releases. Observability in KPIs: E-RAB Retainability becomes worse. If set too high in comparison with the default recommended one, it leads to the following: Waiting a much longer time before declaring Radio Link Failure for UEs in the poor coverage area. Increasing the load on the scheduler by scheduling more HARQ and ARQ retransmissions. An adverse effect of reducing cell throughput, especially from moderate to high connected user load. Observability in KPIs: Downlink and Uplink Throughput becomes worse. Setting the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute too high can also result in increased uplink RLC buffer utilization. The following PM counters can be used to observe this impact: BbProcessingResource.pmRlcPduBufferUtilUlDistr BbProcessingResource.pmRlcPduBufferCongStatusUlDistr EUtranCellFDD.pmRlcPduBufferUtilUlCellDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmRlcPduBufferUtilUlCellDistr
4. Set the maximum number of allowed RLC PDUs before requesting a status report using the following attributes: The DataRadioBearer.dlPollPDU attribute to define the maximum number of downlink RLC AM PDUs for DRBs. The DataRadioBearer.ulPollPDU attribute to define the maximum number of uplink RLC AM PDUs for DRBs. The SignalingRadioBearer.dlPollPDU attribute to define the maximum number of downlink RLC AM PDUs for SRBs. The SignalingRadioBearer.ulPollPDU attribute to define the maximum number of uplink RLC AM PDUs for SRBs.
5. Set the timer which is used by the receiving end of the RLC entity using the following attributes: The QciProfilePredefined.tReorderingUl attribute to set the timer for DRBs with the predefined QCI. The QciProfileOperatorDefined.tReorderingUl attribute to set the timer for DRBs with the operator-defined QCI. The SignalingRadioBearer.tReorderingUl attribute to set the timer for SRBs.

### 2.1.1 Optimization of RRC Connection Release on Cell Level

The RRC Connection Release procedure can be optimized on cell level by reducing the

RLC retransmissions.

The Optimized RRC Connection Release Control feature can be set on the cell level to

complete or replace the following attributes:

- SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold
- SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl

The feature allows the configuration of the maximum number of RLC retransmissions and

maximum time of poll retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure on cell

level. The parameters of the feature can function separately.

The following attributes take effect if the Optimized RRC Connection Release Control

feature is enabled:

- The feature uses the following parameters to indicate the maximum number of RLC retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure: EUtranCellFDD.dlMaxRetxRrcReleaseThr EUtranCellTDD.dlMaxRetxRrcReleaseThr Note: If the license is disabled, or the parameter values are set to -1, the SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold attribute takes effect.
- The feature uses the following parameters to indicate the maximum time of poll retransmissions for the RRC Connection Release procedure: EUtranCellFDD.tPollRetxRrcReleaseDl EUtranCellTDD.tPollRetxRrcReleaseDl Note: If the license is disabled, or the parameter values are set to -1, the SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl attribute takes effect.

### 2.1.2 Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling

Uplink RLC buffer congestion handling procedures are applied to Radio Bearers after

the RLC PDU buffer is exhausted.

If the uplink RLC PDU buffer is exhausted, the following conditions are checked for each

Radio Bearer before applying the congestion handling procedures:

- The amount of uplink RLC buffer space that is occupied
- The time passed since the last RLC transmission window advancement

Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling Levels

The following table shows the uplink RLC buffer congestion handling levels and the

corresponding actions performed by the eNodeB based on congestion severity:

Table 3   Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling Levels and Corresponding eNodeB

Actions

| Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling Level   | eNodeB Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

All                                         RLC SNs are accepted for all other Radio Bearers.                                                     |
| Smart Severe Congestion Handling              | The RLC SNs greater than the first missing SN are rejected                                         for stalled Acknowledged Mode Radio Bearers.

The BbProcessingResource.pmRlcPduBufferCongStatusUlDistr PM

counter shows the level of the uplink RLC buffer congestion:

Radio Bearer Observability for Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion

Handling

The following PM counters allow the operator to observe and calculate the number of E-RABs affected by the uplink RLC buffer congestion handling procedures:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabUlRlcBufferCongHandl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabUlRlcBufferCongHandl

If a

Radio

Bearer is affected by the uplink RLC buffer congestion handling,

it becomes flagged when eNodeB performs the release. Flagged

Radio

Bearers trigger the stepping of these PM counters. The following

formula can be used to calculate the percentage of E-RABs affected by the uplink RLC

buffer congestion handling procedures:

PM

counters

in the denominator count E-RABs in both Acknowledged and Unacknowledged Mode, but

only radio bearers in Acknowledged Mode can be affected by congestion handling. The

following QCI versions of the PM

counters

associated with Acknowledged Mode must be used in the denominator to determine the

ratio of Acknowledged Mode radio bearers affected by the uplink RLC congestion

handling procedures:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabRelAbnormalEnbQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabRelAbnormalEnbQci
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabRelMmeQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabRelMmeQci
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabRelNormalEnbQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabRelNormalEnbQci

Configuration of the Smart Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling Function

The

Smart

Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling function can be configured

by the operator if necessary, as different sites might need different settings.

The following RlcConfiguration MO class attributes are used for

controlling the Smart Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion Handling function:

- The RlcConfiguration.ulRlcStalledRbqLenThr attribute defines the number of RLC PDU segments that must be stored in the Radio Bearer queue for an Acknowledged Mode Radio Bearer to be considered as stalled.
- The RlcConfiguration.ulRlcStalledWinAdvTimeThr attribute defines the number of milliseconds that has to pass since the last time the uplink RLC window has advanced for an Acknowledged Mode Radio Bearer to be considered as stalled.

The Radio Bearer is considered stalled, and the Smart Uplink RLC Buffer Congestion

Handling function is used if at least one of the thresholds set by these attributes

are met.

### 2.1.3 LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

The feature allows

for

the automatic adjustment of the uplink RLC retransmission threshold to reduce uplink RLC

buffer use.

The LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold feature introduces the option to

adjust the uplink RLC retransmission threshold automatically in congested cells to

reduce total uplink RLC buffer use. The feature allows for a drop in total uplink RLC

buffer use without affecting non-congested cells.

If the feature is operational in the node, the uplink RLC retransmission threshold is

adjusted in cells that are defined as congested based on the

RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferCellThresUlMaxRetx attribute.

Thresholds can also be set to define when the feature activates and deactivates for

congested cells.

Configuration of the LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

Feature

The LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold feature introduces the

following attributes to adjust the uplink RLC retransmission threshold:

- The RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferCellThresUlMaxRetx attribute defines the maximum percentage of total uplink RLC buffer capacity that can be used by a single cell before the cell is considered congested.
- The DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute defines the value that is used for new connections in congested cells if uplink RLC buffer use is high. This attribute is used instead of the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute in congested cells.
- The RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresHigh attribute defines the maximum percentage of total uplink RLC buffer that can be used before new connections in congested cells start to use the value from the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute.
- The RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresLow attribute defines the percentage of total uplink RLC buffer in use that is used as a threshold for the feature to prevent oscillation. If the current uplink RLC buffer use drops below the threshold defined by the RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresLow attribute, all new connections in the node use the value of the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute.

The feature is operational in the node if the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is set to a

value less than the value of the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute. If both

attributes are set to the same value, the feature is not operational in the

node.

Data Radio Bearer Observability for the LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission

Threshold Feature

The RlcConfiguration.pmRlcUlMaxRetxThrAdapt PM counter is used to

observe the number of DRBs configured with the regular and the congested uplink RLC

maximum retransmission threshold value. This PM counter can also be used to observe

the number of DRBs configured with

no

uplink RLC maximum retransmission threshold value.

## 2.2 Configure RLC UM Bearer

In order to set up UM Radio Bearer the RLC in Unacknowledged Mode

feature license must be operable.

RLC UM Bearer is configured by performing the following procedure:

Steps

1. Set the RLC mode to UM for the QCI using: The QciProfilePredefined.rlcMode attribute if the QCI is predefined. The QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcMode attribute if the QCI is operator-defined.
2. Set the UM SN field size using: The QciProfilePredefined.rlcSNLength attribute to change the length of SN in the RLC PDU for the Radio Bearer with the predefined QCI. The QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcSNLength attribute to change the length of SN in the RLC PDU for the Radio Bearer with the operator-defined QCI. The QciProfilePredefined.pdcpSNLength attribute to change the length of SN in the PDCP PDU for the Radio Bearer with the predefined QCI. The QciProfileOperatorDefined.pdcpSNLength attribute to change the length of SN in the PDCP PDU for the Radio Bearer with the operator-defined QCI. Do!Inappropriate settings may cause significant problems. Read the information below carefully. Setting inappropriate values for the QciProfilePredefined.rlcSNLength, QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcSNLength, QciProfilePredefined.pdcpSNLength and QciProfileOperatorDefined.pdcpSNLength attributes may cause negative effects: If set too low, it leads to wrap around on the sequence numbers and hence increase drop rate. The attributes within an Ericsson cluster, either for QciProfilePredefined.rlcSNLength, QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcSNLength or QciProfilePredefined.pdcpSNLength, QciProfileOperatorDefined.pdcpSNLength are not to vary between nodes. The same value is to be set for QciProfilePredefined.rlcSNLength and QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcSNLength for all nodes in the cluster. The QciProfilePredefined.pdcpSNLength and QciProfilePredefined.pdcpSNLength attributes are recommended to be set to the same value as well within all nodes of the cluster, as setting these attributes to different values between nodes might trigger the full reconfiguration option.
3. Set the timer which is used by the receiving end of the RLC entity using: The QciProfilePredefined.tReorderingUl attribute to set the timer for DRB with the predefined QCI. The QciProfileOperatorDefined.tReorderingUl attribute to set the timer for DRB with the operator-defined QCI.

## 2.3 Configure Frequency Priority for Fallback to UTRAN

To configure priorities between the fallback frequencies, do the

following:

Steps

1. Set the following parameters on all instances of the UtranFreqRelation TOOLTIPFLAG MO class: csFallbackPrio TOOLTIPFLAG csFallbackPrioEC TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.4 Configure Frequency Priority for Fallback to GERAN

To configure conditions for redirection to GERAN, use the following

attributes in the

GeranFreqGroupRelation

MO class:

Steps

1. csFallbackPrio TOOLTIPFLAG
2. csFallbackPrioEC TOOLTIPFLAG
3. mobilityActionCsfb TOOLTIPFLAG There is no corresponding priority for CDMA2000 1xRTT. The UE is registered in the LTE network and in the CDMA2000 network to fallback to.

## 2.5 Configure CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

To configure conditions for CS Fallback to CDMA 1X (CDMA2000 1xRTT),

use the following attributes:

Steps

1. BandClassPrioCdma1xRtt.freqCdma TOOLTIPFLAG in the MO class RATFreqPrio TOOLTIPFLAG. Carrier frequency within a CDMA2000 1xRTT band. When the value is configured to -1000, the parameter is ignored and the csFallbackPrio and csFallbackPrioEC apply to all frequencies within one band.
2. BandClassPrioCdma1xRtt.cdma1xRttBandClass TOOLTIPFLAG in the MO class RATFreqPrio TOOLTIPFLAG. 1xRTT frequency band in which the 1xRTT Carrier can be found.
3. BandClassPrioCdma1xRtt.cellReselectionPriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the MO class RATFreqPrio TOOLTIPFLAG. Absolute priority of the concerned carrier frequency, as used by the cell reselection procedure. Note: The cellReselectionPriority TOOLTIPFLAG within a 1xRTTBandClass must be the same.
4. BandClassPrioCdma1xRtt.csFallbackPrio TOOLTIPFLAG in the MO class RATFreqPrio TOOLTIPFLAG. CDMA2000 1xRTT CS fallback frequency priority. This parameter prioritizes CDMA2000 1xRTT frequencies among all frequencies related to the cell for UE in connected mode. 0 means the lowest priority.

## 2.11 Configure an ASG with Dynamic BLER Target

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature enables the configuration of a dynamic BLER

target for ASGs.

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is beneficial for services without strict

packet delay requirements, for example internet traffic. The feature introduces a

machine learning algorithm that periodically adjusts the downlink BLER target for

each UE in the configured ASGs. This is done according to the current inter-cell

interference situation.

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Create a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance to define the ASG.
2. Define the percentage of the UE population to be included in the ASG by setting the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to a positive value. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is higher than 60. The maximum BLER target can be decreased, if any of the following PIs increase: PDCP Downlink Packet Loss Rate DL RLC Error Rate
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMin attribute. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is lower than 10 except in case of low load in the cell. If the cell load is low, the default value of 1 can be used to improve performance.

## 2.12 Configure an ASG with Static BLER Target for VoLTE UEs

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated, an ASG with static

downlink BLER target can be configured for VoLTE UEs.

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is not applicable to voice services. If the

feature is activated, a static constant BLER target is assigned to all UE sessions

with active voice radio bearers. Dynamic BLER target is assigned to all other UE

sessions.

An ASG with dynamic BLER target deactivated must be configured in the following

cases:

- If at least one ASG is created for MBB traffic with dynamic BLER target activated and the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute set to lower than 100.
- If service-specific BLER target is used.

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Create a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance to define the ASG.
2. Set the qci member of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute to 1.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 10, or a value that is higher than the other ASGs.
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1 to configure a static BLER target of 10%.

## 2.20 Configure Downlink Only Cell

To configure Downlink Only Cell for FDD and TDD cells, do the following:

Steps

1. For Band 29, set the attribute EUtranCellFDD.earfcnul to 0. Value 0 means that the UL channel number is N/A for the downlink only bands. For all other bands, set earfcnul attribute to the applicable band definition in the 3GPP specification.
2. Set the attribute EUtranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth for the downlink only cell to the same value as the dlChannelBandwidth attribute.
3. Lock the cell MO. Note: Some of the following attribute changes require that the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO is locked to take effect or to allow the change. For that reason, it is recommended that the cell MO is locked until the changes are complete.
4. Set the EUtranCellFDD.isDlOnly or EUtranCellTDD.isDlOnly attribute to TRUE for the downlink only cell. Note: Takes effect only after lock/unlock of the cell MO.
5. The SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attribute must be set to 0. The eNodeB assigns the available number of Rx antennas to 0 when the EUtranCellFDD.isDlOnly or EUtranCellTDD.isDlOnly attribute is set to TRUE. Note: Changes only allowed if the cell MO is locked.
6. Set all values for theRfBranch.ulAttenuation attribute and the RfBranch.ulTrafficDelay attribute to -1 for all RfBranches of the downlink only cell indicating that it is not used.
7. Set the EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute for the downlink only cell frequency to -1 to prevent unnecessary mobility measurements.

4. If the inter-cell distance is larger than 300 meters, consider changing the EUtranCellRelation.asmSCellDlOnlyAllowed attribute to DL\_ONLY for the cell relation.

## 2.22 Configure PDCCH enhancement for Carrier Aggregation and VoLTE, FDD Only

If the features ePDCCH LA, VoLTE and CA are enabled, then any configured

SCells are deactivated for the UE when a VoLTE bearer is set up. However,

if attribute CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte is set to TRUE, the following applies

for the SCell:

- The SCell is not deactivated.
- UEs will not receive PDSCH transmissions on the SCell for the subframes from the time interval that a VoLTE packet arrives in the eNodeB and until it departs the eNodeB.

## 2.23 Configure PDCCH Enhancement for TDD

In TDD, the feature Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation is only applicable for UEs that are

configured with HARQ-ACK bundling. Therefore, it is not applicable for UEs configured with

Carrier Aggregation.

More information is found in Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation.

## 2.24 Configure PDCCH Enhancement for FDD-TDD Carrier Aggregation and VoLTE

In FDD-TDD carrier aggregation, when the Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature is enabled and the UE

is configured with a QCI 1 bearer, any configured SCells become deactivated. When the

QCI 1 bearer is removed, the SCells become activated again. The value of the

CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte attribute does

not impact this behavior.

## 2.25 Configure DRX for Connected UE

To configure DRX for Connected UE, do the following:

Steps

1. Install licenses and activate the feature state for Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE and (if used) Service Specific DRX. See Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes for more information.
2. Activate DRX on each cell, see the attribute drxActive in the cell MO class. To deactivate DRX, use the same parameters as when activating DRX.

## 2.26 Activate UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX, FDD Only

To activate UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX, do the

following:

Steps

1. Install licenses and activate the feature state for UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX. See Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
2. Activate UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX on each cell, see the attribute EUtranCellFDD.enableUeAssistedAdaptiveDrx in the cell MO class.
3. Block and unblock the cell.To deactivate the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature, use the same parameters as when activating the feature.

## 2.27 Activate UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction, FDD Only

To activate UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction, do

the following:

Steps

1. Install licenses and activate the feature state for UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction. See Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
2. Activate UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction on each cell, see the attribute EUtranCellFDD.enableUeAssistedSigReduction in the cell MO class.
3. Block and unblock the cell.To deactivate the UE-Assisted Signaling Reduction feature, use the same parameters as when activating the feature.

## 2.28 Configure Adjustable CRS Power

PDSCH type A resource elements are located within a symbol that does not contain reference

signals in the air interface. According to 3GPP TS 36.213, the

crsGain attribute corresponds to

-ρA.

PDSCH type B resource elements are located within a symbol that contains reference signals

in the air interface. According to 3GPP TS 36.213, the

pdschTypeBGain attribute corresponds to

PB or ρB

/ρA.

The value of the EUtranCellFDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute or the

EUtranCellTDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute affects CRS power

boosting when the crsGain attribute is set to 4.77 dB or 6 dB. For more

information, see Table 4.

Table 4   Impact of the adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled Attribute

| Value of the adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled Attribute   | Impact                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| false                                             | If the value of the crsGain attribute is 4.77 dB or 6 dB, it                   is mapped to 3 dB to avoid overallocation of RF signal power. |
| true                                              | Support for boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB is enabled.                                                                                |

To prevent overallocation of RF signal power, the pdschTypeBGain

attribute is remapped to a gain equal to 1 if the following conditions are

fulfilled:

- The crsGain attribute is set to 1.77 dB or 3 dB.
- The adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute is set to false.
- PDSCH Type B gain is 5/4 (pdschTypeBGain is 0).

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.213.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.crsGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.crsGain attribute to adjust CRS power. This configuration sets the downlink power of the cell-specific reference signals relative to a reference level defined by the power of the PDSCH type A resource elements. If crsGain is +3 dB, the power of the reference signal is 3 dB higher than a PDSCH type A resource element.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute to adjust the power of PDSCH Type B. This configuration specifies the power level of PDSCH type B resource elements according to a power gain which is set relatively to resource elements of PDSCH type A.

After This Task

Absolute mobility thresholds might need to be adjusted if reference signal power is

changed.

Power Control

### 2.28.1 Configure CRS Power Boost of 4.77 dB and 6 dB

Boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or 6 dB can be achieved with negligible or no impact on

common channels and PDSCH channels if the radio has sufficient power headroom.

The power headroom of the radio is defined as the difference between the following

characteristics:

- The value of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute
- The radio hardware or license capability

If the radio has insufficient power headroom, boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB or

6 dB causes power loss on common channels and on PDSCH channels.

If the radio has enough power headroom, it is recommended to reconfigure the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. This is to

ensure that boosting CRS power to 4.77 dB and 6 dB is achieved with negligible or no

impact on common channels and PDSCH channels.

Reconfiguring the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower is not needed

when the radio has insufficient power headroom.

Prerequisites

The cell is not part of an ESS cell pair.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.crsGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.crsGain attribute to the value 477 or 600.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute to adjust the power of the PDSCH Type B resource element. The recommended value for the EUtranCellFDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.pdschTypeBGain attribute is 1. It is not recommended to set these attributes to 0 (PDSCH Type B gain is 5/4).
4. Set the EUtranCellFDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.adjustCrsPowerEnhEnabled attribute to true.

If reconfiguration of the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

attribute is needed:

5. Reconfigure the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute according to the following formula: SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower = current\_SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower × factor. For more information on the value of the factor, see Table 5. Table 5 Factor for SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower Reconfiguration Value of crsGain Value of pdschTypeBGain (PDSCH Type Gain) Factor 477 0 (5/4) 1.33 477 1 (4/4) 2 (3/4) 3 (1/2) 1.17 600 0 (5/4) 1.50 600 1 (4/4) 2 (3/4) 3 (1/2) 1.33
6. Unlock the cell.

## 2.29 Configure Distributed Antenna System

The configuration supported by default is the receive/transmit

(RX/TX) duplex configuration. It is possible to connect an antenna

system with separate ports for receive and transmit (simplex reception

and transmission connections) as opposed to the default receive/transmit

duplex connection. This is useful for Distributed Antenna Systems

(DAS), that often have separate ports for transmission and reception.

The

rfPortRef

attribute in the

RfBranch

Managed Object (MO) is affected. The

rfPortRef

attribute points out which port to use on the radio unit. The

SectorEquipmentFunction

MO, referencing the

RfBranch

, must be locked when changing the

rfPortRef

.

The

RfPort

MO with identities RXA\_IO and RXB\_IO represent

the ports labeled RXA I/O and RXB I/O configured as RX ports. The

identities must be set during configuration.

- In the RfPort TOOLTIPFLAG MO, corresponding to the port marked RXA I/O on the radio unit, the parameter RfPortId TOOLTIPFLAG must have the value RXA\_IO. The rfPortRef TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in the corresponding RfBranch TOOLTIPFLAG MO must also have the value RXA\_IO
- In the RfPort TOOLTIPFLAG MO corresponding to the port marked RXB I/O on the radio unit, the parameter RfPortId TOOLTIPFLAG must have the value RXB\_IO The rfPortRef TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in the corresponding RfBranch TOOLTIPFLAG MO must also have the value RXB\_IO

The

RfPort

MO with identities A, B, and so on,

represent the antenna ports, labeled RF A and RF B on the radio unit.

## 2.30 Configure 6 Sector, 7-12 Sector, or 13-18 Sector

It is possible to configure up to 18 sectors per eNodeB with a

single Baseband unit. This reduces the equipment cost and provides

increased coverage. 6 sectors can also be configured with two Baseband

units, resulting in two nodes.

To configure the number of sectors, do the following:

Steps

1. Set the attributes noOfPucchCqiUsers and noOfPucchSrUsers in the cell that is to be configured. The attribute values must comply with the rules described in Control Channel Dimensioning, otherwise the cell setup will be rejected. Note: All cells must be set to administrative state locked before configuring the cells. Once all cells are configured, set administrative state of all cells to unlocked.

## 2.31 Configure Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler

The behavior of Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler is configured

using the following parameters:

- schedulingAlgorithm TOOLTIPFLAG Specifies which scheduling algorithm that must be used for each QCI.
- dlMinBitRate TOOLTIPFLAG This parameter defines the minimum downlink Bit rate which the scheduler will attempt to enforce for users with this QCI.
- ulMinBitRate TOOLTIPFLAG This parameter defines the minimum uplink Bit rate which the scheduler will attempt to enforce for users with this QCI.

Parameter values can be changes without disabling the cell.

More information can be found in Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler and Scheduler.

## 2.32 Configure Security Handling

To configure Security Handling, do the following:

Steps

1. The values of the attributes of the SecurityHandling MO class determine the security handling characteristics of an RBS: cipheringAlgoPrio The attribute determines the priority of the algorithms for ciphering UP data messages and RRC messages. It is possible to set attribute values specifying that some algorithms are not used at all. Setting the value of the cipheringAlgoPrio to EEA0 turns off the UP data and RRC message ciphering. countWrapSupervisionActive The attribute determines if the RBS supervises COUNT-C wrapping, see 3GPP TS 36.331. If the value of the attribute countWrapSupervisionActive is set to true, a new encryption key is generated by releasing and re-establishing the UE connection to the RBS when the supervision function indicates that the COUNT-C is close to its end. This ensures that the same COUNT-C value is never used twice as an encryption input Note: Inappropriate settings may cause significant problems. If the value of the countWrapSupervisionActive attribute is set to false, no COUNT-C supervision is performed. This can result in the same COUNT-C value being used more than once as input for the encryption, which can compromise security. integrityProtectAlgoPrio The attribute determines which of the Integrity Protection Algorithms (ZUC, AES, and SNOW 3G) should be allowed, and their priority order. Note: Inappropriate settings may cause significant problems. It is possible to allow the use of only one of the Integrity Protection Algorithms. However, this may cause failed handover of any UE unable to use the selected Integrity Protection Algorithm.

## 2.33 Configure Conditions for Differentiated Admission Control

Differentiated Admission Control feature covers the basic mechanisms

needed to differentiate admission of connection and bearer requests.

The Differentiated Admission Control feature is controlled by an optional

feature license.

To configure the Differentiated Admission Control feature, do the

following:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
2. Configure the value of AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState.

### 2.33.1 Configure SPID-based Pre-emption

SPID-based pre-emption on each level (early UE pre-emption, UE pre-emption, bearer pre-emption) requires the same configuration.

Prerequisites

- The installed LKF contains the license for Differentiated Admission Control.

Steps

1. Set attribute AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState to ACTIVATED to enable the pre-emption function of Differentiated Admission Control.
2. Set attribute AdmissionControl.diffAdmCtrlFilteringEnabled to true.
3. Create DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile MO instances as desired.
4. Configure attribute DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile.firstPreEmptionSpidSet to define SPIDs with lower priority for pre-emption.
5. Configure attribute EUtranCellFDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef or EUtranCellTDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef to refer to a DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile MO instance created in Step 3.

## 2.34 Configure Emergency Call Prioritization

Steps

1. To activate system resources for privileged access to be used by Emergency Call Prioritization, configure the AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState parameter. Without activating these system resources, there is no Emergency Call Prioritization. For more information, see Admission Control.
2. To activate separate configuration of RBS system resources for HPA and Emergency Call users, activate the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature, and configure the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell and AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attributes. For more information, see Privileged Access Admission Balancing.
3. To reserve cell-level UE resources for PA, activate the Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access feature and configure the EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary78 or the EUtranCellTDD.zzzTemporary78 attribute. For more information, see Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access.
4. To reserve cell-level UE resources for HPA users, activate the Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access feature and configure the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell attribute. For more information, see Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access. Note: The activation of the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature and the configuration of the AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState attribute are not prerequisites for the Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access feature to use the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell attribute.
5. To manage SR resource preallocation for PA in high load situations, configure the AdmissionControl.srBbmPaUsersPreallocation parameter. For more information, see Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users.

## 2.35 Configure PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature requires enabling in cell and configuration

of access class barring parameters.

The PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature introduces the possibility to prioritize

access barring of UEs based on their PLMN during severe system overload. The feature

can adjust access barring automatically as the system overload changes.

Prerequisites

The following features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring

Steps

1. Enable the preferred PLMN-specific access barring functionality. Table 6 PLMN-Specific Access Barring Functionalities Functionality License for Progressive Access Barring License for Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes Attribute EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled PLMN Load-Based Access Barring Deactivated Deactivated N/A PLMN Progressive Access Barring Activated Deactivated false Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring Activated Deactivated true PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes Activated Activated false Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes Activated Activated true
2. Configure the following types of attributes depending on the access barring functionality used. Table 7 Required Configuration for PLMN-Specific Access Barring Access Barring Functionality Configuration PLMN Load-Based Access Barring Common access barring parameters Load-based access barring parameters PLMN-specific access barring parameters PLMN Progressive Access Barring Common access barring parameters Load-based access barring parameters Progressive access barring parameters PLMN-specific access barring parameters Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes Common access barring parameters Load-based access barring parameters Progressive access barring parameters Progressive access barring parameters for special access classes PLMN-specific access barring parameters Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes For more information, see PLMN-Specific Access Barring.

## 2.36 Configure Transport Network Admission Control

The admission thresholds for non-privileged access GBR traffic can be configured for

transport network resources. To configure Transport Network Admission Control do the

following:

Steps

1. Configure the transport network bandwidth using the AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth and AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth parameters.
2. Define the admission thresholds using the AdmissionControl.dlNonPaGbrTn and AdmissionControl.ulNonPaGbrTn parameters, see Admission Control. The admission thresholds for non-privileged GBR admission are dlTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps × (dlNonPaGbrTn / 1000) for downlink and ulTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps × (ulNonPaGbrTn / 1000) for uplink. Thus it is possible to adjust the size of the transport network bandwidth, which is reserved for the GBR part. The remaining bandwidth is for the non-GBR part. If the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is activated, the reserving of GBR resources can be adjusted for each QCI using the QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciAcTuning parameter. The admission thresholds for privileged access GBR traffic are dlTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps for downlink and ulTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps for uplink.

## 2.37 Configure Positioning, Activation and License

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- A license key must be activated to operate OTDOA support in Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) feature. See Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
- Set otdoaSuplActive TOOLTIPFLAG to ACTIVATED or DEACTIVATED per cell.

## 2.38 Configure Positioning, PRS

There are two ways of configuring PRS. The preferred way guarantees

non-collisions between PRS and SIB1 subframes:

- Configure PRS by setting the parameter prsPeriod TOOLTIPFLAG. Periodicity of the PRS transmissions. The value of prsPeriod together with a fixed value for PRS subframe offset, is used by the eNodeB to calculate the read-only prsConfigIndexMapped TOOLTIPFLAG parameter.

The alternative way gives full flexibility, but collisions between

PRS and SIB1 subframes may occur:

- Configure PRS by setting the parameters prsConfigIndex TOOLTIPFLAG and NoConsecutivePrsSubframes TOOLTIPFLAG.
- prsConfigIndex TOOLTIPFLAG The Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) index value for the cell defines the periodicity of the PRS transmissions and the PRS subframe offset as defined in 3GPP TS 36.211. The value is copied by the eNodeB to the read-only prsConfigIndexMapped TOOLTIPFLAG parameter. Note: prsConfigIndex TOOLTIPFLAG must be set to a value which avoids collision between the PRS subframe and SIB1, otherwise the eNodeB will respond with a cell setup reject.
- prsEnabled TOOLTIPFLAG If this attribute is set to TRUE, the PRS will be sent from this SectorCarrier TOOLTIPFLAG MO. If only one sector carrier is configured in the cell, the parameter must be set to true.

Configure PRS for improved positioning accuracy by setting the

following attributes in the cell MO:

- prsTransmisScheme This parameter allows selecting either antenna switching or pre-coder switching for the PRS transmission.
- prsPowerBoosting This parameter allows the selection of different power boosting alternatives for PRS transmissions.
- prsMutingPatternLen This parameter allows the selection of the length in number of bits of the PRS muting pattern.
- prsMutingPattern This parameter is a bit string. It stores the muting pattern in use.

## 2.39 Configure Positioning, Cell Geographical Information

The cell geographical information is defined by the following attributes

in the

EUtranCellFDD

or

EUtranCellTDD

MO:

- latitude The degree of latitude of the transmitter antenna position. In case of a combined cell: If all sector carriers in a combined cell have the same output power, for example in indoor scenario or 3-sector site scenario, it is assumed that the antennas of different sector carriers are located close to each other, therefore the position parameter is set using any of the antennas position. If there is one macro sector that has the highest power, the position parameter is set using the antenna position of the macro sector.
- longitude The degree of longitude of the transmitter antenna position. In case of a combined cell: If all sector carriers in a combined cell have the same output power, for example in indoor scenario or 3-sector site scenario, it is assumed that the antennas of different sector carriers are located close to each other, therefore the position parameter is set using any of the antennas position. If there is one macro sector that has the highest power, the position parameter is set using the antenna position of the macro sector.
- altitude The altitude of the transmitter antenna in meters. In case of a combined cell: If all sector carriers in a combined cell have the same output power, for example in indoor scenario or 3-sector site scenario, it is assumed that the antennas of different sector carriers are located close to each other, therefore the position parameter is set using any of the antennas position. If there is one macro sector that has the highest power, the position parameter is set using the antenna position of the macro sector.
- uncertSemiMajor Semi major axis of uncertainty.
- uncertSemiMinor Semi minor axis of uncertainty.
- orientMajorAxis The orientation of major axis of uncertainty, in degrees clockwise from north.
- uncertAltitude The uncertainty altitude.
- confidence Set to define the percentage of confidence that the target is within the ellipsoid parameters defined by the uncertSemiMajor and uncertAltitude parameters.
- eutranCellCoverage Models the cell coverage area used for UE positioning. The cell coverage area is defined by the cell bearing, cell opening angle, and cell radius.
- eutranCellPolygon Models the manageable characteristics for the cell polygon used for UE positioning.

## 2.40 Configure Service Specific DRX

The Service Specific Discontinuous Reception (DRX) feature makes

it possible for different services have different DRX settings to

save UE battery without sacrificing system performance. There is only

one DRX profile table for an eNodeB that is applied for all cells

belonging to the node.

The features Service Specific DRX and Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected

UE must be installed and activated to use Service Specific DRX. More

information on these features can be found in Service Specific DRX and Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE

Steps

If the feature Service Specific DRX is used, the following

procedure must be performed for all QCIs in the eNodeB:

1. Lock all cells in the eNodeB.
2. Define the DRX profile associated with the QCI using: The parameter drxProfileRef TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is predefined. The parameter drxProfileRef TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is operator-defined.
3. Set relative priority among the DRX profiles using:. The parameter drxPriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is predefined. The parameter drxPriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is operator-defined. Note: Larger drxPriority values indicate higher relative priority. The drxPriority has to be unique across all the configured QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG and QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MOC instances except for instances where the drxProfileId is the same. That is, instances that share the same drxProfileId may have the same drxPriority value.
4. Unlock the cells. Updates take effect when the first cell is unlocked. Note: UEs connected to the cells that were not locked/unlocked during modification of the DRX profile are likely to be lost due to inconsistent DRX configuration. Once these UEs are reconnected, or UEs are newly connected to the eNodeB, the new DRX configuration will be applied to them.

## 2.41 Configure Relative Priority Scheduling for PFS

Relative Priority is only used if the licenses for the features

QoS-Aware Scheduler, Proportional Fair Scheduler and Relative Priority

Scheduling are installed and activated. More information about the

feature can be found in Relative Priority Scheduling.

The relative priority is applicable for rate based scheduler algorithms

(EQUAL\_RATE), PROPORTIONAL\_FAIR\_HIGH, PROPORTIONAL\_FAIR\_MEDIUM, and PROPORTIONAL\_FAIR\_LOW configured in

SchedulingAlgorithm

).

Steps

1. Configure relative priority for each QCI using the following parameters: relativePriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class for each predefined QCI. If not manually configured, the default value will remain in effect. relativePriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class for each operator defined QCI. If not manually configured, the default value will remain in effect. Note: The average bearer bitrate quotient between bearers with similar radio conditions corresponds to the relative priority quotient between these bearers. A high value for the attribute relativePriority corresponds to increased bitrate to the QCI.

## 2.42 Configure Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair

Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair is only used if the

license for the feature QoS-Aware Scheduler is installed and activated.

More information about the feature can be found in Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling.

The relative priority is applicable to the time-since-last-scheduled

algorithm used for Resource Fair scheduling.

If not manually configured, the default value will remain in effect. relativePriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class for each operator defined QCI. If not manually configured, the default value will remain in effect.

## 2.43 Configure Uplink Frequency Selective Scheduling

Steps

1. To configure conditions for Uplink Frequency Selective Scheduling, use the following parameter in the QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG or QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class. resourceAllocationStrategy TOOLTIPFLAG

## 2.44 Configure RRC Timers Per QCI

If the function RRC Timers per QCI is used, the following procedure must be

performed for the specific QCI in the eNodeB:

Steps

1. Create a TimerProfile MO and set timer values.
2. Define the Timer profile associated with the QCI using:
    1. The parameter timeProfileRef in the QciProfilePredefined MO class if the QCI is predefined.
    2. The parameter timerProfileRef in the QciProfileOperatorDefined MO class if the QCI is operator-defined.
3. Note: Higher timerPriority values indicate higher relative priority. Set relative priority among the Timer profiles using:
    1. The parameter timerPriority in the QciProfilePredefined MO class if the QCI is predefined.
    2. The parameter timerPriority in the QciProfileOperatorDefined MO class if the QCI is operator-defined.

## 2.45 Configure RLF Timer Per QCI

The Radio Link Failure (RLF) Timer Per QCI function makes it possible

for the operator to configure timers and constants parameters per

QCI. The RLF configuration is sent to the UE in dedicated messages.

The function makes it possible to have different settings for voice,

data, and other services.

The function supports different RLF configurations (timers and

constants) per QCI and the RLF configuration settings is sent in dedicated

message (RRCConnectionReconfiguration, RRCConnectionReestablishment) to the UE. The total

number of RLF configuration is 19 and the feature is used on eNodeB

level.

When the RLF configuration is valid the rlf-TimersAndConstants parameter will be included during E-RAB Setup/Modify/Release, Handover

(S1 and X2), and at InitialContextSetup message. The RLF configuration

is only applicable for UEs from release 9 and higher.

The related MO parameters for the feature are:

MO attributes for timers:

- RlfProfile.t301 TOOLTIPFLAG
- RlfProfile.t310 TOOLTIPFLAG
- RlfProfile.t311 TOOLTIPFLAG

MO attributes for constants:

- RlfProfile.n310 TOOLTIPFLAG
- RlfProfile.n311 TOOLTIPFLAG

MO attributes for RLF definitions per QCI profile:

- QciProfilePredefined.rlfPriority TOOLTIPFLAG
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlfPriority TOOLTIPFLAG
- QciProfilePredefined.rlfProfileRef TOOLTIPFLAG
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlfProfileRef TOOLTIPFLAG

If the feature RLF Timer Per QCI is used, the following procedure

must be performed for the specific QCI in the eNodeB:

Steps

1. Create an RlfProfile MO and set timers and constants
2. Define the RLF profile associated with the QCI using: The parameter rlfProfileRef TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is predefined. The parameter rlfProfileRef TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is operator-defined.
3. Set relative priority among the RLF profiles using: The parameter rlfPriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfilePredefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is predefined. The parameter rlfPriority TOOLTIPFLAG in the QciProfileOperatorDefined TOOLTIPFLAG MO class if the QCI is operator-defined. Note: Higher rlfPriority values indicate higher relative priority. The rlfPriority should be preferably unique across all the configured QciProfilePredefined and QciProfileOperatorDefined MOC instances except for instances where the rlfProfileId is the same. That is, instances that share the same rlfProfileId may have the same rlfPriority value. When there exist several RLF configuration on QCIs with the same highest value of rlfPriority, the lowest QCI will be selected. Where the rlfPriority value is unique and the UE uses different RlfProfile per QCI the RlfProfile with the highest rlfPriority will be selected.

## 2.66 Configure Prescheduling

Prescheduling is a licensed feature that minimizes the round-trip

time. It gives Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) grants to UEs

in advance, that is, without receiving scheduling requests or buffer

status reports.

To configure Prescheduling, do the following:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.

More information can be found in Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes and Prescheduling. Note: More information about configuring VoLTE Prescheduling can be found in VoLTE Prescheduling.

## 2.67 Configure Paging

This section covers configuration of paging functionality. The

values of the attributes of the

Paging

MO class determine the

paging characteristics.

- defaultPagingCycle Paging cycle (T). Used by RBS and broadcast in system information type 2. Default range is {32-256} subframes. UE-specific DRX cycle overrides defaultPagingCycle if UE-specific DRX cycle is provided in S1AP paging. If extended Idle Mode DRX feature is active, the UE specific paging cycle can be extended up to 262144 radio frames.
- defaultPagingCycleNbIot Paging cycle (T) is used by RBS and broadcast in system information type 2. Its default range is {256-1024} subframes. UE-specific DRX cycle overrides defaultPagingCycle if UE-specific DRX cycle is provided in S1AP paging. If extended Idle Mode DRX feature is active, the UE specific paging cycle can be extended up to 262144 radio frames.
- maxNoOfPagingRecords The number of UEs paged in a paging occasion can not exceed the number specified by the value of the maxNoOfPagingRecords attribute. If the received number of Paging messages from MME, targeting the same paging occasion, exceeds maxNoOfPagingRecords , the excess paging records are sent in the next paging occasion in the paging cycle. Hence setting this parameter to a smaller value may cause extra delays for some Paging messages, but instead it limits the bandwidth used by paging. A larger value may require more of the RBS bandwidth but decreases the probability of extra delays for UEs.
- nB The value of the attribute determines the number of paging occasions in each paging frame. Together with the attribute defaultPagingCycle it determines the paging time and the distribution of the Paging traffic in time. Setting the value of the nB attribute so that there are fewer paging occasions in each paging frame will decrease the total number of available paging occasions and hence the Paging traffic will be more "bursty".
- pagingDiscardTimer The attribute determines the maximum period of time a received Paging may be retained or queued in the RBS before it is discarded. The value of the pagingDiscardTimer should be the same as that set in the paging resend timer in the MME. Setting the attribute value too high will result in the RBS paging queue containing several instances of the same paging sent by the MME. Setting the value of the pagingDiscardTimer attribute too low will remove some paging messages from the RBS paging queue prematurely. This will result in unnecessary paging resend from the MME.

## 2.68 Configure Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs

This licensed feature improves system performance by limiting resources

to unreachable UEs. It identifies scheduling resources allocated to

out-of-coverage UEs and releases them for reallocation.

To configure Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-of-Coverage UEs

do the following:

- To activate the feature state, install the license and an MO instance UlSchedContlForOocUes is automatically created.

This parameter is valid for the MO class EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulSchedCtrlForOocUesEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.ulSchedCtrlForOocUesEnabled, enables the feature Uplink Scheduling Control for Out-Of-Coverage UEs.

For more information refer to Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes and Uplink Scheduling Control

for Out-of-Coverage UEs.

## 2.69 Configure Multi-Clustered PUSCH

To configure Multi-Clustered PUSCH, do the following:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes .
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.maxNoClusteredPuschAlloc TOOLTIPFLAG attribute to larger than 0.
3. Lock or unlock the cell with featureState = ACTIVATED.
4. Optionally for tuning purposes, set the EUtranCellFDD.clusteredPuschMprFactor TOOLTIPFLAG attribute. More information can be found in Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes and Multi-Clustered PUSCH.

## 2.70 Configure Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission

This licensed feature uses an updated algorithm

on two existing MOM configuration parameters, in the MO classes SignalingRadioBearer and

DataRadioBearer:

- dlMaxRetxThreshold
- tPollRetransmitDl

To configure Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes .
2. Set the attribute dlMaxRetxThreshold to specify the number of poll-retransmission attempts before declaring RLF on downlink, and set tPollRetransmitDl for the default poll interval.

Results

The updated algorithm uses tPollRetransmitDl as a starting point

for calculating the poll-retransmission interval on SRBs and DRBs in downlink. It

checks the current ARQ Round Trip Time (RTT) and gradually increases the poll

interval up to a maximum of 500ms.

This reduces poll-retransmissions on SRBs and DRBs in downlink and extends the time

to declare Radio Link Failure (RLF) on downlink (DL) without impacting poll behavior

for other UEs.

For more information, see License Management and the feature

description Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission.

## 2.71 Configure Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation, FDD Only

This FDD-only feature increases downlink-throughput by limiting the cell-specific

reference signal (CRS) interference. It facilitates manual configuration of the CRS

assistance information of neighbor-cells: the eNodeB provides this information to

the UEs so that they can limit the CRS interference.

To configure Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation:

Steps

## 2.72 Configure Dynamic PUCCH, FDD Only

This licensed feature is used to dynamically allocate and deallocate PUCCH PRB pairs so

that more PRB resources are available for PUSCH, compared to the static PUCCH

dimensioning.

The license and feature activations are done on node level.

The following applies:

- If the feature is enabled, the new PUCCH layout is always applied in cells after cell lock/unlock.
- If the feature is disabled, the new PUCCH layout is not applied in cells after cell lock/unlock.

It is possible to enable or disable the dynamic expansion or dynamic contraction

functionality per cell. When the attribute allocThrPucchFormat1 in MO class EUtranCellFDD is set to 0, it means that the dynamic PUCCH

allocation or deallocation operation is disabled. It can be reset with a value larger

than 0. When it becomes disabled, the number of PUCCH PRBs is fixed in current state.

The feature is designed to work with the feature Minimum Rate Proportional Fair

Scheduler enabled.

The feature will work with all settings on

QciProfilePredefined.schedulingAlgorithm

(but no differentiation in

MAXIMUM\_C\_OVER\_I due to the nature of the algorithm).

Setting

QciProfilePredefined.ulMinBitRate

to NOT zero will affect the differentiation ratio between the relative

priorities for the proportional fair scheduling algorithms (see Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler).

## 2.82 Configure Category M Access

To configure Category M Access, do the following:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes and Category M Access.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.catm1SupportEnabled attribute to true.

    - Set the EUtranCellTDD.nonCaAnModeMuxEnable attribute to true to enable TDD HARQ-ACK multiplexing support. The changes take effect immediately, locking and unlocking the cell is not required.
    - Set the EUtranCellTDD.nonCaAnModeF3Enableattribute to true to enable TDD PUCCH format 3 support. Lock and unlock the cell for the changes to take effect.

## 2.84 Configure an Operating Bandwidth of a Standard LTE Carrier Bandwidth

The configuration of the operating bandwidth of a standard LTE carrier involves

several steps including blocking the scheduler usage of edge PRBs and configuring

the radio operating carrier bandwidth.

The configuration of the 7.5-MHz bandwidth is introduced by the ICB7.5 licensed

feature. This feature is supported for NB-IoT in-band and guard band deployment

modes with the following configuration requirements:

- For in-band deployment mode, only 37 PRBs on the low edge can be configured on both downlink and uplink.
- The guard band deployment mode supports only the one carrier configuration. This carrier can be configured only on the low edge.
- To avoid performance degradation, the following attributes need to be configured with supported settings provided in Flexible Channel Bandwidth: dlConfigurableFrequencyStart dlFrequencyAllocationProportion ulConfigurableFrequencyStart ulFrequencyAllocationProportion

If the ICB7.5 feature is configured for a cell, then eMBMS, ESS and Radio Gateway

cannot be added to this cell.

Steps

1. Configure the carrier as usual.
2. Activate the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature.
3. Configure the scheduler to block uplink PRBs at carrier edge: Table 10 MOM Attribute Values LTE Standard Carrier Alternative Operating Bandwidth MOM Attribute Values pucchOverdimensioning ulInterferenceManagementActive ulConfigurableFrequencyStart ulFrequencyAllocationProportion 5 MHz 4.2 MHz 2 false 22 80 4.4 MHz 1 false 14 88 4.6 MHz 1 false 14 88 4.8 MHz 1 false 14 88 10 MHz 7.5 MHz 13 false 0 74 8.8 MHz(1) 8 false 0 84 8.8 MHz(2) 6 false 13 88 9 MHz 1 false 7 94 (1) High-edge configuration (2) Low-edge configuration
4. Configure the scheduler to block downlink PRBs at carrier edge: Table 11 MOM Attribute Values LTE Standard Carrier Alternative Operating Bandwidth MOM Attribute Values dlInterferenceManagementActive dlConfigurableFrequencyStart dlFrequencyAllocationProportion 5 MHz 4.2 MHz false N/A 80 4.4 MHz false N/A 88 4.6 MHz false N/A 88 4.8 MHz false N/A 88 10 MHz 7.5 MHz false 0 74 8.8 MHz(1) false 0 84 8.8 MHz(2) false 13 88 9 MHz false 7 94
5.

## 2.85 Configure Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling

Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling improves uplink UE throughput

and PRB resource utilization for large-buffer UEs with good channel conditions,

identified as data-aware UEs. This also increases uplink average UE throughput and

uplink cell throughput. This is achieved by ensuring that data-aware UEs are scheduled

more frequently, and are allocated more radio resources than by the basic Scheduler

function.

This licensed feature supports both TDD and FDD. It can be enabled or disabled at cell

level.

To configure the feature, do the following:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
2. Enable or disable Data-Aware Uplink Scheduling by setting the number of data-aware UEs that can be candidates to get improved radio resources. This is handled by MOM attribute noOfUlImprovedUe in MO Class EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD. Note: The feature is enabled at activation, with the attribute noOfUlImprovedUe automatically set to 1.
3. Set the MOM attribute bsrThreshold in MO Class EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD. The attribute bsrThreshold is used to identify data-aware UEs.
4. Enable or disable the function of forcing data-aware UEs to be scheduled last in PUSCH resource allocation using the MOM attribute ulImprovedUeSchedLastEnabled in MO Class EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD. Note: The function is enabled by default.

## 2.86 Configure Service-Specific HARQ

Service-Specific HARQ is a licensed feature that allows setting the HARQ priority for

each QCI and increasing the maximum number of HARQ transmissions (maxHARQTx) per

QCI.

To configure the feature, do the following:

Steps

1. Install the license and activate the feature state, see Service-Specific HARQ.
2. Disable or enable the Service-Specific HARQ on cell level using EUtranCellFDD.enableServiceSpecificHARQ or EUtranCellTDD.enableServiceSpecificHARQ.
3. Set the HARQ priority value for a specific QCI with QciProfilePredefined.harqPriority or QciProfileOperatorDefined.harqPriority.
4. Set the maxHARQTx for the same specific QCI using QciProfilePredefined.dlMaxHARQTx and QciProfilePredefined.ulMaxHARQTx or QciProfileOperatorDefined.dlMaxHARQTx and QciProfileOperatorDefined.ulMaxHARQTx. Note: The maxHARQTx value of the QCI profile with the highest HARQ priority is used for every UE bearer.
5. Use EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration orEUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration to enable automatic configuration of tReorderingDl and tReorderingUl.

Results

By enabling DRX Aware RLC ARQ, the t-PollretransmitTimer

automatically adapts to the time that HARQ procedure and

harqOffset require.

If the Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature is activated, it dynamically

increases the poll interval.

## 2.87 Enable Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

The operator can configure up to three LAA SCells in one sector on Band 46 using

dynamic channel selection.

Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the regulatory requirements for radio use in the unlicensed 5-GHz band in the region or country where the system is installed. For example, available frequency bands, maximum allowed transmission time, or transmit power.
- The license key is installed on the node.
- Prerequisite features are activated.
- Conflicting features are disabled or deactivated.
- Disable MBMS for LAA SCells so no MbsfnAreaCellRelation.mbsfnAreaCellRef instance is created which refers to an LAA SCell.
- Using the MOM structure involving the Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access cell is not allowed. This ensures the following: Handover to SCell is not allowed. Load balancing is disabled. Mobility measurements are not allowed. Mobility for a voice session is prevented. ANR does not perform measurements on LAA frequencies. This prevents the eNodeB from creating downlink only cell relations.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the EUtranCellTDD.isDlOnly and EUtranCellTDD.isLaa attribute to true.
3. The SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attribute must be set to 1 or 2 in accordance with Radio 2205 limitations. For Radio 2205 supporting LAA cells, only one Rx antenna is used to perform listen-before-talk measurements if SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas is set to 1. Note: Changes only allowed if the cell MO is locked.
4. Create an UnlicensedAccessFunction MO instance.
5. Set the UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaChannelSelectionType attribute to DYNAMIC\_CHANNEL\_SELECTION.
6. Create an UnlicensedBandProfile MO instance.
    - Set the members in the UnlicensedBandProfile.unlicensedBandProfileList attribute according to regulatory requirements and go to Step Step 7. Perform the steps for each LAA SCell to configure different channels. When all channels are configured, go to Step 10.
    - Create a SectorEquipmentFunction MO instance and go to Step 10.
7. Create an EUtranFreqRelationUnlicensed MO instance with reference to the UnlicensedBandProfile MO.
8. Create an EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed MO instance.
9. Set the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.earfcn attribute to the value that corresponds with the chosen channel. Example Attribute values to configure channel EARFCN 51090. Attribute Attribute Member Value UnlicensedBandProfile.unlicensedBandProfileList channelCharacteristic CHANNEL\_ENABLED maxUnlicensedTxPower 74 unlicensedBand BAND\_46C unlicensedEarfcn EARFCN\_51090 EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.earfcn N/A 51090
10. Unlock the cell.
11. Check that there are no alarms.

3. Set the MO attribute sCellHandlingAtVolteCall in the MO class EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD to DECONF\_SCELLS, DECONF\_UL\_SUPPRESS\_DL\_SCELLS or DECONF\_UL\_SCELLS.

## 2.89 Configure Load-Based CA SCell Handling

The Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature allows prioritization of cell resources for

RRC connected users in case of high load. UEs using the cell through CA as SCell are

blocked in case of high load, so RRC connected users can utilize the full spectrum

of the cell resources.

The load is measured with five traffic load indicators. All five traffic load

indicators have a high and a low threshold. The thresholds can be configured for

each cell.

To configure Load-Based CA SCell Handling:

Prerequisites

achieved.

Prerequisites

The 256-QAM Uplink feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.ul256qamEnabled attribute to true.
2. Lock the cell.
3. Unlock the cell.

To achieve optimal 256-QAM uplink transmission:

4. Tune the EUtranCellFDD.pZeroNominalPusch and EUtranCellFDD.puschPwrOffset256qam attributes to achieve the following SINR values: Uplink Transmission SINR Value Enabling 256-QAM (MCS 23 or above) 20 dB Maximum MCS 26 dB Peak throughput 28 dB The SINR value is determined by the following equation: SINR = PSDRX - IpN The following parameters are used in the equation: PSDRX EUtranCellFDD.pZeroNominalPusch + EUtranCellFDD.puschPwrOffset256qam when the EUtranCellFDD.alpha attribute is set to 1 IpN Interference + noise for each PRB

## 2.92 Configure LTE Flexible Power Boost for Initial Access

The values of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch attributes depend on the

following aspects:

- The cell bandwidth
- The PHICH resource
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchCfiMode or the EUtranCellTDD.pdcchCfiMode attribute

Table 14 shows the recommended maximum settings

of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch or the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch attributes.

Table 14   Recommended Maximum Settings (Unit: 0.1 dB)

|   CFI | 1.4 MHz   | 3 MHz   | 5 MHz   |   10 MHz |   15 MHz |   20 MHz |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
|     1 | N/A       | N/A     | N/A     |        0 |       15 |       30 |
|     2 | N/A       | 0       | 0       |       30 |       30 |       30 |
|     3 | N/A       | 0       | 25(1)   |       30 |       30 |       30 |

(1)

The maximum setting of the

EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch

and the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch

attributes for 5MHz and CFI 3 can be 30.

It is recommended to set the same value for the maximum setting of the

EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch attributes as the maximum

setting for the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch

attribute and the value of the EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch

attribute.

Setting the values of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch or the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch attributes too high might lead

to insufficient resources and random access failure which might result in Msg2

transmission failure.

## 2.93 Configure Mobility Delay for Robust Call Setup

The establishment of a QCI1 bearer for a VoLTE call can be prioritized by delaying

handover and RwR procedures when an attempt for VoLTE call setup is detected through IMS or

RRC signaling.

The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature delays handover, RwR,

and EN-DC procedures to prioritize the establishment of the QCI1 bearer for the

VoLTE call. Depending on the priorities in the network, the following attributes can

be used to configure the detection method and the mobility procedures delayed by the

feature:

- RobustCallSetup.imsSignalingDetectionEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.moVoiceDetectionEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled

For more information, see LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup.

Prerequisites

The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the value of the RobustCallSetup.imsSignalingDetectionEnabled attribute to true to enable the detection of IMS signaling on the QCI5 bearer. Result: The feature initiates the mobility delay procedure when SIP signaling is detected on the QCI5 bearer.
2. Set the value of the RobustCallSetup.moVoiceDetectionEnabled attribute to true to enable the detection of mobile-originating voice requests. Result: The feature initiates the mobility delay procedure when it detects an attempt at mobile-originating VoLTE call setup that is initiated by the reception of the establishmentCause IE defined as mo-VoiceCall-v1280 or emergency in the RRCConnectionRequest message.
3. Set the value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute to the default value of true to allow blind mobility actions when the UE is in poor coverage in the outer search zone or the critical zone. In downlink, if the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated, the feature works in the following way: The mobility delay is not initiated for detected attempts for VoLTE call setup if the UE is in the outer search zone or in the critical zone. Ongoing mobility delay is interrupted when an A2 Critical measurement report is received, allowing the blind mobility procedure to start immediately. In uplink, if the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature is activated, the feature interrupts the ongoing mobility delay when an A2 UL Critical Coverage measurement report is received, allowing the blind mobility procedure to start immediately.
4. Configure the procedures to be delayed. Table 15 Mobility Delay Configuration Parameter Default Parameter Setting Affected Measurement Report Affected Procedure Mobility Delay RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled true B1, B2 IRAT handover or RwR to GSM and WCDMA The feature discards incoming B1 and B2 measurement reports that trigger mobility procedures to GSM and WCDMA. RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Blind IRAT handover or RwR to GSM and WCDMA The feature blocks blind mobility procedures to GSM and WCDMA that are triggered by the reception of an A2 measurement report. RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage Blind IRAT handover or RwR to GSM and WCDMA If the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to false, the feature blocks blind mobility procedures to GSM and WCDMA that are triggered by the reception of the following measurement reports: A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled true B1, B2 IRAT handover or RwR to NR The feature discards incoming B1 and B2 measurement reports that trigger mobility procedures to NR. RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Blind IRAT handover or RwR to NR The feature blocks blind mobility procedures to NR that are triggered by the reception of an A2 measurement report. RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage Blind IRAT handover or RwR to NR If the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to false, the feature blocks blind mobility procedures to NR that are triggered by the reception of the following measurement reports: A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled true A3, A5 Intra-LTE inter-frequency or intra-frequency handover or RwR The feature discards incoming A3 and A5 measurement reports that trigger intra-LTE inter-frequency or intra-frequency mobility procedures. RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Blind intra-LTE handover or RwR The feature blocks blind intra-LTE mobility procedures that are triggered by the reception of an A2 measurement report. RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage Blind intra-LTE handover or RwR If the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to false, the feature blocks blind intra-LTE mobility procedures that are triggered by the reception of the following measurement reports: A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled true B1 EN-DC Secondary Node Addition, Secondary Cell Group Addition The feature discards incoming B1 measurement reports that trigger the EN-DC Secondary Node Addition and the Secondary Cell Group Addition procedures. If the value of this attribute and the ENodeBFunction.endcS1OverlapMode attribute is set to true, QCI1 establishment requests are delayed until the ongoing EN-DC procedure is completed.
