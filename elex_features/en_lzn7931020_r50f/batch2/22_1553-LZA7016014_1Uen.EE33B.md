## 1.1 Mobility Overview

UE mobility support in LTE is provided for connected mode and idle mode.

Idle mode mobility refers to the case when the UE does not have a signaling connection

present in the serving cell. In idle mode the UE-state is RRC\_IDLE.

Connected mode mobility functions maintain sessions as UE moves between cells. In connected

mode the UE has a signaling connection present in the serving cell. The corresponding UE state

is RRC\_CONNECTED.

The main RRC\_CONNECTED mode mobility categories include:

- Intra-frequency handover where the UE remains in connected mode on the current carrier frequency in the LTE network.
- Inter-frequency handover where the UE remains in connected mode while transferring to a cell on another carrier frequency in the LTE network.
- Coverage-triggered session continuity where the eNodeB releases the UE and directs it to another carrier frequency: either an Inter-Radio Access Technology (IRAT) frequency or another LTE frequency.
- Coverage-triggered session continuity where the eNodeB directs the UE to another Inter-Radio Access Technology (IRAT) frequency
- Coverage-triggered IRAT handover where the eNodeB directs the UE to a cell of another RAT after negotiation with the other network

Figure 1 shows various types of handovers within an LTE

network.

Figure 1   Types of Handovers

## 1.2 Handovers

The eNodeB can perform handover to other E-UTRAN frequencies, and to the following

networks:

- CDMA
- GSM
- WCDMA
- NR SA

The following handover types exist:

| Intra-LTE   |    | Handover within the current nodes (Intra-MME and Intra-SGW).   |
|-------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|             |    |                                                                |
| Inter-LTE   |    | Handover toward other LTE nodes (Inter-MME and Inter-SGW).     |
|             |    |                                                                |
| Inter-RAT   |    | Handover toward a different Radio Access Technology (RAT).     |

The following features control handover operations:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Handover
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Handover
- LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Handover
- Outgoing NR IRAT Handover
- SRVCC Handover to GERAN
- SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

Before configuring inter-RAT handover, a coexisting network must be

configured in the eNodeB. See Manage Radio Network.

The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature improves the functionality of the following features to increase the flexibility of mobility handling at poor coverage:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Handover
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Handover

It introduces a search zone along the edge of the cell, where UE measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells.

The Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature enhances mobility by introducing uplink channel quality. It is measured in the eNodeB as SINR. It is an addition to the quantities measured on the downlink channel. This improves the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature and the functionality of the following features to increase mobility handling flexibility at poor uplink channel coverage:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Handover
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Handover

The feature also introduces an uplink search zone along the edge of

the cell, where UE measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells. If a

frequency or cell is detected, a mobility action is initiated.

The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature enables UE handover from the LTE network to the NR

network when the UE measures good coverage in an NR frequency. In this case, the data session

is maintained. Direct packet forwarding is supported for the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover

feature.

## 1.3 Session Continuity

LTE can direct sessions to other E-UTRAN frequencies and to CDMA, GSM, WCDMA, and NR

networks.

The following features control coverage-triggered session continuity:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity

Additionally, NR Coverage Triggered NR Session Continuity feature controls session continuity

triggered when UE measures good coverage on NR frequency.

Before configuring coverage-triggered session continuity, a coexisting network must be

configured in the eNodeB, see Manage Radio Network.

The feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage improves the functionality of the

Coverage-Triggered features to increase the flexibility of mobility handling at poor coverage.

It introduces a search zone along the edge of the cell, where UE measurements will search for

alternative frequencies and cells.

The Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature enhances mobility by introducing uplink channel quality. It is measured in the eNodeB as SINR. It is an addition to the quantities measured on the downlink channel. This improves the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature and the functionality of the following features to increase mobility handling flexibility at poor uplink channel coverage:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Handover
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Handover

## 1.4 Traffic Load Balancing

The purpose of traffic load balancing is to manage uneven distribution

of traffic load between cells. It is possible to distribute the overload

between different E-UTRAN frequencies, or configured sets of UTRAN

FDD cells with added capacity.

The following features control traffic load balancing:

- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- IFLB Activation Threshold
- Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA
- Inter-Frequency Offload
- Automated Cell Capacity Estimation
- Coverage-Adapted Load Management
- Admission-Triggered Offload

More information about cell configuration is found in Manage Radio Network.

## 1.5 UE Measurements

When a UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED mode, the eNodeB configures the UE to detect the signal quality

in the serving cell and in surrounding cells. Certain conditions are defined as named events.

UE reports the quality to the eNodeB through event-triggered measurement reports. Table 1 shows events and mobility functions

initiated by event-triggered measurement reports.

Table 1   Connected Mode UE Measurements

| Event          | Event Condition                                                                                                                                | Initiates Mobility Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

All attributes that control the UE measurement behavior can be found in the

MO class. These attributes have default values that provide UE measurement functionality. In

order to optimize network performance, the operator can change the attributes.

Measurement reports related to the Automated Neighbor Relations (ANR) feature is described in

Manage Automated Neighbor Relations.

Measurement reports and equations are described further in 3GPP TS

36.331.

### 1.5.1 A1 Measurement

A1 measurement implies that a bad coverage condition ceases,

that is, the serving cell coverage becomes better than a threshold.

Preparations for inter-frequency handover and session continuity are

stopped when this event is triggered. Table 2 lists MO classes used to configure A1 measurements.

Table 2   A1 Measurement Configuration MOs

| Measurement Type            | MO Class                                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Primary A1 UE measurement   | ReportConfigA1Prim                 TOOLTIPFLAG |
| Secondary A1 UE measurement | ReportConfigA1Sec                 TOOLTIPFLAG  |

Primary and secondary reporting refer to the option to use different

settings for two simultaneous measurements.

### 1.5.2 A2 Measurement

Poor coverage behavior is handled by A2 measurements. A2 measurement is triggered when the

serving cell becomes worse than threshold. The following mobility actions are initiated by A2

measurement:

- Inter-frequency handover
- Coverage triggered IRAT handover
- Coverage-triggered session continuity

Table Table 3 lists MO classes used

to configure A2 measurements.

Table 3   A2 Measurement Configuration MOs

| Measurement Type            | MO Class                                                |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary A2 UE measurement   | ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim                 TOOLTIPFLAG |
| Secondary A2 UE measurement | ReportConfigEUtraBadCovSec                 TOOLTIPFLAG  |
| A2 Search measurement       | ReportConfigSearch                 TOOLTIPFLAG          |
| A2 UL Search measurement    | ReportConfigSearch                 TOOLTIPFLAG          |

Primary and secondary reporting refer to the option to use different settings for two

simultaneous measurements. The A2 Search measurement is used if the feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is activated. It then replaces the

primary and secondary A2 measurements. The A2 UL Search measurement is triggered by eNodeB

uplink measurements and is used if the feature Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility is

activated.

### 1.5.3 A3 Measurement

Neighbor cell becomes offset better than serving cell, leading

to intra- or inter-frequency handover. The MO classes used to configure

A3 measurements are listed in Table 4:

Table 4   A3 Measurement Configuration MOs

| Event Type                        | MO Class                                                |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| A3 intra-frequency UE measurement | ReportConfigEUtraBestCell                 TOOLTIPFLAG   |
| A3 inter-frequency UE measurement | ReportConfigEUtraIFBestCell                 TOOLTIPFLAG |

### 1.5.4 A5 Measurement

The A5 measurements can be configured with several attributes.

The serving cell becomes worse than a first threshold and an inter-frequency neighbor cell

becomes better than a second threshold. The A5 measurements can be configured with the

following MO classes:

- ReportConfigA5
- ReportConfigA5Anr
- ReportConfigA5DlComp
- ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio
- ReportConfigA5EndcHo
- ReportConfigA5Spifho
- ReportConfigA5UlTraffic
- ReportConfigA5UlTrig

An EUtranFreqRelation MO instance must exist under the

EUtranCellFDD or the EUtranCellTDD MO class for the

feature to work correctly. For more information, see Inconsistent Configuration.

### 1.5.5 B1 Measurement

The B1 measurement implies that Inter RAT neighbor becomes better than the threshold. This

measurement is used for the following scenarios:

- When searching for a suitable target cell when CS Fallback is triggered for the UE.
- When selecting suitable UE for offload and the B1 measurement threshold Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) ensures that the target UTRAN cell provides good enough coverage for the UE.
- For the EN-DC procedures: Secondary Node Addition Secondary Node Modification Secondary Node Release
- When NR SA-capable UE searches for a suitable NR SA cell.

The report configurations for B1 measurements are included in MO Classes listed in

Table 5.

Table 5   B1 Measurement Configuration MOs

| Measurement Type                          | MO Class                 |

| NR SA B1 measurement                      | ReportConfigB1NR         |

#### 1.5.5.1 Measurement Gap Configuration for B1 Measurements for EN-DC Setup

A measurement gap can be configured for B1 measurements on NR frequencies for an

EN-DC setup.

To set up EN-DC for a UE, the eNodeB orders the UE to perform an LTE inter-RAT B1

measurement. This measurement helps the UE find a suitable NR cell. The EN-DC-capable UE

uses the B1 measurement gap to receive the synchronization signal of the candidate NR

cell. If EN-DC is set up for the UE, the eNodeB acts as the Master Node.

The B1 measurement

gap can be enabled or disabled with the following attributes:

- EndcUserProfile.endcB1MeasGapConfigOverride at ASG level
- EUtranCellFDD.endcB1MeasGapConfig at cell level
- EUtranCellTDD.endcB1MeasGapConfig at cell level

The Master Node

does not need to configure measurement

gaps for B1 measurements on High-Band frequencies for EN-DC setup in

the following cases:

- If the UE is capable of independent measurement gap configuration, and it signals this capability to the Master Node.
- If one of the related attributes is set to DISABLED or DISABLED\_FR2.

If a B1 measurement is configured on the Master Node that supports independent

measurement gap configuration, the Master Node has the following measurement gap options

depending on UE capability:

- If the UE does not report independent measurement gap capability and B1 measurement gap is enabled in the Master Node, a measurement gap is applied for the UE on frequency ranges depending on the related attribute settings.
- If the UE supports independent measurement gap configuration, an independent measurement gap is applied on Low-Band or Mid-Band frequencies, and gapless measurement is applied on High-Band frequencies.

Disabling the measurement gap can decrease the

throughput degradation for the UEs that are capable of gapless measurements on High-Band

frequencies. In this case, the UEs must support B1 measurements without the measurement

gap to send B1 measurement reports. If this requirement is not fulfilled, the UEs do not

send B1 measurement reports while the measurement gap is disabled.

The synchronization signal is broadcast in the NR cell in the form of the SSB, which is

used for UE frame synchronization. The SSB periodicity in NR is longer than in LTE, so

the measurement gap must be aligned with SSB signaling. This way, the UE can detect the

SSB within the gap.

For the UE, the B1 measurement gap is aligned with an SSB measurement window. The UE

detects and measures the SSB in this measurement window. The alignment is calculated

based on the following parameters:

- SSB measurement window periodicity. This value is set through the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.smtcPeriodicity attribute.
- SSB offset. This value is set using the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.smtcOffset attribute. The attribute configures an offset for the SSB measurement window in which the SSB is detected and measured by the UE.
- SSB duration. This value is set using the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.smtcDuration attribute to configure the measurement window.
- Subframe difference between the LTE cell and the NR cell. This value is set using the EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset or the EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute. The choice of attribute depends on the serving LTE cell.

Both 10 ms and 20 ms are supported for the

GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.smtcPeriodicity attribute in the Master

Node. The system performs the following functions:

- Calculates the alignment of the measurement gap with the SSB measurement timing window.
- Uses the settings of the attributes for calculations.
- Considers the measurement gap offset to align half of the frame. It is in this half that the SSB is signaled in the NR cell.

If the measurement gap overlaps with the duration set for the DRX, the duration timer is

extended for the EN-DC-capable UE during the use of B1 measurement or SCG, but without

the VoLTE service.

The B1 measurement gap is supported by the LTE CSI-RS in the Master Node. The LTE CSI-RS

subframe offset can be shifted so that it does not collide with the measurement gap.

Offset shifting is enabled by setting the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.nRResCoordPattern
- EUtranCellTDD.nRResCoordPattern

An optimized B1 measurement can be achieved by configuring the subframe offset to

match the LTE CSI-RS. This way, the impact on the EN-DC-capable UE throughput is

minimized when using SCG radio resources. The choice of attribute depends on the duplex

mode of the serving LTE cell. If either of the attributes is set, the B1 measurement gap

does not overlap with NR TRS and NR CSI-RS. This is possible only if the gap periodicity

is greater than or equal to the periodicity of the NR TRS and the NR CSI-RS.

NR frequencies must be synchronized in time. This way, the B1 measurement gap window can

be aligned to the SSB of the respective NR frequencies. B1 measurement can be performed

on multiple NR frequencies at the same time. The measurement gap is chosen based on the

highest value set for the GUtranFreqRelation.endcB1MeasPriority

attribute. This applies to each RRCConnectionReconfiguration message that

contains B1 measurement configurations. In High-Band cells, the B1 measurement gap is

adapted to long SSB durations. As a result, the highest value setting is recommended in

High-Band for the GUtranFreqRelation.endcB1MeasPriority attribute in

an RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.

Both EN-DC and Release with Redirect to NR trigger B1 measurement. However, they can be

isolated by configuration. The value of the

UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas attribute must be at least three

times greater than the sum of the values of the

UeMeasControl.endcMeasTime and the

ReportConfigB1GUtra.timeToTriggerB1 attributes. This way, the

required EN-DC RRC reconfigurations can be ensured. It is possible that EN-DC and

Release with Redirect to NR are not isolated. In such cases, Release with Redirect to NR

uses the measurement gap chosen by EN-DC.

### 1.5.6 B2 Measurement

The B2 measurement implies that the serving cell becomes worse than a first threshold, and an

interRAT neighbor cell becomes better than a second threshold. This measurement confirms if

the UE listens to cells (UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, and CDMA2000 eHRPD) or frequencies (GERAN),

before a release with redirect or handover is triggered to those technologies.

5. Set the voicePrio for EUtranFreqRelations to a desired priority value. The value 0 means the lowest priority, the value 7 means the highest priority, and the value -1 means the frequency is excluded.

## 2.34 Configure Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover, Priority-Triggered Handover

To configure this feature for priority-triggered handover, do the

following:

Steps

1. Configure the Measurement-Based Inter-Frequency Handover feature as described in Configure Measurement-Based Inter-Frequency Handover.
2. The feature is used together with multiple radio bearers per user. To install, see Multiple Radio Bearers per User, and Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
3. Install the license and activate the feature state as described in Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover, and Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes. The licensing MO is ServOrPrioTriggeredIFHo .
4. Set parameter servOrPrioTriggeredIFHo to ARP in either of EUtranCellFDD TOOLTIPFLAG and EUtranCellTDD TOOLTIPFLAG MO.
5. Set the arpPrio for EUtranFreqRelations to a desired priority value. The value 0 means the lowest priority, the value 7 means the highest priority, and the value -1 means the frequency is excluded.

## 2.35 Configure Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band

This function enhances the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature

so that Carrier Aggregation (CA) is enabled for more UEs. UEs can

support CA on the MFBI additional band even if they cannot on the

primary band. If this is the case, the eNodeB immediately triggers

an intra-cell handover to the MFBI additional band. This occurs after

initial context setup, reestablishment and incoming handover. The

result increases availability of Carrier Aggregation.

It is also possible for an operator to prioritize between the bands, regardless of the

current CA possibilities for the band in use. The most prioritized band for which there are

valid CA combinations will then be chosen. Furthermore, intra frequency X2 handover is done

directly to the same band in target eNodeB as used in source eNodeB, which is optimizing the

performance.

The following attributes are used to control Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band:

- ENodeBFunction.caAwareMfbiIntraCellHo TOOLTIPFLAG Turns the Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band function on and off.
- ENodeBFunction.useBandPrioritiesInSCellEval TOOLTIPFLAG Turns the band prioritization functionality on and off.
- ENodeBFunction.prioritizeAdditionalBands TOOLTIPFLAG Decides whether primary or additional bands should be prioritized.
- EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList TOOLTIPFLAG EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList TOOLTIPFLAG Provides the priority order between the additional bands.

## 2.36 Configure Overlaid Cell Detection

To configure conditions for the Overlaid Cell Detection feature, use the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellRelation.incomingLoadBalancing The incomingLoadBalancing attribute determines if feature Overlaid Cell Detection has qualified this cell relation as an overlaid neighbor, i.e. high hit rate, on the corresponding frequency relation. The value TRUE means that the neighbor cell is encouraged to initiate load balancing towards the source cell. The value FALSE means that no specific preference exist.
- EUtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated The lbCovIndicated attribute determines if the cell relation has high hit rate towards the source cell. The attribute is automatically updated when the feature Overlaid Cell Detection is operable.
- LoadBalancingFunction.txPwrForOverlaidCellDetect The txPwrForOverlaidCellDetect attribute determines the maximum transmission power of the source cell on which feature Overlaid Cell Detection is allowed to be applied. For source cells with higher transmission power than specified in this attribute, overlaid neighbor cells are not identified.

For more information about the feature, see Overlaid Cell Detection.

## 2.37 Configure E-RAB Setup Reject Cause

When an E-RAB setup (E-RAB modification) is started during the intra eNodeB handover, or

when E-RAB setup is started during intra eNodeB re-establishment, procedure it is

rejected. Also, when the intra eNodeB Context Fetch procedure is started during RRC

connection reconfiguration triggered by E-RAB setup, the E-RAB setup procedure is

rejected. The default reject cause used in these cases prevents certain MMEs from

performing a second E-RAB setup attempt. The reject cause can be configured by setting

the attribute zzzTemporary52 in either of these

ways:

- If the reject cause X2 Handover triggered is to be used, set zzzTemporary52 to 1.
- (Default) If the reject cause Interaction with other procedure is to be used, set zzzTemporary52 to a value different than 1.

## 2.38 Configure Category M Connected Mode Mobility

This feature provides connected mode mobility for Category M1 UEs. For intra-frequency

mobility, it uses X2 or S1 based intra-frequency handover. For inter-frequency mobility,

it uses both blind and measurement-based handover, and blind and measurement-based

release with redirect to E-UTRAN cells. The following attributes are used to configure

this feature:

- EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowedBrIf set to true, this attribute enables handover of Category M1 UEs between cells.
- UeMeasControl.intraFreqMeasModeBrDetermines how the intra-frequency A3 measurement is configured, with measurement gaps if needed: If set to 0, the intra-frequency A3 measurement is configured when a supported Category M1 UE is connected. If set to 1, the intra-frequency A3 measurement is configured when the UL-normalized SINR of PUSCH is lower than the threshold determined by the ReportConfigA1A2Br.a1a2UlIntraSearchIntraFThr attribute. This is the default value.
- UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveBrIf set to true, this attribute enables inter-frequency measurements for Category M1 UEs.
- EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrioBr and EutranFreqRelation.voicePrioBr These attributes determine priorities among frequencies to measure for Category M1 UEs.
- EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionBrThis attribute determines what is the preferred way of transferring a Category M1 UE to the given frequency.
- ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThrRsrpPrimOffsetCeABr or ReportConfigEUtraBadCovSec.a2ThrRsrpSecOffsetCeABr These attributes determine the A2 RSRP offsets specific for Category M1 UEs.
- ReportConfigA1Prim.a1ThrRsrpPrimOffsetCeABr or ReportConfigA1Sec.a1ThrRsrpSecOffsetCeABr These attributes determine the A1 RSRP offsets specific for Category M1 UEs.
- EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowedBr and EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicatorBr If the EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowedBr attribute is set to true, and the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicatorBr attribute of the neighbor cell is set to COVERS, blind inter-frequency handover for the Category M1 UE can be initiated.
- EUtranCellFDD.measGapShareSchemeCeABr or EUtranCellTDD.measGapShareSchemeCeABr These attributes determine how the UE shares the measurement gaps when both intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements require it.

## 2.39 Configure Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

The Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement for Multiple Frequency Band

Indicators feature provides a possibility to change the priority of bands the UE is using

during initial connection setup or handover.

This enhancement requires a license for Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature to be

operable.

For the limitations on using this enhancement in X2 handovers, see the Restrictions of

Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 chapter in Multiple Frequency Band Indicators.

To be able to support this enhancement, the UE must fulfill the following conditions:

- The UE must support MFBI (The value of FGI bit 31 set to 1)
- The UE must support FBIP (The value of freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 set to 1)
- The UE must support band prioritization on a primary band and at least 1 additional band.

If a UE supports band prioritization and at least one additional band of a cell, it

connects to the additional band in the following cases:

- At initial connection setup
- At connection reestablishment
- During S1 handover
- During X2 handover
- During intra-eNB handover

This can occur even when it supports the primary band as well. The operator can

prioritize additional bands over the primary band and other additional bands. It is

recommended to enable Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band together with this feature,

for the stickyEARFCN handover functionality.

The following attributes are used to configure Frequency Band Indicators Priority Rel-12

enhancement:

- EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio Activates and deactivates the feature.
- EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList Lists all supported additional frequency bands.
- EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList
- ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled
- EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio
- EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList

Lists additional frequency bands in the order of priority. If it is empty or it contains

frequency bands that are not listed in additionalFreqBandList, it is

considered faulty and not used. If it contains fewer bands than

additionalFreqBandList, the remaining supported bands are added

to the end of the priority list used.

## 2.40 Configure NB-IoT Load Distribution

The NB-IoT Load distribution feature provides a basic intra-eNodeB traffic load

distribution mechanism for NB-IoT UEs. It redistributes UEs at connection

release to carrier frequencies randomly selected from a list. The list of frequencies to

use and the proportion of UEs to be redirected to each of them is configurable by the

following parameters:

- NbIdleModeLoadDistr.nbCarrierFreqList This parameter defines the carrier frequencies that are candidates for the load distribution. Maximum eight frequencies can be on the list.
- NbIdleModeLoadDistr.nbFreqDistributionList This parameter defines the proportion of UEs to be redirected to each frequency from NbIdleModeLoadDistr.nbCarrierFreqList. The sum of these proportions cannot exceed 100%. If the sum is less than 100%, a proportion of the UEs, equal to the difference between the sum and 100%, are not redirected.

## 2.41 Configure Category M Load Distribution

The Category M Load Distribution feature provides a basic intra-eNodeB traffic load

distribution mechanism for Category M UEs. It redistributes UEs at connection release to

carrier frequencies randomly selected from a list.

To activate the feature, after activating the license control MO, do the following:

1. Configure the EUtranCellFDD.idleModePrioAtReleaseRef attribute with a reference to an instance of the IdleModePrioAtRelease MO class. To set this attribute, the EUtranFreqRelation MO class must be defined for each frequency defined in IdleModePrioAtRelease. If the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature is active in the cell, this attribute is already defined. Otherwise it is set to null by default.
2. Configure the IdleModePrioAtRelease.catMFreqDistributionInfo attribute in the referenced instance of the IdleModePrioAtRelease MO class.

The list of frequencies to use and the proportion of UEs to be redirected to each of them

is configurable by the following parameters:

- CatMFreqDistributionInfo.eUtranFreqRefList This parameter defines the carrier frequencies that are candidates for the load distribution. Maximum eight frequencies can be on the list.
- CatMFreqDistributionInfo.freqDistributionList This parameter defines the proportion of UEs to be redirected to each frequency from CatMFreqDistributionInfo.eUtranFreqRefList. The sum of these proportions cannot exceed 100%. If the sum is less than 100%, a proportion of the UEs, equal to the difference between the sum and 100%, are not redirected. It is possible to configure both single frequencies and groups of frequencies. A frequency group is defined when a frequency with a proportion larger than 0% is followed by one or several frequencies with a proportion of 0%. The proportion for the first of these frequencies is then valid for all frequencies in the group.

## 2.42 X2 Message Control to Other Vendors

The X2 signals sent to non-Ericsson eNodeBs are controlled with the

AmoFunction.allowInterVendorX2Signal attribute. The following X2

signals sent by  Automated Mobility Optimization are controlled:

- X2AP RLF INDICATION
- X2AP HANDOVER REPORT

The attribute has no impact between Ericsson eNodeBs.

## 2.43 VoLTE-Aware Automated Mobility Optimization

If EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is set to

ENABLED, then the followings apply:

- EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtranQci1 is applied to UEs that have QCI1 bearer configured.
- EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran is applied to UEs that do not have QCI1 bearer configured.

If EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is set to

DISABLED, then

EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran must be applied to

all UEs regardless of services.

If both EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled and

EUtranCellRelation.amoState are set to ENABLED,

the following applies:

- QCI1 CIO EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtranQci1 is adjusted by VoLTE, QCI1 mobility input.
- Data CIO EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran is adjusted by data, non-QCI1 mobility input. Data CIO reuses the same attribute of legacy CIO.

If EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is set to

DISABLED and EUtranCellRelation.amoState is set

to ENABLED, then legacy CIO values are adjusted based on all mobility

input.

EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran is adjusted by all

mobility input regardless of services.

If EUtranCellRelation.amoState is set to DISABLED,

then CIO is not adjusted.

## 2.44 Mobility of Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

Intra-LTE mobility of UEs with an active mission-critical bearer is similarly handled

to those with an active VoLTE bearer, with a few differences.

Bearers with service type PTT are handled like bearers with the

service type VOIP, and bearers with the service type

MC\_SIGNALING are handled like bearers with the service type

IMS\_SIGNALING. The difference is that for mobility actions,

bearers with the service type MC\_SIGNALING are also considered as a

trigger. This is because Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk is considered active even if

only the signaling bearer is set up, unlike VoLTE.

The following features are adapted to handle intra-LTE mobility of UEs with active

mission-critical bearers like VoLTE UEs:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Intra-LTE Handover
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage
- Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Shared LTE RAN
- Subscriber Triggered Mobility
- Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

Mobility towards GERAN and UTRAN, including session continuity, SRVCC handover, and CS

fallback, is also handled similarly to UEs with VoLTE bearers. However, if there are

restrictions on Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk service in these networks, it can also

prevent mobility towards them in order to keep the UE on the LTE network as long as

possible.

For Release with redirect towards GERAN and UTRAN networks, the same handling is

applied to mission-critical bearers than for VoLTE bearers. It means the same

attribute (UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1) is used for

Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk as for VoLTE to regulate it.

The following features are adapted to handle mobility towards GERAN and UTRAN for UEs

with active mission-critical bearers:

- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover
- CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN
- Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback
- SRVCC Handover to GERAN
- SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

Mobility towards CDMA-based networks is not supported. This means that the following

features do not apply to the new QCIs:

- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity
- CS Fallback to CDMA 1X
- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

## 2.45 Configure Release with Redirect to NR

Steps

1. Create GUtranFreqRelation MO instance for each NR frequency that is a candidate for RwR.
2. Set the selection priority of NR frequencies in the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute. Note: To exclude a GUtranFreqRelation MO instance from RwR, set the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute to -1. Note: NR frequencies having ARFCN value not corresponding to a GSCN value as specified in TS 38.101 must be excluded for Release with Redirect to NR. Note: NR frequencies involving ESS NR cell with inactive IssSupportForNrStandalone optional feature license are not recommended to be configured for Release with Redirection to NR.
3. Set the selection priority of NR frequencies for VoLTE connections in the GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
4. Set the parameters of ReportConfigB1NR MO instance for Event B1 NR report configuration.
5. Optional: Set the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute to a value different than its default value to enable the use of different time-to-trigger values for each frequency relation. Note: This step is optional. The different time-to-trigger values increase the possibility of prioritizing the affected frequency over the other frequencies during the B1 measurement.
6. Configure the following parameters for periodic B1 measurement configuration: ReportConfigB1GUtra.reportIntervalB1 UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt If the UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt attribute is set to -1, the waitForNRMeas timer does not expire, and the configured B1 measurement is not deconfigured by the timer. UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas If the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas attribute is set to -1, the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer does not expire, and the B1 measurement is not configured again after deconfiguration by the waitForNRMeas timer.
7. Configure the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasEnabled parameter to enable the feature activation on each cell. Feature activation on the nodes is controlled by license.

## 2.46 Configure Threshold for B1 NR Measurement Report

The RSRP and RSRQ threshold values that trigger the B1 measurement can be configured

separately.

Steps

1. The trigger quantity for B1 measurements can be set with the ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR attribute: Option Description Set ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR to SS\_RSRP. The ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute configures the RSRP threshold value. Set ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR to SS\_RSRQ. The ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrq attribute configures the RSRQ threshold value.
2. Set the RSRP or RSRQ threshold for B1 measurement:
    - Set the RSRP threshold with ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrp.
    - Set the RSRQ threshold with ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrq.

## 2.47 Cell-level LTE to NR Standalone Handover

Attributes in the GUtranCellRelation and

the GUtranFreqRelation MO classes indicate if LTE to NR Standalone

handover between cells in the cell relation is allowed.

Handover to NR Standalone at Good LTE Coverage

LTE-to-NR

Standalone handover is initiated

if

the following conditions are fulfilled:

- A B1 NR standalone measurement report is received.
- All other conditions for the handover are fulfilled.
- The GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true.

The GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute also affects

the PCI.

If

this attribute is set to false for the strongest

PCI in the measurement report, weaker PCIs are evaluated for the handover

instead.

If the GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to

false for all measured PCIs, RwR is initiated to the reported

NR frequency instead.

If the GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed attribute is set to

true,

handovers with an ongoing VoLTE connection are initiated when the B1 NR standalone

measurement report is received and the conditions for the handover are

fulfilled.

VoLTE session mobility can be blocked for particular cells by setting the

GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed attribute to

false in the cell for which the relation is defined.

Handover to NR Standalone at Poor LTE Coverage

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER, handover to NR standalone frequencies is possible for

UEs.

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER, blind handover can be initiated if there is a

neighboring NR cell with the GUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator

attribute set to COVERS. If the

GUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to

RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT, only RwR

to

that neighboring NR cell is possible for UEs.

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER, and the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is

active in the cell,

the following attributes must be set to

true to allow RwR in the cell:

- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT,

the

values of the following attributes are not considered for mobility actions:

- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed

If the UE has an ongoing voice connection, the

UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute must be set to

true as well.

For further details, see Handover Evaluation in Outgoing NR IRAT Handover.

## 2.48 Direct Packet Forwarding from LTE to NR SA

Packet forwarding from LTE to NR standalone is handled as part of the Outgoing NR

IRAT Handover feature.

If the ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail attribute is set to

true and at least one data bearer is established, the

Direct Forwarding Path Availability IE in the HANDOVER

REQUIRED message indicates that a direct path exists between the source

eNodeB and the target gNodeB. In this case, direct packet forwarding is proposed.

Information about the bearers for which direct packet forwarding is proposed is included

in the Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent

Container IE in the e-RABInformationList IE. The

e-RABInformationList IE also contains information about the

bearers for which direct packet forwarding is not proposed. The maximum number of

bearers in e-RABInformationList is eight.

## 2.49 Traffic Load Balancing for EN-DC

Traffic load balancing can be enabled for EN-DC-capable UEs

without Secondary Node terminated DRBs and EN-DC-capable UEs with Secondary Node

terminated DRBs by configuring the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbActionForEndcUe
- EUtranCellTDD.lbActionForEndcUe

With the ENDC\_CAPABLE\_ALL

setting, traffic-triggered load balancing can be enabled for EN-DC-capable UEs without

Secondary Node terminated DRBs and EN-DC-capable UEs with Secondary Node terminated

DRBs.

With the

ENDC\_CAPABLE\_NOT\_CONFIGURED setting, traffic-triggered load

balancing can be enabled for EN-DC-capable UEs without Secondary Node terminated

DRBs.

The Master Node allows the following LTE load

balancing-triggered inter-frequency handover procedures for EN-DC-capable UEs based on

the configuration:

- Inter-frequency intra-Master Node handover
- Inter-frequency X2 handover
- Inter-frequency S1 handover
- IRAT handover
- Intra-Master Node handover without PSCell change
- Inter-Master Node handover without PSCell change

Figure 3   Load Balancing for EN-DC

Traffic load balancing can be enabled for EN-DC-capable

UEs in the following features:

- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload
- Admission-Triggered Offload
- Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA
- Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB
- UE Throughput-Aware IFLB
- Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management
- Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload

The SPID based load balancing mechanism can be used to ensure that EN-DC capable UEs

without SN terminated bearers and EN-DC capable UEs with SN terminated bearers can be at

the right LTE frequency or anchor carrier where the UE can access NR coverage. The

mobility can also be blocked at certain LTE frequency layers where the UE cannot access

NR coverage.

For more information about SPID, see Subscriber Triggered Mobility.

## 2.50 Optimization of B1 Measurement Gap on TM9 Configured Cell

This enhancement allows coexistence between LTE and NR network state reference

signals, SSB transmission patterns, and B1 Measurement Gap in EN-DC. The LTE CSI

reference signal is offset by the configuration of  the following MOM parameters:

- EUtranCellTDD.nRResCoordPattern
- EUtranCellFDD.nRResCoordPattern

The preset value choices are the following:

| DEFAULT   |    | No delay subframes.                  |
|-----------|----|--------------------------------------|
|           |    |                                      |
| PATTERN_1 |    | Configures 10 subframe delay in TDD. |
|           |    |                                      |
| PATTERN_2 |    | Configures 12 subframe delay in FDD. |

Prerequisites

This enhancement requires a license for the Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature to

be operable.

For more information on licenses, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation

Codes.

Steps

1. Lock cell.
2. Set the value of the appropriate attribute, according to the following: Option Description To optimize B1 measurement gap on TDD cell: Set the value of EUtranCellTDD.nRResCoordPattern PATTERN\_1. To optimize B1 measurement gap on FDD cell: Set the value of EUtranCellFDD.nRResCoordPattern PATTERN\_2.
3. Unlock cell.

Results

B1 measurement gap is optimized.

## 2.51 Configure A2 Measurement Threshold Offset

The A2 measurement threshold offset values can be configured for search zones on cell level

and QCI level to differentiate the downlink A2 measurement threshold for the EN-DC-capable

UEs.

Prerequisites

- The Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature is activated.
- One of the following features is activated: Service Triggered Mobility Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility
- The UE is EN-DC-capable.
- The UE is connected to a cell that is capable of EN-DC connection, where one of the following attributes is not empty: EUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList EUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList

Steps

1. Configure the qciProfileRef parameter of the ReportConfigParamsQciOffsetEndc struct of the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.qciA1A2ThrOffsetsEndc attribute, referring to the offsetPerQciPrio parameter of the PrioOffsetPerQci struct of the UeMeasControl.prioOffsetPerQci attribute. Note: If more than one bearer exists for the UE, the QCI with the highest priority must be used. If more than one QCI has the highest priority with the same value, the one with the maximum threshold value must be used.
2. Configure the following parameters of the ReportConfigParamsQciOffsetEndc struct of the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.qciA1A2ThrOffsetsEndc attribute: Note: The operator can configure multiple instances of the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.qciA1A2ThrOffsetsEndc attribute, each referring to different QCIs.
    - a1a2ThrRsrpQciOffsetEndc
    - a1a2ThrRsrqQciOffsetEndc
3. If the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated with split search zone, configure the attributes for outer search zone threshold calculation:
    - If the value of the a1a2ThrRsrpQciOffsetEndc parameter in the ReportConfigParamsQciOffsetEndc struct of the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.qciA1A2ThrOffsetsEndc attribute is not 0, the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.a2OuterSearchThrRsrpOffsetEndc attribute replaces the ReportConfigsearch.a2OuterSearchThrRsrpOffset attribute.
    - If the value of the a1a2ThrRsrqQciOffsetEndc parameter in the ReportConfigParamsQciOffsetEndc struct of the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.qciA1A2ThrOffsetsEndc attribute is not 0, the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.a2OuterSearchThrRsrqOffsetEndc attribute replaces the ReportConfigsearch.a2OuterSearchThrRsrqOffset attribute.

### 2.51.1 A2 Measurement Threshold Offset Configuration Results

If the A2 measurement threshold offset values are configured, the eNodeB performs search

measurements. Depending on the coverage, different measurement threshold are configured to

the EN-DC-capable UE.

Bad Coverage Measurement

When an EN-DC-capable UE connects to the cell, bad coverage measurement A2 threshold

is configured for the EN-DC-capable UE.

Table 7 shows how the threshold is

Good Coverage Measurement

When the EN-DC-capable UE receives an  A2 measurement report, good coverage

measurement A1 threshold is configured to the EN-DC-capable UE.

Table 8 shows how the threshold is

calculated for good coverage measurement depending on the activated features.

A2 Measurement

The A2 measurement is configured to the EN-DC-capable UE if the following scenario

occurs:

1. The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is operable.
2. The value of one of the following parameters in the ReportConfigParamsQciOffsetEndc struct of the ReportConfigA1A2Endc.qciA1A2ThrOffsetsEndc attribute is not 0: a1a2ThrRsrpQciOffsetEndc a1a2ThrRsrqQciOffsetEndc
3. The search zone splits to inner search zone and outer search zone.

Table 9 shows how the threshold is

calculated for outer search measurement depending on the activated features.

## 2.52 A5 Measurement Configuration for Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover

A feature-specific A5 measurement configuration can be activated for the

Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature.

An A5 measurement configuration that is specific to the Service or

Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature can be activated with the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig
- EUtranCellTDD.spifhoDedicatedReportConfig

When a handover action that is triggered by the Service or Priority-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Handover feature is evaluated, an A5 measurement report is sent.

The value of the UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheckSpifho attribute

controls whether both RSRP and RSRQ are checked during handover evaluation.

## 2.53 B1 Measurement Configuration to Prioritize Mobility Actions to Different NR Frequencies

Two configuration methods to enable NR frequency prioritization for B1

measurement-based mobility actions.

Time-to-Trigger Override Method

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute must

be set to a value other than -1000 to override the

ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1 attribute.

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute

allows the use of different time-to-trigger values for each frequency relation. This

attribute is used instead of the ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1

attribute if the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override

attribute is not set to its default value. The different time-to-trigger values

increase the possibility of prioritizing the affected frequency over the other

frequencies during the B1 measurement.

Time Window Method

The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attribute must be set to a value

of

40

or higher to make the timer operational.

The eNodeB stores the first B1 measurement report, but waits for the next measurement

report with a higher priority frequency until the timer expires.

If the priority of the frequency in the new measurement report is lower than in the

stored measurement report, the new report is ignored.

If the priority of the frequency in the new measurement report is equal to or higher

than in the stored measurement report, the new report replaces the stored

report.

If the priority of the frequency in the measurement report is the highest possible

configured for the UE, the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer

stops and the mobility action is triggered.

When the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow or the configurable

waitForNRMeas

timer expires, the eNodeB uses the latest stored measurement

report to trigger the mobility action to

NR

standalone.

Combined Method

If the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override and the

UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attributes are used together,

the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute

must be set to a lower value for a higher priority frequency. Improper configuration

might cause unnecessary delay in the mobility action to NR standalone.

## 2.54 A5 Measurement Configuration and Handling for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

A5 measurement conditions are defined through the

ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio MO class and its

attributes.

The LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority feature introduces the

ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio MO class and its attributes,

which allow the configuration of A5 measurements.

The A5 measurement is triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled continually for the

time defined by the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.timeToTriggerA5

attribute:

- If RSRP measurements are used, and the value of the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.triggerQuantityA5 attribute is set to 0, the conditions for the A5 measurement are the following: RSRP\_source &lt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold1Rsrp - ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 RSRP\_target &gt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold2Rsrp + ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 - EUtranFreqRelation.qOffsetFreq - EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran
- If RSRQ measurements are used, and the value of the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.triggerQuantityA5 attribute is set to1, the conditions for the A5 measurement are the following: RSRQ\_source &lt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold1Rsrq / 10 - ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 RSRQ\_target &gt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold2Rsrq / 10 + ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 - EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran - EUtranFreqRelation.qOffsetFreq

If the UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheck attribute is set to

true, the measured values of both RSRP and RSRQ are checked when an

A5 measurement report is triggered by RSRP or RSRQ.

The UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer is introduced to

define the waiting period for the A5 measurement report. If the

UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer expires without

A5 measurement, this A5 measurement is deconfigured.

If an A2 measurement report is received while waiting for the measurement result, the A5

measurement is deconfigured, and the procedure is stopped.

If A5 measurements are received within the time frame defined by the

UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer, the following

entering conditions are checked for the UE:

- The UE is using QCI1 bearers.
- The UE has an active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk connection.
- The UE is Category M type.
- The UE is involved in an emergency call.
- The UE has an EN-DC connection and the following attributes are set to false: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc

For UEs that fulfill any of these conditions, the procedure stops without any further

action.

The handover procedure is continued in the order of the arrival of the UEs if one of the

following options is applicable:

- More than one frequency is configured for measurement handling through the EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute.
- More than one SPID configuration is in place in case of SPID-defined priorities.
- More than one A5 measurement report is received.

## 2.55 Feature-Specific A1 and A2 Measurement Configuration and Handling for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

A1 and A2 measurement conditions can be configured through the attributes under the

ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio MO class.

The

configuration of the

EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas and the

EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

attributes

enable feature-specific A1 and A2 measurements for the LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to

Higher Priority feature. A1 and A2 measurements can be configured through the attributes

under

the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio MO class.

An A1 measurement is triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled continuously for

the time period defined by the

ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.timeToTrigger attribute:

- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 0, RSRP is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRP &gt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrp + ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresis
- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 1, RSRQ is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRQ &gt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrq / 10 + ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresisRsrq / 10

If a feature-specific A1 measurement report is received, the handover procedure

continues

and the entering conditions for A5

measurements

are checked.

If the SCG radio resources are released during A2 measurement configuration, the value of

the

EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

attribute

or the EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

attribute is not checked.

This

is because it is already known that the UE is in the feature-specific A1 coverage. In

this case, the A2 measurement is deconfigured and the handover procedure continues.

An A2 measurement is triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled continuously for

the

time

period defined by the

ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.timeToTrigger attribute:

- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 0, RSRP is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRP &lt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrp - ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresis
- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 1, RSRQ is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRQ &lt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrq / 10 - ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresisRsrq / 10

If a feature-specific A2 measurement report is received, a feature-specific A1

measurement is

configured.

This allows A5 measurements to be configured if a feature-specific A1 measurement report

is

received.

## 2.56 Observability of Priority Indication in RRC Release

The network performance of the Priority Indication in RRC Release Feature can be

observed with related PM counters.

If the Priority Indication in RRC Release feature is operable during the Release with

Redirect procedure, the following PM counters show an increase in the number of

attempted and established RRC connections:

- For UEs that use MPS: EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa
- For UEs that use IMS voice: EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttMoVoice EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccMoVoice EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttMoVoice EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccMoVoice

## 2.57 B1 Measurement Configuration for UEs with Service-Specific Configuration

A service-specific B1 measurement configuration can be activated for the LTE

Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility feature.

Periodic B1 NR measurements can be configured through the

UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt and the

UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas attributes.

To activate the feature, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature must be activated.
- The EutranCellFDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef and the EutranCellTDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef attributes must be associated with at least one QCI.

By default, all UEs are affected by the feature after the feature is activated in the

cell. However, it is possible to exclude UEs based on their SPID values from the

mobility restrictions if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is activated.
- The UeProfileFilter.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed and the RATFreqPrio.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed attributes are set to true.

Process Steps

1. The UE connects to the cell or another mobility trigger happens.
2. The eNodeB checks if one of the following attributes refers to at least one QCI to determine whether mobility to NR standalone deployment is allowed for the UE: EUtranCellFDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef EUtranCellTDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef
3. The eNodeB checks if QCI criteria are met. The feature can configure B1 NR standalone measurements only when QCI criteria are met. Otherwise, the eNodeB stops the B1 NR standalone measurement process and waits for another trigger. When the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST or the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message is received, a QCI check is performed on the newly set up bearer or modified bearer, and mobility decision is made.Note: After the release of the last QCI-defined bearer, B1 measurements are removed and mobility to NR is blocked.
4. The eNodeB checks if the LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility feature can configure B1 NR standalone measurements.
5. The eNodeB determines the NR frequency candidates to configure the B1 NR standalone measurement. If no NR frequency candidates are available, the eNodeB stops the B1 NR standalone measurement process.
6. The eNodeB configures the B1 NR standalone measurement for the determined NR frequency candidates to the UE.
7. The eNodeB starts the configurable UeMeasControl.waitForNRMeas timer. For more information, see Manage Mobility LTE.
8. The eNodeB waits for the measurement report from the UE.
9. When the measurements are configured for the UE, the following might happen: If the B1 NR standalone measurement report is received, the eNodeB proceeds with Step 10. If the UeMeasControl.waitForNRMeas timer expires, the eNodeB starts the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer. The B1 NR standalone measurement might be reconfigured and the UeMeasControl.waitForNRMeas timer must be restarted. The B1 NR standalone measurement is removed by a blocking condition or service deactivation. If the B1 NR standalone measurements are removed, the eNodeB stops the B1 NR standalone process and waits for the next trigger.
10. When the measurement report is received from the UE, the eNodeB evaluates the report to determine if the UE is valid for mobility. The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is started if the following conditions are met: The eNodeB receives a B1 NR standalone measurement report that contains a cell with not the highest frequency priority value. The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is set to a value greater than 0.
11. If the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is enabled and the target cell is valid for IRAT inter-system handover, the eNodeB initiates the handover to the reported cell.
12. If the target cell is not valid for IRAT inter-system handover, but it is valid for RwR, the eNodeB initiates RRC connection RwR to the reported NR frequency.
13. If RwR is not possible, the handover process returns to Step 8.

## 2.58 Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users

Selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility

feature if the subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the

configurable threshold.

If the LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users feature is

activated, a subscription ratio threshold can be defined for the serving cell. If the

subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the defined threshold,

the selected high-priority UEs are handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature.

If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the defined threshold, the

selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the following features, if they are

activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

The high-priority UEs can be selected using the following attributes:

- RATFreqPrio.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl
- UeProfileFilter.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl

The subscription ratio threshold can be defined using one of the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr
- EUtranCellTDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr

For more information, see LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for

High-Priority Users.

## 2.59 Configure Mobility Delay for Robust Call Setup

The establishment of a QCI1 bearer for a VoLTE call can be prioritized by delaying

handover and RwR procedures when an attempt for VoLTE call setup is detected through IMS or

RRC signaling.

The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature delays handover, RwR,

and EN-DC procedures to prioritize the establishment of the QCI1 bearer for the

VoLTE call. Depending on the priorities in the network, the following attributes can

be used to configure the detection method and the mobility procedures delayed by the

feature:

- RobustCallSetup.imsSignalingDetectionEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.moVoiceDetectionEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled

For more information, see LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup.

Prerequisites

The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the value of the RobustCallSetup.imsSignalingDetectionEnabled attribute to true to enable the detection of IMS signaling on the QCI5 bearer. Result: The feature initiates the mobility delay procedure when SIP signaling is detected on the QCI5 bearer.
2. Set the value of the RobustCallSetup.moVoiceDetectionEnabled attribute to true to enable the detection of mobile-originating voice requests. Result: The feature initiates the mobility delay procedure when it detects an attempt at mobile-originating VoLTE call setup that is initiated by the reception of the establishmentCause IE defined as mo-VoiceCall-v1280 or emergency in the RRCConnectionRequest message.
3. Set the value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute to the default value of true to allow blind mobility actions when the UE is in poor coverage in the outer search zone or the critical zone. In downlink, if the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated, the feature works in the following way: The mobility delay is not initiated for detected attempts for VoLTE call setup if the UE is in the outer search zone or in the critical zone. Ongoing mobility delay is interrupted when an A2 Critical measurement report is received, allowing the blind mobility procedure to start immediately. In uplink, if the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature is activated, the feature interrupts the ongoing mobility delay when an A2 UL Critical Coverage measurement report is received, allowing the blind mobility procedure to start immediately.
4. Configure the procedures to be delayed. Table 10 Mobility Delay Configuration Parameter Default Parameter Setting Affected Measurement Report Affected Procedure Mobility Delay RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled true B1, B2 IRAT handover or RwR to GSM and WCDMA The feature discards incoming B1 and B2 measurement reports that trigger mobility procedures to GSM and WCDMA. RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Blind IRAT handover or RwR to GSM and WCDMA The feature blocks blind mobility procedures to GSM and WCDMA that are triggered by the reception of an A2 measurement report. RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage Blind IRAT handover or RwR to GSM and WCDMA If the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to false, the feature blocks blind mobility procedures to GSM and WCDMA that are triggered by the reception of the following measurement reports: A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled true B1, B2 IRAT handover or RwR to NR The feature discards incoming B1 and B2 measurement reports that trigger mobility procedures to NR. RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Blind IRAT handover or RwR to NR The feature blocks blind mobility procedures to NR that are triggered by the reception of an A2 measurement report. RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage Blind IRAT handover or RwR to NR If the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to false, the feature blocks blind mobility procedures to NR that are triggered by the reception of the following measurement reports: A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled true A3, A5 Intra-LTE inter-frequency or intra-frequency handover or RwR The feature discards incoming A3 and A5 measurement reports that trigger intra-LTE inter-frequency or intra-frequency mobility procedures. RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Blind intra-LTE handover or RwR The feature blocks blind intra-LTE mobility procedures that are triggered by the reception of an A2 measurement report. RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled true A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage Blind intra-LTE handover or RwR If the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to false, the feature blocks blind intra-LTE mobility procedures that are triggered by the reception of the following measurement reports: A2 Critical A2 UL Critical Coverage RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled true B1 EN-DC Secondary Node Addition, Secondary Cell Group Addition The feature discards incoming B1 measurement reports that trigger the EN-DC Secondary Node Addition and the Secondary Cell Group Addition procedures. If the value of this attribute and the ENodeBFunction.endcS1OverlapMode attribute is set to true, QCI1 establishment requests are delayed until the ongoing EN-DC procedure is completed.
