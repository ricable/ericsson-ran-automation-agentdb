# 2 Remedy Action for FieldReplaceableUnit: SW version mismatch in peer Baseband P

Baseband P detected that its software version is in mismatch with the software

version of the peer Baseband P (in Tandem Baseband P). When Baseband P connected to

one RBS or Baseband unit each, the cause can be that the RBS software packages

including Baseband P software need to contain the same Baseband P software version.

One or both RBS software packages need to be updated. To remove the alarm, the

short-term action is to detach or re-configure the Baseband P.

Prerequisites

- The following documents have been read and understood: Handling Faulty Equipment Personal Health and Safety Information System Safety Information
- Other documentation referenced within the alarm operating instruction is available.
- Access to a node management tool is secured, if required.
- Access to the site is secured, if on-site activities are required.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Update Baseband unit software packages.
3. Lock the cell.
4. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for FieldReplaceableUnit: Compatible software for unit is missing, or the software running on unit is incompatible with running system release

## 3.1 Remedy Action for FieldReplaceableUnit with CIPRI: Compatible software for unit is missing, or the software running on unit is incompatible with running system release

The alarm is typically raised:

- When the FieldReplaceableUnit is shared with another ME and the software running on the FieldReplaceableUnit is not compatible with the installed radio node software package.
- When the installed software package does not support the hardware type and there is no pre-installed software installed on the FieldReplaceableUnit.

Prerequisites

- The following documents have been read and understood: Handling Faulty Equipment Personal Health and Safety Information System Safety Information
- Other documentation referenced within the alarm Operating Instruction (OPI) is available.
- Access to a Node Management tool is secured, if necessary.
- Access to the site is secured, if on-site activities are required.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Act on the alarm Software Management Lost Connection to File Serverfirst, when it is issued.
3. Check if Additional Text contains Mixed Mode with other ME.

If additional text contains Mixed Mode with other

ME, continue with Step 4. If Additional

Text does not contain Mixed Mode with other ME, go

to Step 6.

4. Check if the software package installed on the ME is newer than the software package installed on the ME sharing the FieldReplaceableUnit.

If the software package installed on the ME is newer, go to Step 5, otherwise go to

Step 6.

5. Perform restart of the Baseband unit with rank COLD.
6. Upgrade the software package for the ME if the alarm remains. The following conditions must be fulfilled when choosing software package:
    1. The software package must be compatible with the software package installed on ME sharing the FieldReplaceableUnit with regards to software for the hardware type of the FieldReplaceableUnit. This condition is only applicable if Additional Text contains Mixed Mode with other ME.
    2. The software package must contain software for the hardware type of the FieldReplaceableUnit. This condition is only applicable if the hardware type of the FieldReplaceableUnit does not support pre-installed software.

If the conditions are already fulfilled by the installed software package, go to

Step 8.

7. Upgrade the ME to the chosen software package.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

## 3.2 Remedy Action for FieldReplaceableUnit with Open Fronthaul: Compatible software for unit is missing, or the software is running on unit is incompatible with running system release

The alarm is typically raised:

- When the software running on the FieldReplaceableUnit representing the radio unit is not compatible with the installed radio node software package.
- When the installed software package does not support the hardware type and there is no pre-installed software installed on the FieldReplaceableUnit.

Prerequisites

- The following documents have been read and understood: Handling Faulty Equipment Personal Health and Safety Information System Safety Information
- Other documentation referenced within the alarm Operating Instruction (OPI) is available.
- Access to a Node Management tool is secured, if necessary.
- Access to the site is secured, if on-site activities are required.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Act on the alarm Software Management Lost Connection to File Serverfirst, when it is issued.
3. 6. Upgrade the software package. The following conditions must be fulfilled when choosing software package:
    1. a. The software package must be compatible with the software package installed on the node with regards to software for the hardware type of the FieldReplaceableUnit.
    2. The software package must contain software for the hardware type of the FieldReplaceableUnit. This condition is only applicable if the hardware type of the FieldReplaceableUnit does not support pre-installed software.

If the conditions are already fulfilled by the installed software package, go to

Step 4.

4. Perform node software upgrade using the updated software package.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
