# 2 Remedy Action for FieldReplaceableUnit

Steps

1. Identify what kind of hardware unit it is that sends the alarm and select remedy actions below.

## 2.1 Remedy Action for Baseband P

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the configuration of the IplPort MOs on the two Baseband P that must be configured, and ensure that their remoteIplPortRef attributes hold references to the correct IplPort MO instances. Port A must refer to port A, and port B must refer to port B on the two Baseband P.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Check that the Baseband P, which is connected with IPL, is the one indicated in the MO configuration, and, if necessary, remove cables and restart Baseband P.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

## 2.2 Remedy Action for Other Hardware Units than Baseband P

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Find the affected radio unit.

If an unsupported radio is connected to Radio Processor 6507, do the

following:

3. Replace the radio, and restart Radio Processor 6507.

4. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for IplPort

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the Baseband P for which the IPL cable alarm is issued, and locate the cable. Condition Action The IPL cable not connected to Baseband P Check if the both IPL cables between the tandem Baseband P is connected (Both IPL cables are required). If necessary, connect the missing IPL cable to one, or both Baseband P, and restart both Baseband Ps. The IPL cable connected to another Baseband P than configured Check if the configured tandem Baseband P are connected to each other according to the MO configuration and to the physical hardware configuration. If necessary, change the MO configuration, according to the physical hardware configuration, or connect the IPL cable, according to the MO configuration, and restart both Baseband Ps. IPL cable connected to unknown unit Check configuration for the two Baseband P that must be configured as a tandem Baseband P refers to each other. If necessary, configure new references. Check if the configured tandem Baseband P are connected to each other according to the physical hardware configuration. If necessary, connect the IPL cable, according to the MO configuration, and restart both Baseband Ps. The IPL cable connected to wrong port on peer Baseband P Check the IPL cables between the tandem Baseband P not are physical cross connected. If necessary, connect the IPL cable to the correct port on the other Baseband P, from a port A to port A and from a port B to port B, and restart both Baseband Ps.
3. Lock the cell.
4. Unlock the cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for RiPort

The Incompatible HW Configuration alarm is raised when

the power level of the SFP module is incompatible with the thermal limitations of

the Baseband unit.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Find the affected SFP module.
3. Select the correct type of SFP module, according to the SFP Module Selector Guide.
4. Replace the unsupported SFP module that is connected to the Baseband R, and insert the CPRI cable. The node automatically establishes a connection to the radio unit, and the radio becomes ENABLED. For more information, refer to Handling SFP Modules and Optical Cables.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Action for SfpModule: SFP power level exceeds port limitation.

The Incompatible HW Configuration alarm with this

additional text is raised when the power level of the SFP module is incompatible

with the thermal limitations of the Baseband unit.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Find the affected SFP module.
3. Select the correct type of SFP module, according to the SFP Module Selector Guide.
4. Send a technician to site.
5. Replace the unsupported SFP module that is connected to the Baseband R, and insert the CPRI cable. The node automatically establishes a connection to the radio unit, and the radio becomes enabled. For more information, see Handling SFP Modules and Optical Cables.
6. Verify that the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

7. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 6 Remedy Action for SfpModule: SFP or electrical cable not supported.

The Incompatible HW Configuration alarm with this

additional text is raised in the following cases:

- The DAC cable is attached to the RI port or TN port
- The unsupported SFP module is attached to the RI port or TN port

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Find the affected SFP module.
3. Select the correct type of SFP module, according to the SFP Module Selector Guide.
4. Send a technician to site.
5. Lock the unit.
6. Replace the unsupported SFP module or remove the unsupported DAC cable from the TN port or RI port. For more information, see Handling SFP Modules and Optical Cables.
7. Unlock the unit.
8. Verify that the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 7 Remedy Action for SectorEquipmentFunction: Non-identical fronthaul sharing units referenced by parameter rfBranchRef. MOs are listed in Additional Information.

The Incompatible HW Configuration alarm is raised if

not all AIR units are identical in a fronthaul sharing configuration.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Identify the non-identical unit.
3. Lock the non-identical unit.
4. Send a technician to site.

6. Unlock the unit.
7. Verify that the alarm has ceased.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 8 Remedy Action for SectorEquipmentFunction: TMA gain combined with uplink attenuation not supported by radio. Affected RfBranch MO instances listed in Additional Information.

The Incompatible HW Configuration alarm is raised if one

or more referenced RfBranches have incompatible uplink gain with the supported TMA

gain of the radio unit in use. This is applicable when the TMA gain is too

high

or uplink attenuation is configured incorrectly.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the supported TMA gain of the radio unit in the Ericsson Radio System Hardware library collection.
3. Check the TmaSubUnit.ulGain attribute referenced by the RfBranches to see TMA gain. If no TMA is used, assume that TMA gain is 0.
4. Check the RfBranch.ulAttenuation and the RfBranch.ulAttenuationPerFqRange attributes to see uplink attenuation.
5. Verify that the TMA gain combined with the uplink attenuation does not exceed the supported TMA gain of the radio in use.
6. If the TMA gain exceeds the supported values, correct the uplink attenuation configuration.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

7. Send a technician to site.
8. Replace the TMA with a compatible one.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

9. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.
