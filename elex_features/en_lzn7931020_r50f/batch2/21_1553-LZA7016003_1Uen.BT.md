# 1 Description

## 1.1 Cell

A Cell represents a specific frequency in a specific geographical

area that can be identified by a User Equipment (UE). A Cell in the

RNC is mapped to a specific Local Cell in the RBS. A Local Cell represents

the equipment used by the cell in the RBS.

A Cell is created or deleted in the RNC. A Local Cell is created

or deleted in the RBS. The Local Cell has no operational state over

NBAP, either the Local Cell exists or not from the RNC point of view.

### 1.1.1 No DL TX Power Detector

No DL TX Power Detector allows the detection of suspected sleeping cells based on the

radio carrier power levels.

The detection mechanism triggers in the order of minutes. Cell re-setup is automatically

triggered as a recovery mechanism. In case of recovery failure, an alarm is raised.

No DL TX Power Detector is active by default.

No DL TX Power Detection Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   No DL TX Power Detector Flowchart

The feature operates the following way:

1. If No DL TX Power event is detected on any carrier branch, it triggers cell re-setup.
2. Any other subsequent detections on other carrier branches is ignored while the recovery is ongoing.
3. The cell lock clears all alarms, including Downlink TX No Power Detected alarm.
4. If the recovery action was not successful, an alarm is raised on NodeBLocalCell MOC.

Hardware

No DL TX Power Detection is applicable to the radios that support VSWR

measurements.

## 1.2 Frequency Band

A frequency band represents a frequency span within which carriers

can be configured. The frequency bands are specified by the 3GPP standards.

For detailed information about frequency bands used for WCDMA, see Radio Node Configurations.

## 1.3 Introduction to WRAT MOM

The Figure 2 shows a schematic view of

selected Managed Object (MO) classes used to configure the WCDMA part of the Baseband

node in the Baseband MOM. In the Baseband MOM, the radio and antenna equipment are

grouped into one or more SectorEquipmentFunction MOs. A SectorEquipmentFunction MO is

single-band. A WCDMA sector can use resources from different SectorEquipmentFunction MOs to support

dual-band configurations. The SectorEquipmentFunction instances must

have the same antenna location and direction to support dual band.

Transport-related data is configured in the Iub MO tree. Iub MO is a parent MO to NbapCommon, NbapDedicated and IubDataStreams MOs.

When the Iub MO tree is

configured, in particular the NbapCommon and NbapDedicated MOs, it is

possible to establish the Iub link to RNC; see Allocated Iub Links (243/1543-AXD 105

03).

The local cells related data is configured in the NodeBLocalCellGroup MO

tree. RNC handles the UtranCell MO which is connected to the

local cell by a cell setup request from RNC.

## 1.4 Local Cell Configuration

A Local Cell Group contains a group of Local Cells that share a common Baseband equipment

cluster. In the Local Cell Group, softer handover is possible.

The Local Cell configuration is performed by setting the required

attributes according to the Managed Object Model (MOM). For instructions

on how to configure Local Cell, see Configure Local Cell. For prerequisites, see Prerequisites for Local Cell Configuration.

## 1.5 NBAP Bearer Configuration

The control connection between RBS and RNC uses Node B Application

Part (NBAP). NBAP is carried over Iub, which is a link that connects

RNC and RBS.

The NBAP Bearer configuration is performed by setting the required

attributes according to the MOM. For instructions on how to configure

NBAP Bearer, see Configure NBAP Bearer.

For prerequisites, see Prerequisites for NBAP Bearer Configuration.

## 1.6 HSDPA Configuration

The High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) configuration is performed by setting the

required attributes according to the MOM. For instructions on how to configure HSDPA, see

Configure HSDPA.

For information about Baseband support and configuration of carriers, IQ streams, and carrier

allocation mode, see Radio Node Configurations.

Table 1 gives an overview of functions and related

attributes for basic HSDPA configuration.

## 1.8 Sector Carrier Power Configuration

Attribute configuredMaxTxPower in MO

class         NodeBSectorCarrier specifies the requested absolute power of the Sector

Carrier. By default, the output power is evenly distributed over the antenna connectors that

are allocated for the Sector Carrier and used for TX transmission. However, the operator can

change the distribution of the output power over the antenna connectors by setting the

txBranchAPower attribute in the NodeBSectorCarrier MO.

In radio units shared by multiple radio access technologies competing for the same radio

resources, the available output power is allocated to each unlocked sector carrier or TRX or

extension TRX in a first come first served principle until all available output power is used.

For instructions on how to configure requested absolute power of a Sector Carrier, see Configure Requested Power of Sector Carrier.

When a Local Cell is in operationalState

ENABLED, the following attributes show the allocated effect:

- availableHwOutputPower in MO class SectorEquipmentFunction. The sum of the hardware power capability for all radio hardware in the Sector.
- maxDlPowerCapability in MO class NodeBLocalCell. The maximum downlink power capability for the Local Cell.
- minDlPowerCapability in MO class NodeBLocalCell. The minimum downlink power capability for the Local Cell.
- txPowerPersistentLock in MO class NodeBSectorCarrier. The total TX output power can be locked by the txPowerPersistentLock attribute. Therefore, the unwanted total output power changes to a higher value can be prevented during normal operation. When txPowerPersistentLock is set to true, the following operations are prohibited: Changing the attributes configuredMaxTxPower and txBranchAPower Deleting the MO NodeBSectorCarrier Setting txPowerPersistentLock back to false If txPowerPersistentLock is set to true, a re-integration of the node is required to change the setting of the attribute and to change the value of the total output power.

## 1.9 Deterministic Cell Allocation

The operator can connect the Sector Carrier to the antenna system by setting up

references between the NodeBSectorCarrier MO and the

RfBranch/CcBranch or branches that are used; see Connect Sector Carrier to Antenna.

The operator specifies the TX and RX branch to RF and CC branch mapping by configuring

the rfBranchTxRef and the rfBranchRxRef attributes in the MO

class NodeBSectorCarrier. These

configurations give the user an opportunity to, for example, select antenna or antenna

polarization for a specific TX and RX carrier branches. The configuration of the rfBranchTxRef attribute is optional.

The configuration of the rfBranchRxRef attribute is optional in

most cases. In case of the Analog Cross Connect radio configuration using a CcBranch,

the user must configure the rfBranchRxRef. For more information see

Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the rfBranchTxRef and the rfBranchRxRef attributes are not set,

then the system automatically selects RF branches of the referenced sector. The RF

branches are selected based on their connection to free radio resources. Thus, the final

allocation of RF branches to carrier branches can vary.

## 1.10 Multi-Carrier Cell Matching

### 1.10.1 Multi Carrier and Dual-Band HSDPA Multi-Carrier features

The Multi Carrier and the Dual-Band HSDPA Multi-Carrier features enable the combination

of two HSDPA-enabled cells for one radio link. If the attributes multiCarrierPair1..6 are not set, the

automatic algorithm provides pairs to use with the Multi Carrier and the Dual-Band HSDPA

Multi-Carrier features.

For the Multi Carrier feature, multi-carrier pairs are created starting from the lowest

frequency within each band.

For the Dual-Band HSDPA Multi-Carrier feature, pairs are created with cells from

different bands, starting from the highest frequency in each band. The two

SectorEquipmentFunction MO instances referred to in a

dualBandSectorGroupX attribute are mapped to the cells that cover the same geographical

area, for the two different frequency bands.

This algorithm maximizes the use of both features, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Multi-Carrier Cell Matching, Potential Pairs

### 1.10.2 HSDPA Multi-Carrier 3 Carriers feature

The HSDPA Multi-Carrier 3 Carriers feature enable the combination of three HSDPA enabled

cells for one radio link. The automatic algorithm is always used to provide secondary

serving cell matching, hence the multiCarrierPair 1..6 attributes are

not used for the HSDPA Multi-Carrier 3 Carriers feature.

The secondary serving cell list for a primary serving cell is created starting from the

lowest frequency. All cells belonging to the same

SectorEquipmentFunction as the primary serving cell are added to

the list.

Figure 4 shows potential

secondary serving cell candidates for HSDPA Multi-Carrier 3 Carriers. Note that for

HSDPA Multi-Carrier 3 Carriers only the first configuration can be used.

Figure 4   MultiCarrier Cell Matching for 3 Carriers, Potential Pairs

## 1.11 Allocation of Cells to HSDPA Processing Resources

Allocating cells to specific HSDPA processing resources can be done by steered

allocation and by automatic allocation.

Normally, automatic allocation is used. Sometimes, manual procedures, Steered HS

Allocation, can be used.

Cell carriers are mapped to resources in one of the following ways:

- Automatic allocation. Cell carriers are distributed evenly among the configured HS resources. It is the simplest method.
- Steered allocation. Cells or combination of cells are pinpointed to specific HS resources by manual configurations. This method is used when certain cells share certain HS resources in a specific way. Using steered allocation is recommended for configurations where the number of HSDPA codes differs between the configured cells.

### 1.11.1 Automatic Allocation

Automatic allocation is the default option for the resource allocation. The RBS system

automatically allocates HSDPA cores evenly to local cells. No manual operation is

needed.

### 1.11.2 Steered Allocation

With Steered Allocation , HSDPA cores can be allocated manually for some cases. For the

using cases, see Scenarios of Steered Allocation.

With this method, operators need to figure out an allocation plan based on the node

traffic situation. HS cores are allocated by setting related attributes manually

according to the plan. To use this method, operators must have the following

competence:

- Analysis of node performance management data
- Analysis of current HSDPA core allocation
- Experience in node management through parameters and commands Note: Make sure that using the Steered HS Allocation does not have a negative impact on the traffic.

#### 1.11.2.1 Scenarios of Steered Allocation

Steered Allocation can be used in the following cases:

- Sectors in the same local cell group have different traffic load. One has high traffic load, while others have idle or low-loaded cores.
- The traffic load in one sector has a predictable sharp increase. For example, a new train station is planned in a sector located in an urban area, while other sectors are located in a rural area. The current automatic allocation distributes the available HS cores evenly over local cells.

If sectors in the same local cell group have different traffic load, the following

criteria can be used to judge if a sector serves extreme high traffic:

- HsDschResources::pmAllocRejHwDschUsers is higher than the adjacent cells and is above the acceptable level.
- The average number of HSDPA users in the cores allocated to this sector almost reaches 320 (on Baseband 6621/6631). This is the maximum number of HSDPA users that one core can support.

The maximum number of HSDPA users in one local cell allocated to one core is 128, which

is limited by the attribute NodeBLocalCell::maxNumHsdpaUsers. For

multiple local cells that shared the same core, the maximum number of HSDPA users on a

core is 320 on Baseband 6621/6631.

The average number of HSDPA users in one local cell can be calculated with the formula in

Figure 5.

Figure 5   Formula 1: Calculation of Average Number of HSDPA Users in One Local Cell

The average number of HSDPA users in one core (X) can be calculated with the formula in

Figure 6.

Figure 6   Formula 2: Calculation of Average Number of HSDPA Users in Core X

#### 1.11.2.2 Allocation Plan of HSDPA Processing Resource

An allocation plan of HSDPA processing resource shows the allocation of HSDPA cores to

the local cells.

Current Allocation State of HSDPA Processing Resource

The following attributes or formula specifies the current allocation state:

- NodeBLocalCellGroup::numberOfHsCores indicates how many HSDPA cores can be used in a local cell group.
- NodeBLocalCell::hsCoreId indicates the ID of the HSDPA core that is allocated to the local cell.
- The formulas in Scenarios of Steered Allocation calculate the average number of HSDPA users.

Allocation Plan of HSDPA Processing Resource

The allocation plan aims to allocate more HSDPA Cores to high-loaded sectors. The

following requirements must be met during the configuration:

- The value of NodeBLocalCell::steeredHsCoreId ranges from 0 to NodeBLocalCellGroup::numberOfHsCores - 1.
- A local cell is configured with only one HSDPA core.
- One HSDPA core is allocated to no more than 12 cells on Baseband 6621/6631.

How to Calculate the Number of Local Cells Using the Same Core

To improve the efficiency of HSDPA core usage, local cells belonging to the same

sector or sector group but allocated to different HS cores are mirrored on all the

cores. Thus, the number of cells on a core is the sum of all local cells in the

sectors or sector groups that use this core.

For example, in Table 5, Sector 3 includes

four local cells and these cells use two cores (Core 4 and Core 5). Then the number

of local cells on each core is four.

In Table 6, Sector 2 and Sector 3 include

four local cells respectively, and Core 4 is shared by two cells in Sector 2 and two

cells in Sector 3. Then, the number of local cells on Core 4 is eight, that is, the

sum of local cell numbers in both Sector 2 and Sector 3.

Example for Steered Allocation

The following example illustrates how to make an allocation plan. Table 4 shows the current state of resource

allocation in a local cell group, which is a 3 × 4 site.

According to the criteria in Scenarios of Steered Allocation, Sector 1 serves

extreme high traffic while Sector 2 and Sector 3 are low-loaded.

Only one cell is allocated to Core 0 and Core 1, the

maximum number of HSDPA users is 128 due to cell

capacity limitation. Two cells are allocated to Core 2,

the maximum number is 160 due to HS core capacity. In

total, the maximum number of HSDPA users is 416 (128

+128 + 160).

Table 6 shows another re-allocation

example, but the number of local cells is more than six on Core 4. Thus, this

example is unsupported.

# 2 Procedures

## 2.1 Configuration Flow

The configuration flow is a configuration file template that can be reused for

multiple nodes and a site-specific configuration file by populating the template file with

site-specific parameters.

Template files can be created by using the basic configuration method (automatic template

creation with the ECT), or by the advanced configuration method (creation of new XML

Netconf files). The preferred procedure is to use the basic configuration method, and,

if the required configuration is not supported by the tool, to edit the template file

with an XML editor.

With the basic configuration method there is no need to understand the MO structure when

preparing the template files or the site-specific files. However, it is necessary to

understand the MO structure for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.

The ECT is described in more details in the Manage Equipment Configuration Tool document.

See Integrate Baseband Radio Node for instructions

on how to integrate  Manage Configuration Files for information on how to create

configuration files.

### 2.1.1 Radio Network Configuration File

Radio access configurations are specified in a configuration file that can be in a

Netconf or Bulk CM format. When using the Netconf format, the ECT can be used to

validate the file, and generate a template file based on the configuration.

When creating template files with the basic configuration method, the ECT generates the

required MO structure based on GUI input parameters.

Figure 7   MO Structure of Radio Network Settings

The ECT generates an MO structure with the following elements:

- ECT always creates one Iub, SctpProfile, NbapCommon,NbapDedicated, IubDataStreams MOs. Two SctpEndPoints MOs are created (one reserved for NbapDedicated and one for NbapCommon).
- For each cell in the GUI, one NodeBLocalCell MO instance is created.
- For each carrier in the GUI, one NodeBSectorCarrier MO instance is created.
- For each Baseband unit with allocated WCDMA cells, ECT creates one NodeBLocalCellGroup MO instance.

Table 7   Radio Network parameter Settings

| MO Class            | Instance Name                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| NodeBFunction       | 1                                    |
| NodeBLocalCellGroup | 1                                    |
| NodeBLocalCell      | Cell_identity parameter in GUI       |
| NodeBSectorCarrier  | Carrier_identity parameter in GUI(1) |
| Iub                 | 1                                    |

### 2.8.38 Configure Feature Pre-coder for Power Balancing, FAJ 121 1510

This basic feature enables mapping transmissions associated with one Local Cell carrier

configured with two TX branches. If the feature is not activated, each Local Cell carrier is

mapped to one TX branch.

The pre-coder function is used in Local Cell carriers configured with multiple TX branches

and benefit as follows:

- When using a two TX-branch radio it is possible to fully utilize the available power since all cells are distributed over (and use power from) both TX-branches. Without the pre-coder each cell is mapped to one branch or the other, so for an odd number of branches a fraction of the power will remain unused.

The Pre-coder for power balancing feature is activated by the following

settings:

- Set RBS attribute numOfTxAntennas in MO class NodeBSectorCarrier to 2.
- Set RNC attribute transmissionScheme in MO class UtranCell to SINGLE\_ANTENNA.

The  RBS attribute numOfTxAntennas is set at the sector carrier creation. As a result, to reconfigure

a sector carrier not using the pre-coder to activate the pre-coder,

the following steps must be performed:

Steps

1. Lock the corresponding UtranCell in the RNC.
2. Lock the corresponding Local Cell, see Lock Local Cell.
3. Set attribute numOfTxAntennas in MO class NodeBSectorCarrier to 2.
4. Set RNC attribute transmissionScheme in MO class UtranCell to SINGLE\_ANTENNA.
5. Unlock Local Cell, see Unlock Local Cell.
6. Unlock the corresponding UtranCell in the RNC.
