# 2 Remedy Action for AntennaUnitGroup: Unexpected signal level imbalance. Threshold exceeded for uplink path related to RF Branches listed in additional info compared to other branches in its Sector Equipment Function.

## 2.1 Remedy Action for LTE

This alarm is raised when an imbalance of signal

strength

fulfills all of the following conditions:

- 8 dB ≤ |avg(∆SINR)| ≤ 17 dB
- Standard deviation of |∆SINR| &lt; 25.5 dB

The threshold for when this alarm is raised can be configured through the

ENodeBFunction.rxBranchImbalanceThreshold attribute. For more

information about configurations, see Antenna System Monitoring.

The fault may be caused by either of the following reasons:

- Faulty calibration values for RfBranch or CcBranch loss in any of the diversity paths used for the SectorEquipmentFunction
- Faulty antenna path (for example an antenna, antenna feeder, antenna jumper, or connector)
- Mismatched antennas

For more information about antenna connections, see Antenna and RF Connections

RX availability is degraded. Perceived severity: MINOR.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the alarm. The additional information shows which RFBranch is attenuated.
3. Check if the calibration values are correct in for the RfBranch.ulAttenuation or CcLink.ulAttenuation MO in any of the diversity paths used for the SectorEquipmentFunction.
4. If the calibration values were incorrect, restart the radio unit as described in Manage Hardware Equipment.
5. Wait for the radio to start up and carry traffic. Note: Wait sufficient time for the alarm to cease. The minimum time to wait is 24 hours at high traffic load and up to several days at low traffic load.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

6. Send a technician to site.
7. Check if the feeder is connected properly to the antenna. For more information about antenna connections, see Antenna and RF Connections.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Wait sufficient time for the alarm to cease. The minimum time to wait is 24 hours at high traffic load and up to several days at low traffic load.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

## 2.2 Remedy Action for WCDMA

This alarm is raised when an imbalance of signal strength (3.0

dB≤|avg(∆rscp)|&lt;29.0 dB) is detected. The fault can be caused by the following

reasons:

- Faulty antenna path (for example, an antenna, an antenna feeder, an antenna jumper or, a connector).

For more information about antenna connections, see Antenna and RF Connections.

Wait sufficient time for the alarm

to cease. The minimum time to wait is one hour at high traffic

load and up to several days at low traffic load.

To save time on site, check if the following statement is true with signal strength

measurements during the Result Output Period (900 s):

If the statement is true, this indicates that the cause of the alarm is resolved. The

accuracy of this indication increases with the amount of samples.
