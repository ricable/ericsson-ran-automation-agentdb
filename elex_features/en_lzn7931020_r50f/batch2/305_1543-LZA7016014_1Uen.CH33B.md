# 1 Integration Overview

Integration is a series of activities, performed to introduce a new node into the

network.

The document covers installation and integration tasks, including the immediate

preparation required before starting on-site activities. Integration planning and

network provisioning aspects are described in Integration Planning and Infrastructure

Guidelines.

The node can be integrated using the Zero Touch Integration method, or

the on-

site Local Maintenance Terminal (LMT) integration method.

## 1.1 Integration Requirements

An overview of the hardware and software requirements for node

integration.

### 1.1.1 Integration Prerequisites

Integration requires a network infrastructure to be prepared in advance.

Network provisioning is a set of activities to create the environment for the node to

operate in. The scope is determined by the deployment solution and network-specific

factors, but usually the following must be prepared:

- Operations Support System (OSS)
- Transport network infrastructure and services, such as Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and Network Time Protocol (NTP) for time synchronization.
- Security aspects, such as gateways, firewalls, and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).

For further information on the provisioning aspects of integration, see Integration Planning and Infrastructure

Guidelines.

### 1.1.2 Integration Software Requirements

Integration requires the software to be up-to-date and the browser and Operating

System requirements to be met.

Software Levels for Baseband Deployment

Table 1   Recommended Minimum Software Levels for Baseband

Basebands that have VC encrypted with SHA-1 must use a

browser that supports SHA-1; Google Chrome version 117

or lower and Firefox version 132.0.2 or lower.

### 1.1.3 Hardware Installation Tools

Hardware installation requires an inventory of tools to be prepared before the

activity.

The exact list of tools can be found in the installation instruction relevant to the

hardware unit. Review and prepare the necessary equipment before starting the procedure.

The instructions are located in the Installation folder of the

applicable CPI collection, for example

RAN Compute

&gt; Installation

.

## 1.2 Baseband Radio Node Integration Phases

Integration is divided into phases, in which the integration is prepared, performed,

and validated.

Integration includes both on-site and off-site activities, performed by people with

different roles, competences, and authorities.

The process is divided into three main parts:

Early Preparation Phase

Scope: Planning activities and preparations on the network level, including

identifying type sites to be deployed.

Description: Based on the type sites identified during planning, configuration

templates or node profiles can be drafted as a future baseline for the site-specific

configuration files. Profiles created in early preparation can typically be used for

multiple deployments.

Preparation Phase

Scope: Preparations to ensure that hardware, software and other required

infrastructure is ready for integration.

Description: The site-specific files are prepared using the templates and profiles

created in Early Preparation, as well as site-specific parameter data.

Execution Phase

Scope: Hardware installation, power-on and monitoring.

Description: In this phase, hardware is installed and integration progress is

monitored until the node is ready for traffic.

### 1.2.1 Early Preparation Phase Overview

Integration Planning

A high-level plan of the integration is created. This task is outside the scope of

this guide but information relevant to integration planning can be found in Integration Planning and Infrastructure Guidelines.

Download and Import Upgrade Package

The Upgrade Package (UP) is downloaded from the Software Gateway and stored in ENM.

The ENM Node Health Check Application and the ENM Auto Provisioning Configuration

Generator both rely on the UP available in the ENM Software and Hardware Manager. If

node health checks are defined for integration, or if the node profile is created in

ENM Auto Provisioning, the relevant UP must be imported beforehand.

Optional: Define Node Health Check Profile for Integration

If health checks are to be automatically executed as part of the integration, a node

health check profile is created in the ENM Node Health Check application. The

reference to the profile is then used when creating configurations.

Optional: Create or Modify Node Profile in Equipment Configuration Tool

If Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT) is available, node profile can be created early

to save time in the preparation phase.

### 1.2.2 Preparation Phase Overview

Prepare Node Hardware

- Network Loader version is checked and updated, if necessary.
- Hardware integration state is secured.

Request and Import License Key File

License Key Files (LKF) for the node are ordered, delivered, and installed in one of

the following ways:

- Manual Licensing: A request is sent to the CU. The generated file is manually imported to ENM and used in the integration. The request must be sent in advance, as the LKF must be available in ENM before the integration starts.
- Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode: If the Instantaneous Licensing solution is enabled in the network, request, delivery, import, and installation of LKFs is automatic. Instantaneous licensing can be used with Integration Unlock or with LKF. If Integration Unlock is not used, Licensing information must be included in the configuration files. It is included by either filling in the Licensing fields in the Configuration Generator, or by manually adding the necessary tags to the project files and providing the licensing information in the new LicenseRequest.xml file. The use of multiple groupIds for EUFTs is supported for node integration using IntegrationUnlock.
- Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode: License resources are automatically granted for 21 days through IntegrationUnlock after completed integration. An LRF request must be generated using ENM Flow Automation and then submitted to the SSP-LKF Portal to generate required LKFs for the integrated node. The LKFs are imported and installed manually. The use of multiple groupIds for EUFTs is supported for node integration using IntegrationUnlock.

Create Configurations

The phase can be completed in the following ways:

- The configuration files are created in the ENM Auto Provisioning application. The resulting CIQ template is manually filled with node-specific data, and used as input for the integration order in ENM Auto Provisioning.
- The configuration files are created in the standalone Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT). The generated CIQ file is manually filled with node-specific data and bundled in an integration project ZIP file using ECT. The ZIP file is used as input to the integration order in ENM Auto Provisioning, or in ENM CLI.
- ECT is used to create a configuration which is as close to the desired configuration as possible. The template is then manually modified. This method can be used to include additional content that is not covered by ECT. The ZIP file is used as input to the integration order in ENM Auto Provisioning, or in ENM CLI.
- The configuration files and the integration project ZIP file are created manually. The ZIP file is used as input to the integration order in ENM Auto Provisioning, or in ENM CLI.

Two modes are available for preparing configuration files in ECT or ENM Auto

Provisioning:

- Node-centric mode: Generates a node-focused configuration template, to allow configuration of a specific node in the CIQ file.
- Cell-centric mode: Generates a cell-focused node profile, which is applicable to many nodes that differ by a set of parameters, cells and sectors defined in the CIQ file. This mode is available for NR and LTE. For more information on the cell-centric mode, see Manage Equipment Configuration Tool.

Add Node IP to DHCP Server

Setting up a DHCP server is a part of network provisioning, but the DHCP server

configuration might need to be extended when a new node is integrated.

When using ENM DHCP, the configuration is automatic.

An extension of the existing DHCP server configuration might be needed when:

- ENM DHCP server is not used.
- A static bind of the node IP address is required.
- The new node requires a new subnet and the DHCP pool for this subnet needs to be added to an external DHCP server.

When using the Zero Touch integration method together with static DHCP IP Address

assignment, the DHCP server must be configured to use the node permanent IP address

as the temporary address as well.

For more information on DHCP for integration, see Integration Planing and Infrastructure Guidelines.

Order Integration

Integration is ordered through ENM Auto Provisioning (AP) application, or using ENM

CLI. The ordering method depends on the tool used to create configurations.

### 1.2.3 Execution Phase Overview

Integrate Node

Node hardware must be installed and powered to start the integration.

Zero Touch Integration is automatic but can be supervised using a client connected to

the node. LMT integration requires a client to provide the SIF file and to trigger

the integration process.

Finalize Integration

This phase ensures that the integration is successfully completed.

When the site installation health checks are done, the cells can be unlocked to allow

traffic.

# 2 Early Preparation

The image below is interactive. Click on the relevant step, to view the instruction.

## 2.1 Download and Import Upgrade Package

The upgrade package must be imported before the integration.

Steps

1. Download the Upgrade Package (UP) ZIP file from the Ericsson Software Gateway and store it in a location accessible for ENM. If you do not have access to the Ericsson Software Gateway, contact the Customer Unit and request the UP.
2. Launch ENM and go to Software and Hardware Manager &gt; Software Administration .
3. Use Import Software Package to import the downloaded UP file to ENM.

## 2.2 Define Node Health Check Profile for Integration

A reference to a node health check profile can be included in the node profile and

executed as a part of the integration flow.

A node health check profile must be defined before creating configurations. The name of

the profile is then referenced in the configuration files.

The health check profile is created in ENM Node Health Check application. For

instructions on how to create it, see the Node Health Check application instructions in

ENM Online Help.

The following health check rules are recommended to include in the profile for

integration and can be selected from the ALL category:

Table 3   Health Check Rules for Integration

| Provider        | Health Check Rule ID         |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| ENodeBFunction  | CheckS1LinkStatus            |
| GNBCUCPFunction | CheckNgLinkStatus            |
| GNBCUCPFunction | CheckXnLinkStatus            |
| BtsFunction     | CheckAbisLinkStatus          |
| NodeBFunction   | CheckNbapCommonLinkStatus    |
| NodeBFunction   | CheckNbapDedicatedLinkStatus |

For more details on the health check rules, see Manage Node Health Check.

## 2.3 Create or Modify Node Profile in Equipment Configuration Tool

If Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT) is available, node profile can be prepared at

an early stage to save time during the preparation phase.

ECT can be used to create a node profile early, for example during integration planning.

The profile is then exported and used to create the CIQ file at a later stage. For

instructions on how to create a node profile in ECT, see Create Node Profile.

# 3 Preparation

The image below is interactive. Click on the relevant step to view the instruction.

## 3.1 Prepare Node Hardware

The aim of this activity is to ensure that the hardware is ready to be installed and

integrated.

To secure hardware readiness, Network Loader software version must be checked and

updated, if necessary. Hardware needs to be in the integration state before the

integration activities start.

### 3.1.1 Confirm Network Loader Software Version

It is recommended to check the Network Loader software version when introducing a new

node into the network.

Steps

1. Check the revision of the hardware unit against the table in Upgrade Network Loader to determine the Network Loader version.
2. If the revision is lower than required, upgrade the Network Loader by following the instructions in Upgrade Network Loader.

### 3.1.2 Confirm and Reset Hardware Integration State

The hardware unit must be in initial state, also called integration state, when

powered up for integration.

If the hardware has been used

before, make sure to confirm that the unit is in integration state.

Steps

1. Connect and power up the hardware unit.
2. Connect a client to the node. For instructions on how to connect a laptop or a mobile device to the node, see Connect Client.
3. Launch a web browser and connect to the Emergency Access GUI. For instructions, see Connect Client.
4. Make sure that the Node Status is Node is working in the Emergency Access GUI.
5. Click on the Board Restore button in the Emergency Access GUI. If the Emergency Access GUI does not have a Board Restore button, that means the unit is equipped with a physical Board Restore Button. Press the Board Restore Button with a thin pin or needle for more than 8 seconds. Wait until the unit is restarted and the Operational optical indicator is flashing at 0.5 Hz, before releasing the button.

## 3.2 Request and Import License Key File

License Key

File (LKF)

required for the integration is requested and obtained as a part of the preparation

activities.

This procedure applies to the manual licensing method. If Instantaneous Licensing in

connected mode is used, all the necessary licensing information is provided in the

configuration files to generate an LKF request during the integration process.

Alternatively, the radio node can be configured to use

IntegrationUnlock and Instantaneous Licensing will request

licenses after completed integration.

If Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode is used, license resources are

automatically granted for 21 days through IntegrationUnlock after

completed integration. The  Radio Node License Request flow

in ENM is then used to generate required LRF. The LRF must then be submitted to the

SSP-LKF Portal to generate an LKF for the target node. The LKF must be imported and

installed manually.

The use of multiple groupIds for EUFTs is supported in both modes

for node integration performed using IntegrationUnlock.

For more information on the licensing methods, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation

Codes.

For detailed descriptions of the import functionality and the installation wizard,

see Install Licenses Key Files tutorial in ENM Online Help.

Steps

1. Contact Ericsson Customer Unit to request and receive the License Key File.
2. Log on to ENM.
3. Open Software and Hardware Manager &gt; License Administration .
4. Import the License Key File using Import Key Files.

## 3.3 Create Configurations

### 3.3.3 Create Configurations Manually

Prepare configuration files and the integration project ZIP manually.

The following manual methods are described:

- Create Integration Project Manually describes creating an integration project from scratch.
- Create Configurations Manually Using a Modified Node Profile instructs how to manually modify a node profile generated in ECT to extend its scope

Manual preparation of an integration project requires competence in the following

fields:

- NETCONF and 3GPP Bulk CM formats: majority of the files use one of the two formats.
- Managed Object Model (MOM): the model is used as the source of object instances, attributes and actions that can be included in the configuration files.

The following documents provide additional information on the listed subjects:

- Managed Object Model (MOM) User Guide
- Ericsson NETCONF Interface
- Auto Provisioning user guide in the ENM Online Help library.
- The following user guides contain useful information on the MO classes related to different areas: Manage Transport Network Manage Hardware Equipment Manage IPsec Manage Radio Network Manage Network Synchronization

The CPI library contains a collection of example files that can be obtained in the

following ways:

- Downloading the files. For more information, see Example Configuration Files.
- Using the ap download command in ENM. For more information, see the Auto Provisioning user guide.

Even if the files are prepared without using the Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT), the

tool can still be used to validate a completed profile.

#### 3.3.3.1 Create Integration Project Manually

Create the configuration files manually and collect them in an integration project

ZIP file.

Steps

1. Create an empty project folder. A typical folder structure is shown in the example. Example [standard-project.zip] &gt; projectInfo.xml &gt; Node01 / nodeInfo.xml &gt; Node01 / SiteBasic.xml &gt; Node01 / SiteEquipment.xml &gt; Node01 / SiteInstallation.xml &gt; Node01 / BulkCm\_RN.xml &gt; Node01 / BulkCm\_TN.xml &gt; Node02 / nodeInfo.xml &gt; Node02 / SiteBasic.xml &gt; Node02 / SiteEquipment.xml &gt; Node02 / SiteInstallation.xml &gt; Node02 / Netconf\_RN.xml &gt; Node02 / Netconf\_TN.xml
![Image](../images/305_1543-LZA7016014_1Uen.CH33B/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Create the Project Information File: projectInfo.xml and place it on the top level of the project folder. For more information on the file and its contents, see the relevant article in ENM Online Help
4. Create a node folder for each node to be included in the project. The folder name must match the name of the node.
5. Create the Node Information File: nodeInfo.xml and place it in the node folder. For more information on the file and its contents, see the relevant article in ENM Online Help
6. Create node-specific configuration files and place them in the node folder. The list of mandatory and optional files is included in Table 6 Table 6 Integration Project Files File Tag Mandatory File Type Supported Formats Additional Information Site Installation siteInstallation Yes XML XML Manage Equipment Configuration Tool Site Basic siteBasic Yes XML NETCONF Site Equipment siteEquipment Yes XML NETCONF Node Configuration (RAT) nodeConfiguration No XML NETCONF, Bulk 3GPP Optional Features optionalFeature No XML NETCONF, Bulk 3GPP Baseline baseline No MOS MOSHELL Prepare Cells Unlock unlockCell No XML NETCONF, Bulk 3GPP Remote Node remoteNodeConfiguration No XML NETCONF, Bulk 3GPP License Request LicenseRequest No XML NETCONF, Bulk 3GPP
7. Add the license keys by copying the License Key File (LKF) ZIP file to each node folder. The licenseFile tag must be included in the nodeInfo.xml and must match the LKF file name.
8. Create the integration project ZIP file. The Project Information File and all node folders must be in the root folder of the ZIP.

##### 3.3.3.1.1 Site Installation File

For more information on the schema for the siteInstallation.xml

file, see BB Site Installation File, XSD.

The parameters marked &lt;!--ENM--&gt; in the schema are automatically filled in by ENM

once the integration project is imported.

##### 3.3.3.1.2 Site Basic File

The Site Basic file contains the configuration required for the node to establish

communication with ENM, except the Equipment configuration.

The file includes System Functions and Transport branches of the MOM, with the following

exceptions:

- Feature activation information is needed only for Transport licenses, which are required to establish communication with ENM. The remaining features are handled in the Optional Features file.
- Configuration of certificates, SNMP traps and LDAP is included in the OSS Node Protocol file that is prepared automatically by ENM. This configuration is excluded from the Site Basic file.

##### 3.3.3.1.3 Site Equipment File

The Site Equipment file contains Equipment configuration.

The file covers the Equipment branch of the MOM.

##### 3.3.3.1.4 Node Configuration File

The Node Configuration file contains all node configurations, which are not covered

in the other files.

Usually, one node configuration file is created for each Radio Access Technology

(RAT).

##### 3.3.3.1.5 Optional Features File

The Optional Features file contains feature activation information for all licensed

features.

Optional Features is a NETCONF or Bulk CM file, where each license to be activated is

represented by the following lines:

```
<FeatureState>
      <featureStateId>CXCXXXXX</featureStateId> <!-XXXXX replaced by the cxc number of the feature -- >
      <featureState>ACTIVATED</featureState>
</FeatureState>
```

##### 3.3.3.1.6 Baseline File

A baseline file is a MOSHELL script that can be included in the node folder of a node

integration project.

AMOS (.mos) is the supported file format. Multiple baseline files can be included in a

node folder. A baseline file is taken as a main script. A baseline file can

alternatively be placed in /home/shared/autoprovisioning folder on

the shared file system of the scripting server. The main script may call additional

scripts, these additional scripts must be in the shared folder.

##### 3.3.3.1.7 Prepare Cells Unlock File

The Unlock Cell file is an optional file that sets the administrative state of the

cell MOs to unlocked.

When included, the file is executed directly after the other configuration files, to open

the cell for traffic.

##### 3.3.3.1.8 Remote Node File

The Remote Node file is an optional file that provides delta configuration for

another node.

As an example, the file can be used to provide the delta configuration required for a

WCDMA RNC when adding a new NodeB, or the anchor configuration that needs to be applied

to an eNodeB when a new gNodeB in the NSA mode is added.

If the remote node is also a Radio Node, NETCONF can be used. If not, the 3GPP Bulk CM

format must be used.

##### 3.3.3.1.9 License Request File

A License Request File is needed for node integration if

IntegrationUnlock is not used and an integration LKF is requested

using SHM.

For further information on the file format and parameters, see the Request License

Key Files description in the Auto Provisioning guide in

ENM Online Help.

Example 1   Example License Request

```
<licenseRequest><radioAccessTechnologies>LTE,NR</radioAccessTechnologies><swltId>LCS_945587_10081</swltId><groupId>949525</groupId><hardwareType>BB6648</hardwareType></licenseRequest>
```

##### 3.3.3.1.10 Example Configuration Files

Several example configuration files are included in the CPI library.

Each example is contained in an Excel sheet and includes the following elements:

- A description of the example.
- The corresponding ECT node profile ZIP file, used to generate the files.
- The CIQ file used to generate the files.
- The resulting ENM AP integration project ZIP file containing all generated files.

The example files can be found under the following links:

- Example Configuration 1 - Node-Centric NR Low-Band ESS Non-Standalone
- Example Configuration 2 - Snapshot Expansion Adding NR Low-Band
- Example Configuration 3 - Cell-Centric LTE FDD, Including NB-IoT

- RDS Example Configuration 7 - Cell Centric with Dot Sharing and Cell Grouping

#### 3.3.3.2 Create Configurations Manually Using a Modified Node Profile

Use the Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT) to generate a node profile and modify it

manually.

The process is similar to creating an integration profile using ECT but contains an

additional step, in which the template files are manually edited, to extend their scope

beyond the options provided by ECT.

##### 3.3.3.2.1 Create Configuration Files From a Manually Modified Node Profile

Steps

1. Prepare the node profile using one of the following methods:
    - Use the ECT Configuration Generator to create a node profile that is as close to the desired configuration as possible. Select the node-centric CIQ mode.
    - Use the example configuration files included in the CPI library. Follow the links to access the example relevant to your deployment: Example Configuration 1 - Node-Centric NR Low-Band ESS Non-Standalone Example Configuration 2 - Snapshot Expansion Adding NR Low-Band Example Configuration 3 - Cell-Centric GSM, WCDMA, and LTE, Including NB-IoT Example Configuration 4 - Node-Centric NR Mid-Band Standalone
2. If an example configuration is used, follow the instructions relevant for the configuration in Instructions. Otherwise, go to step Step 3.
3. Unpack the contents of the node profile ZIP file. The following folder structure should be visible:
4. Delete the Basic Method Input and CIQ files in the top-level folder.
5. Modify the template files as required. Follow the links to learn more about the possible actions: Modify an Existing Template File Add a Template File Remove a Template File
6. Create a ZIP file with the updated content. The folder structure of the original ZIP file must be retained.
7. Upload and validate the ZIP in the ECT Configuration Files Handler. If errors are detected, correct the files and create the ZIP package again.
8. Download a CIQ template for a manually created profile in the ECT Configuration Files Handler.
9. Populate the CIQ file with node-specific data.
10. Create an integration project ZIP file in the ECT Configuration Files Handler, using the created profile and CIQ file. If errors are detected in the CIQ data, correct them and repeat the step.

###### 3.3.3.2.1.1 Modify an Existing Template File

Template files can be modified with an XML editor.

The template files are stored under the /template folder. Files are

updated by adding the required lines. The NETCONF User Guide and other documents listed

in Create Configurations Manually can help in the preparation of the files.

It is possible to add a new CIQ parameter as a part of the modification. The syntax of

(:myparametername:) is used. The example syntax of a line to

add a CIQ parameter for an attribute value is as follows:

```
<TheAttribute>(:myparametername:)</TheAttribute>
```

The template file must also contain a documentation comment for the parameter as

described below:

```
<!--Substitution variable="parameter name" area="area name" description="description for parameter"-->
```

The values indicated by the tags are added to the Area and

Description columns in the CSV file. When the substitution is

performed with the Configuration Files Handler, the tags for the substituted parameters

are removed from the configuration files.

Example 2   Adding Documentation Comments to Template Files

```
<NodeSupportxmlns="urn:com:ericsson:ecim:ReqNodeSupport"><nodeSupportId>1</nodeSupportId><MpClusterHandling><mpClusterHandlingId>1</mpClusterHandlingId><!--Substitution variable="parameterName"
area="area name"
description="description for parameterName"--><primaryCoreRef>(:parameterName:)</primaryCoreRef></MpClusterHandling></NodeSupport>
```

###### 3.3.3.2.1.2 Add a Template File

Steps

1. Create the template file using an XML editor. Tip: Use the NETCONF User Guide and other documents listed in Create Configurations Manually to help you prepare the files.
![Image](../images/305_1543-LZA7016014_1Uen.CH33B/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Add the file to list of configuration files specified in the Node Info file. For more information on the Node Info file, see the Auto Provisioning user guide.
4. Add the file to the validation order file stored under the /Validation folder. The files are listed in the order, in which they are to be validated. If a file depends on another file to be validated before, it needs to be placed in the right order. Example &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;ValidationOrder version="1.0"&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="preConfig" name="OssNodeProtocol.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="SiteEquipment.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="SiteBasic.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="FeatureActivation.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="LteRadioNetwork.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="LteCellUnlock.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="NrRadioNetwork.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="Netconf" type="template" name="NrCellUnlock.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="XML" type="template" name="SiteInstallation.xml"/&gt; &lt;File format="XML" type="template" name="NodeInfo.xml"/&gt; &lt;/ValidationOrder&gt; Each entry in the file has the following properties: Name The name of the file. Format Possible values: Netconf or XML The attribute specifies whether ECT shall validate the file as a Netconf file, with full validation of the MOM content, or whether it is just an XML file, in which case ECT only validates the XML syntax. Type Possible values: template or preConfig The value should normally be set to template. The preConfig value applies to files that are not included in the templates but have dependencies to the files in the templates, for example the OSS Node Protocol file that ENM AP automatically creates typically has MO relations to the Site Basics file. A template file need to be stored in the template files folder, while a preConfig file must exist as a stubbed version in the Validation files folder.

###### 3.3.3.2.1.3 Remove a Template File

Remove a file from the integration project.

Steps

1. Remove the file from the folder.
2. Delete the references to the removed file from the Node Info file and the Validation Order File.

3.3Create Configurations

## 3.4 Add Node IP to DHCP Server

If the DHCP configuration needs to be extended, follow the procedures and practices

applicable to your network setup. Because of the number of possible configurations,

detailed instructions are outside the scope of this instruction.

## 3.5 Order Integration

Integration is ordered through ENM Auto Provisioning (AP) application, or using ENM

CLI. The ordering method depends on the tool used to create configurations.

If the configuration files are prepared using the Configuration Generator in ENM AP,

integration is ordered in ENM AP, using the CIQ file containing node-specific data as

input.

If Equipment Configuration Tool (ECT) is used to generate the configuration files, or

files are prepared manually, integration is ordered either in ENM AP, or using ENM CLI.

In both cases, the integration profile ZIP file generated in ECT is used as input.

### 3.5.1 Order Integration Using CIQ in ENM Auto Provisioning

If the configuration files are created in the Configuration Generator in ENM Auto

Provisioning, integration is ordered by adding a node to a previously created

project.

Steps

1. Open ENM Auto Provisioning.

5. Open the Topology browser application in ENM and verify that the node is configured correctly.
6. Open the Alarm monitor application in ENM and verify that the node has no major alarms reported.
7. If additional information on the results of the defined health checks is required, open the Node Health Check application in ENM.

### 4.2.2 Unlock Cells

As the final step of the node integration, the cells must be unlocked to enable

traffic.

Unlocking can be done in a number of ways, including:

- ENM Cell Management Application
- ENM Network Explorer Application
- AMOS
- ENM CLI

If the unlock configuration is provided in the configuration files, the cells are

unlocked automatically during the autointegration.

For additional information and tutorials, see ENM Online Help.

### 4.2.3 Configure Licenses Using Instantaneous Licensing in Non-Connected Mode

If Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode is used, the LKF for the target node

must be handled manually using ENM and SSP-LKM after completed integration.

Prerequisites

- Integration is completed and Integration Unlock is triggered on the target node.

Steps

1. Log on to ENM.
2. Run the Radio Node License Request Flow to generate an LRF.
3. Submit the LRF to SSP-LKM to request a new LKF for the target node.
4. Download the generated LKF ZIP and upload it to ENM.
5. Open Software and Hardware Manager &gt; License Administration in ENM.
6. Import the LKF to the target node using Import Key Files.
7. Install the updated LKF on the target node.

### 4.2.4 Complementary Health Checks for Integration

Complementary health checks are used to verify the health status of a node after a

completed integration. Health checks can be performed in the following ways:

Node Health Check (NHC)

The NHC application enables the user to run node health status checks and generate

reports of such checks using ENM.

For more information, see ENM Online Help in ELEX.

Automated Health Check (AHC)

AHC provides health checks and diagnostics after a finished integration project using

ENM Flow Automation.

For more information, see Manage Automated Health Check.

Node Health Validator (NHV)

NHV in EMGUI provides node health status and health validation for troubleshooting,

or after hardware installation and replacement, using a client connected to the

node, or ENM.

For more information, see EMGUI Node Health Validator.

# 5 Integration Troubleshooting

## 5.1 Autointegration Failed

Troubleshooting is required to establish the exact cause of the failure and to act on

the problems.

Errors that occur during the autointegration process are shown in the Autointegration

Web GUI in a web browser or through the Ericsson Site Assistant application. For

more information, see Autointegration Web GUI.

Cause: Error during Autointegration

A validation error prevents the order procedure from completing.

Resolve Errors during Autointegration

1. Resolve the errors with the described solution and restart the autointegration process. Table 7 Most Common Errors during Autointegration Cause of Fault Solution The user does not have sufficient permissions to perform the operation. Check the file permissions of the Upgrade Package (UP) and the configuration files on the SFTP server. Mismatch between the UP/HAL metadata files and the UP. Check that the correct content is used in the UP. The SFTP server is unreachable. Check network connectivity, network configuration parameters, firewall, and server availability. The elementName element attribute attributeName is configured with a faulty value in the Site Installation File. Verify that the Site Installation File has correct element name and attribute value. The File.cxp does not exist on the specified path. Check if the file exists in the UP directory on the SFTP server. If not, repeat the preparation process for the autointegration process. Zipped UPs are not supported. Unzip the UP and change the file path to the unzipped directory in RbsSumarryFile. Loading failed. The file /rcs/networkloader/siteEquipmentFile.netconf\_nc.1. failed to parse Site Equipment file in transaction 1. This causes malformed XML. Check the Site Equipment file for any incorrect values or typos in the XML format and that the correct MO class is used in the Netconf file. If the error persists, export the logs so that Ericsson personnel can help to resolve it. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Autointegration WEB GUI.

## 5.2 Node Order Failed

An order may fail because of problems in the configuration files. Troubleshooting is

required to establish the exact cause of the failure and to act on the problems.

If an error occurs during node order, the node state is set to Order

Failed.

Cause: Error in the Configuration Files

A validation error prevents the order procedure from completing.

Resolve Validation Errors using ENM Log Viewer

1. Check the additional information section in the output of the ap status -n &lt;Node Name&gt; command to investigate the cause of the error. Output example:
ap status p

6. Resolve the errors in the configuration files. Note: This is a general troubleshooting procedure. Additional actions specific to the problem may be required.
7. Delete the node from the project and order the node again from the Auto Provisioning application or through CLI before attempting to order again.

## 5.3 AIWS Notification not Received

If the AP order is completed but the AIWS notification is not received, the

integration logs must be downloaded and analyzed to act on the problems.

Cause: Autointegration Errors

Resolve Autointegration Errors

1. Run the following command: ap status -n &lt;nodeName&gt;
2. Check if the Node Up Notification is Waiting and the AIWS notification is not received in the output. Example:
node up status

4. Click Download Network Loader logs in the Autointegration WEB GUI.
5. Send the logs to the Customer Unit for decryption and analysis.
6. Proceed with the troubleshooting based on the errors found in the previous step.

## 5.4 Unsupported or Misspelled MO Class in Project

Project

validation errors can be caused by typing an MO class incorrectly or by using an old

version of ECT.

Cause: Unsupported or Misspelled MO Class in Project

Resolve Validation Error

1. Import the project
2. Check the Validation Errors dialog that appears. Result: The error indicates an unsupported MO class.
3. Check if the spelling of the given MO is correct. If the spelling is incorrect, input the correct MO class name. If the spelling is correct, the ECT may be outdated and may not support the given MO class. The AP project must be run without validation.
4. Delete the old project file. Navigate to the Topology pane, select the project, and click on Delete.
5. Import and run the project again.
