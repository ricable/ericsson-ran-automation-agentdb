# 2 Remedy Action for AntennaNearUnit: Antenna near unit controller occupied

The No Connection alarm is raised on an antenna near unit because of either loss of

connection or inability to establish it.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Restart the radio unit serving the AntennaNearUnit TOOLTIPFLAG.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Check that cables are attached according to appropriate document in the RBS Antenna Systems Library in the RBS Site Product folder.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Replace the faulty equipment according to the appropriate documentation in the RBS Antenna Systems Library in the RBS Site Product folder. Note: In case a cascaded RET unit is to be replaced, the uniqueId TOOLTIPFLAG attribute in the AntennaNearUnit TOOLTIPFLAG MO needs to be updated to match the unique Id of the new RET. If the faulty RET is part of an AIR unit, the whole AIR must be replaced in accordance with Replacing Antenna Integrated Radio Units. The AISG device scan procedure helps to find the uniqueId TOOLTIPFLAG as it scans all the RF and RET ports in the RBS and lists all the available AISG units with their unique hardware IDs. For more information about the device scan procedure, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Reinsert the original hardware and consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for Cabinet: Affected External Node &lt;fullDistingushedName, MO ExternalNode&gt;.

The No Connection alarm is raised when the smoke detector in the cabinet is

disconnected. The result is that it is not possible to detect any smoke or fire in

the cabinet.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Restart remotely the SCU. See Manage Hardware Equipment or Restart Board for instructions.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Connect the smoke detector to the SCU.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for EcBus

The No Connection alarm is raised in a multicabinet configuration when communication

with other cabinets is problematic, broken, or lost. The result is that the node is

not able to control and supervise the support system functions in other

cabinets.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check that the EcBus TOOLTIPFLAG MO is configured properly using the ecBusConnectorRef TOOLTIPFLAG attribute.

Check if there is a cable-related problem between the DU or Baseband unit and the Field Replaceable Unit to which connection to the EC Bus is established: If a cable is missing, connect a new cable. If a cable is disconnected, reconnect the loose ends. If a cable is physically damaged, replace it with a new cable. If a cable looks dirty, clean the connections in both ends of the cable. (Disconnect the cable, use a suitable cleaning kit to clean the connectors, and reconnect the cable.)

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Action for EquipmentSupportFunction, ExternalNode

The No Connection alarm is raised when the

secondary

role node does not have contact with the

the needs of the

secondary

role node. There is a risk of overheating and reduced

performance.

The following steps can only be done on site:

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the number of the ExternalNode MO that references MO EquipmentSupportFunction with supportSystemControl set to TRUE and verify that the number is consistent with the number of installed secondary role nodes.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Check that the primary and secondary role nodes are referring to each other. Option Description Primary and secondary role nodes are connected through an EC bus: Check that the attribute EcPort.hubPosition (of the ExternalNode MO) in the primary role node has the same value as attribute EcPort.hubPosition (of the Baseband unit FieldReplaceableUnit MO) in the corresponding secondary role node. Primary and secondary role nodes are connected through a CPRI and a shared intermediate unit: Check that the attribute ExternalNode.inciConnectorRef in the primary and secondary role nodes refer to the MO representing the corresponding shared unit.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Check that the primary role node attribute EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl is set to TRUE. Correct it, if necessary.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

5. Check that the secondary role node attribute EquipmentSupportFunction.supportSystemControl is set to FALSE. Correct it, if necessary.

6. Check that the primary role node Baseband unit and the secondary role node Baseband unit are properly connected to the CPRI or EC bus hub, or to the SHU, according to Non-RF Connections or Transmission Connections, depending on the node type. Check that there is no cable-related problem: If a cable is missing, connect a new cable. If a cable is disconnected, reconnect the loose ends. If a cable is physically damaged, replace it with a new cable. If a cable looks dirty, clean the connections in both ends of the cable. (Disconnect the cable, use a suitable cleaning kit to clean the connectors, and reconnect the cable.)

If the alarm remains, do the following:

7. Reinstall the original cables and hub.
8. Restart the secondary role node, as instructed in Manage Hardware Equipment.

The No Connection alarm is raised if the PDU controller in a modular PDU loses

contact with any of the active E-fuses. The alarm is raised on the

PlugInModule that contains the E-fuse. The PDU controller is

not able to communicate with the E-fuse or control the E-fuse. The E-fuse unit can

work in autonomous mode.

# 9 Remedy Action for SupportUnit

The No Connection alarm is raised when there is no

contact with a support unit that is expected to be present in the node. The node is

not able to communicate with the support unit. Support units work in autonomous

mode, but loss of contact results in lack of supervision.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check that the support unit is properly connected to its host units.
