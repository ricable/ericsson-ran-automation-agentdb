# 1 Descriptions

This document describes the Baseband Radio Node in a radio network

for GSM and its management.

## 1.1 Introduction

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 1   Baseband Radio Node in a GSM RAN

Figure 1 shows a GSM RAN that contains

Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node, STN, Abis Transport Network, BSC,

and OSS. DU Radio Node and STN are not in the scope of this document.

The traffic functionality is handled through the BSC, which connects

to the Baseband Radio Node through an Abis Transport Network. Hardware

management, software management, some parts of the synchronization,

initial setup, and configuration of the node are handled through the

OSS.

This document describes the basic functions and concepts of the

GSM part in the Baseband Radio Node and instructions for configuration

of GSM Sector, TRX and sector equipment function in the Baseband MOM.

Detailed function, concept and configurations are described in

the separate documents:

- Baseband Description in hardware CPI library
- User Description, Baseband Radio Node for GSM, User Description in GSM RAN CPI library
- GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management, Feature Description in GSM RAN CPI library
- Manage GSM Abis Transport, User Guide
- MCPA Guideline, Recommendations in GSM RAN CPI library
- Node Description, Description
- Radio Node Configurations, Description, in hardware CPI library
- User Description, Combined Cell, User Description in GSM RAN CPI library

## 1.2 GSM Managed Object Models

The GSM O&amp;M part of the radio node consists of two managed

object models:

- Abis O&amp;M BTS Logical Model G31 - referred to as Abis G31
- Managed Object Model (MOM) - common for all RATs

Abis G31 is used for communication between the BSC and the BTS.

Abis G31 model and the MOM are two separate models but have strong

MO dependencies.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 2   MOM and Abis G31 Model Dependencies

Abis G31 model consists of the following Managed Objects (MOs):

- Transceiver Group (TG)
- Sector Central Functions (SCF)
- Timing Function (TF)
- Abis Transport (AT)
- Transceiver Controller (TRXC)
- Transmitter (TX)
- Time Slot (TS)
- Receiver (RX)

Abis MO SCF is the parent MO to TF and AT which are configured

and activated from the BSC.

Abis MO SCF handles information common to all ABIS MO TRXC Instances.

It also handles information regarding the TRXC when the TRXC itself

is unable to communicate with the BSC.

Abis MO TF handles timing and synchronization functionality for

all TRXs in the GSM Sector. TF needs to be enabled before TX, RX and

TS can be enabled.

Abis MO AT handles the transport bundling to the TRXs, both for

control signaling and payload.

The MOM consists of the following GSM specific MOs:

- BtsFunction
- GsmSector
- Trx
- AbisIp

The MO BtsFunction is the Top MO of

the GSM branch in the MOM.

The MO GsmSector in the MOM handles

attributes corresponding to TG, SCF, TF and AT in Abis G31. The GSM

Sector also handles information common to all TRXs in the GSM Sector,

like PM information.

The MO Trx in the MOM handles attributes

corresponding to TRXC, TS, TX and RX in the Abis G31.

Each MO GsmSector must have one corresponding

Sector TG defined in BSC.

In BSC, the Sector TGs are independent of each other. The MO AbisIp needs to be defined and unlocked in each GSM

Sector, and establishes SCF OML connection to BSC on the L2TP tunnel,

see Manage GSM Abis Transport.

### 1.2.1 GSM
Managed Object Models for Combined Cell

For the feature Combined Cell, the ExtTrx MO class is a child MO of the Trx MO

class.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 3   MOM and Abis G31 Model Dependencies for the feature Combined

Cell

The total traffic capacity of a combined cell is the same as the

parent TRX. This means that the extension TRX is only used to provide

additional coverage and no extra traffic capacity, and the extension

TRXs use the same TRXC, TS, TX and RX as the TRX.

For the feature Combined Cell, BSC does not control extension TRXs.

The TRXC from BSC perspective are handled as regular ABIS MO TRXC.

For more Combined Cell information, see  Combined Cell with

Multiple Antenna Sites and GSM RAN CPI User

Description, Combined Cell. For more MO ExtTrx information, see  Introduction

to Extension TRX.

## 1.3 Introduction to GSM Sector

A GSM Sector is a geographical area with GSM functionality. Different Trx MO instances in the GSM Sector can have different

power levels defined to support over-laid and under-laid sub-cells.

The radio and antenna equipment are grouped into one or more SectorEquipmentFunction MO instances in the Baseband

MOM. A SectorEquipmentFunction MO instance

is single-band. A GSM Sector can via different Trx MO instances use resources from different SectorEquipmentFunction MO instances to support dual-band and other radio configurations.

The SectorEquipmentFunction MO instances

must have the same antenna location and direction to support dual

band. However, a Trx MO instance is single-band

and connected to one SectorEquipmentFunction MO instance.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 4   Baseband Radio Node MOM for GSM

Figure 4 shows the Managed

Object (MO) classes used to configure the GSM part of Baseband Radio

Node in the Baseband MOM.

A GSM Sector (MO GsmSector) must be

mapped to one sector TG in BSC.

The transport-related data is configured in the AbisIp MO.

The BSC handles the GSM cells. The maximum number of TRX supported

by a baseband unit is divided into groups of 12 TRXs. One, two or

four groups are supported depending on HW and if Mixed Mode Baseband

is used. However, the BSC automatically groups TGs from the same Baseband

Radio Node to create a bigger cell with more than 12 TRXs. For more

information, see  Number of GSM Sectors

and Number of Trx per GSM Sector in Baseband Radio Node.

The GsmSector MO in the MOM handles

attributes corresponding to TG, Sector Central Function (SCF), Timing

Function (TF), and Abis Transport (AT) managed objects in the Abis

G31 model.

Abis MO SCF is the parent MO to TF and AT which are configured

and activated from the BSC.

Abis MO SCF handles information common to all ABIS MO TRXC Instances.

It also handles information regarding the TRXC when the TRXC itself

is unable to communicate with the BSC.

Abis MO SCF handles node exchange information between the SCF and

the TG in the BSC. Also, Abis MO SCF handles calendar time exchange

information between SCF and the TG in the BSC, which is useful when

matching logs from BSC and the Baseband Radio Node. However, the BSC

uses local time, the Baseband Radio Node uses Universal UTC time.

When MO AbisIp is unlocked, establish

the SCF OML to BSC, see Manage GSM Abis Transport.

Abis MO SCF needs to be started by the BSC before the BSC can start,

configure and enable Abis MO TF and AT.

Abis MO TF handles timing and synchronization functionality for

all TRXs in the GSM Sector. TF needs to be enabled before TX, RX and

TS can be enabled.

Abis MO AT handles the transport bundling to the TRXs, both for

control signaling and payload.

## 1.4 Introduction
to TRX

The Trx MO represents a GSM TRX and

corresponding functionality for a GSM carrier on the air interface.

GSM uses narrowband (&lt; 200 kHz bandwidth) channels in the air interface

(one downlink and one uplink) handled by one TRX. A TRX normally uses

two uplink streams from respective antenna for RX diversity and one

downlink stream for TX. However other combinations are possible, see  4-way RX Diversity,  One-way RX, No Diversity and  Combined Cell, TX Delay

Diversity.

The Trx MO class is a child MO to the GsmSector MO class.

A Trx MO is also connected to one SectorEquipmentFunction MO which represents the radio

and antenna equipment.

The parameter ranges for the Trx MO

in the MOM must be set properly to be consistent with the BSC parameters

for the associated cell and installed equipment. To allow the BSC

to change parameter values (based on a re-planning in a long term

perspective) the following attributes can be extended (within some

limits) compared to what initially are used by the BSC.

- Power attributes for the Trx can be set to be a higher value compared what the BSC initially uses but not higher than the hardware capability and HWACs.
- The frequency range can be set to a wider frequency bandwidth compared to what initially is used by the BSC but not wider than the hardware capability of the supported IBW of the MCPA in the radio.

The frequency range specified by arfcnMin and arfcnMax must be

within the limit of the IBW of the MCPA in the radio, and therefore,

a GSM Sector with large ARFCN range or in other way having ARFCNs

far apart need Trx MOs connected to different

MCPAs or radios. This require special consideration for the frequency

planning in the BSC using different hopping groups for the TRXs using

different MCPAs.

BSC is informed through SCF OML when a TRX is created and unlocked

in the Baseband Radio node. When the TRX is unlocked, the BSC automatically

allocates the TRXC resources in the BSC and in the Baseband Radio

Node the TRXC resources are allocated accordingly.

When the TRX is unlocked, the Baseband Radio Node automatically

updates the bundling groups and informs the BSC per GSM Sector over

Abis MO AT about the available TRX and establishes needed transport

sessions for the TRX. After that the TRXC OML and TRX RSL links can

be established on the transports sessions, initiated by the BSC.

When the first TRX in the Node is unlocked, the radio node starts

a resource pre-allocation routine, where resources are reserved to

all defined TRXs. The best result of this pre-allocation routine is

achieved if all required Trx MO instances

in the Baseband Radio Node are defined before the first TRX is unlocked.

If the radio node raises a Resource Allocation Failure alarm on

the TRX MO, then lock all TRX instances in the Node, and then unlock

all TRX instances in the Node to repeat the resource allocation routine

and recover from this fault. See also OPI Resource Allocation Failure.

When the TRX is unlocked, the Baseband Radio Node allocates resources

for the TRX and BSC initiates RF transmission of mandatory common

channels on the air interface. The following are prerequisites for

the RF transmission to start:

- Resources are allocated to the TRX
- Abis MO AT is configured and enabled
- TRXC OML and RSL links are established
- TRXC is started
- All TRXC MOs TX, RX and eight TS are started, configured, and enabled by the BSC

## 1.5 Number of GSM
Sectors and Number of Trx per GSM Sector in Baseband Radio Node

Each GSM Sector needs to have a corresponding TG in the BSC; there

is a one to one mapping of GSM Sector and TG.

There can be 1-12 TRXs per GSM Sector and TG.

It is also important to plan ahead the long term number of TRX

needed in the Baseband Radio Node as resource allocation of all configured

TRX is made when the first TRX is unlocked; TRX not needed for the

moment can remain locked.

The TRX uses resources in the Baseband unit and one radio unit

and must have reference to the appropriate SectorEquipmentFunction to ensure that the radio is connected to the correct antennas. The

Baseband resources and radio resources are pooled in the Baseband

Radio Node and they can be semi-dynamically allocated to the TRX.

The maximum number of the TRXs and the GSM Sectors supported by

the Baseband Unit HW can be divided into 1-4 groups of 12 TRXs in

the Baseband Unit. Certain configuration requires special resource

allocation, where one or more GsmSector MO instances need to be split or merged. For example: 1 GsmSector instance with 8 Trx instances can be split into two groups with 4 Trx instances per group. 3 GsmSector instances

with 8 Trx instances per sector require

two groups with 12 Trx instances per group,

see  Figure 5  for more details.

Note:  The Abis TG in the BSC also needs

to be split to match the GsmSector.

General rule for cells with more than 12 Trx MO instances, make one or more GsmSector MO instances with 12 Trx MO instances

and then the remainder of Trx MO instances

into a separate GsmSector MO instance.

For more information, see Radio Node Configurations, Manage Hardware Equipment, and GSM RAN CPI User Description, Baseband Radio

Node for GSM.

WCDMA  baseband software resets itself when GSM baseband restart

happens in the following configurations:

- W + G on Baseband 6621
- L + W + G on Baseband 6631

## 1.6 Introduction to Extension TRX

The ExtTrx MO represents a GSM extension

TRX and corresponding functionality for the extension antenna site

part of Combined Cell configuration.

The ExtTrx MO in the MOM handles the

configuration of extension TRXs, operational state and availability

status, alarms and pmCounters on extension TRXs.

For the feature Combined Cell, adding ExtTrx MO to Trx MO can provide good coverage.

The ExtTrx MO class is a child MO of the Trx MO class, an ExtTrx MO

is single-band and also connected to one SectorEquipmentFunction MO which represents the radio and antenna equipment for the extension

antenna site. The extension TRX must support the same Frequency Band

and Frequency Ranges as the parent TRX.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 6   Baseband Radio Node MOM for GSM for the feature Combined

Cell

Each GSM sector has one or more parent TRXs, and each parent TRX

must have the same number of extension TRXs in the same GSM Sector.

Each extension TRX only have one parent TRX.

The ExtTrx MO has some attributes

inherit from the Trx MO, and these attributes are

shown below:

- Trx.noOfRxAntennas
- Trx.noOfTxAntennas
- Trx.frequencyBand
- Trx.arfcnMin
- Trx.arfcnMax

The ExtTrx MO also has its own attributes,

and these attributes are shown below:

- ExtTrx.operationalState
- ExtTrx.availabilityStatus
- ExtTrx.sectorEquipmentFunctionRef
- ExtTrx.configuredMaxTxPower
- ExtTrx.reservedMaxTxPower
- ExtTrx.maxTxPowerCapabilty
- ExtTrx.rfBranchRx
- ExtTrx.rfBranchRxRef
- ExtTrx.rfBranchTx
- ExtTrx.rfBranchTxRef
- ExtTrx.extTrxId
- ExtTrx.userLabel
- ExtTrx.extTrxDistance
- ExtTrx.extTrxRadius
- ExtTrx.antSiteIndex

The BSC can configure the bscMaxTxPower for the parent TRX in OML to change the TX Power, but extension

TRX use configuredMaxTxPower as the nominal

power value for the ExtTrx MO and the BSC

can not change the value.

Up to seven ExtTrx MO instances can

be created per parent Trx.

The ExtTrx MO can be deleted when its

parent Trx MO is locked.

The MO attributes of ExtTrx MO can be

updated when its parent Trx MO is locked.

The maximum number of TRX supported by a baseband unit is divided

into groups of 12 TRXs. One, two or four groups are supported depending

on HW and if Mixed Mode Baseband is used. When the TRXs and the extension

TRXs use 1TX/1RX RF branch and 1RX/2RX RF branches, 12 MO Trx instances are used, 28 MO ExtTrx instances can be added in a group and give a grand total of 40.

If the number of MO Trx instances are reduced,

more MO ExtTrx instances can be added up

to the limit of 40. For the possible TRX with 1TX2RX resource allocation

for Combined Cell, see table below.

Note:  For more Combined Cell configurations, see  Appendix A.

(1)  In the

Mixed Mode Baseband, when the other RAT needs more RX RF branches

and TX RF branches, the number of TRXs and extension TRXs needs to

be reduced.

All parent TRXs and extension TRXs in same GSM sector for Combined

Cell support same number of TX branches and same number of RX branches.

Combined cell configurations can be created using more than one

GSM Sector for the serving cell in the BSC. One reason can be to create

bigger configuration, the other reason can be to split a combined

cell configuration to fit into the TRX groups. Each GSM Sector must

have a matching TG in the BSC.

Example how to increase the capacity: 4x4+4x8=4x12.

Example how to split the GSM Sectors: 3 sectors with 3x8 needs

to be split into 4 GSM Sectors to fit into two TRX groups: 3x8+(3x4+3x4)+3x8.

Radio Cascading is supported together with the feature Combined

Cell. There can be up to six radio units in a cascade chain and it

is recommended that the radio units used by the same GSM sector are

cascaded.

For more Combined Cell information, see  Combined Cell with

Multiple Antenna Sites and GSM RAN CPI User

Description, Combined Cell.

## 1.7 Creating and Recovering GSM MOs

General information on creating and recovering GSM MOs:

- The maximum number of allowed MO instances must not be exceeded. Attempts to create an MO instance when the limit is reached will be aborted and the instance will not be created.

- To modify the attributes of a TRX or an extension TRX, make sure that attribute administrativeState of MO Trx is in state LOCKED.

## 1.8 Detect, Recover From, and Report
GSM Faults

TRX faults and other GSM faults are handled in the same manner

as other Baseband Radio Node faults with the addition that the GSM

part also can perform:

- Abis Auto Recovery
- GSM Traffic Restart
- GSM RAT Restart

Abis Auto Recovery is the first recovery action, done automatically

by the RBS. See  Automatic

Recovery of an Abis MO for more information.

GSM Traffic Restart can recover a group of up to 12 TRXs, thus

resolving software related problems faster, by resetting the affected

TRXs only. During the GSM Traffic Restart, BSC detects a link break

towards the TRXs, however Abis MO SCF will be degraded with Operational

Condition "TRXC internal Fault".

GSM RAT Restart is automatically performed when an error related

to the GSM programs is detected, without disturbing the other coexisting

RATs. During the GSM RAT restart, the active alarm of the GSM RAT

is cleared. GSM-related PM counters and events are lost during the

GSM RAT restart. GSM RAT restart is logged in AVLI log.

If all these recoveries are unsuccessful, the node escalates to

a Warm Restart. See  Automatic Recovery of an Abis MO and Manage Faults for more information.

In addition to the above, the GSM parts of the radio node is responsible

for sending alarms directly to OSS over the Mu interface and Abis

MO operational conditions to BSC over the Abis interface. The GSM

Baseband Radio Node is however unaware of the status of the GSM Cell

so it is the BSC that is responsible for sending alarms on GSM cell

level to OSS.

The GSM part of Baseband Radio Node is designed to keep the BSC

up to date at all times of the status of the Abis MOs with respect

to what is working and what is not. This is achieved by sending operational

condition messages to BSC, for the particular MO, over the OML link.

Operational condition status can be read in the MOM. There is one

attribute for each Abis MO.

The following attributes are present in MOM under gsmSector MO:

- abisScfOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO SCF
- abisAtOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO AT
- abisTfOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO TF

The following attributes are present in MOM under Trx MO:

- abisTrxcOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO TrxTOOLTIPFLAG
- abisTxOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO TX
- abisRxOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO RX
- abisTsOperConditionTOOLTIPFLAG to indicate the operational condition of Abis MO TS

The following is three Abis MO operational conditions:

- Operational means that the Abis MO performs full functionality
- Degraded means that the Abis MO performs some functionality but reduced or degraded performance can be expected
- Not Operational means that the Abis MO is unable to perform its functionality

For information about TRXC operational conditions, see  TRX Availability State Relation to TRXC

Operational Condition.

General fault handling is described in Manage Faults.

A list of system alarms are found in Alarm List.

Alarm instructions related to the alarms are found in Alarm Instructions folder of CPI library.

### 1.8.1 TRX Availability
State Relation to TRXC Operational Condition

A TRXC normally consist of one DL carrier branch for TX and two

UL carrier branches for RX. However, other configurations are supported,

see  One-way RX, No Diversity,  4-Way RX Diversity and  Combined Cell, TX Delay

Diversity. The Abis TRXC Operational condition shows an aggregated

view of the subordinate Abis MO Operational conditions.

The BSC can use RX and TX resources from different TRXCs if there

is more than one TRXC in the TG, and therefore the TRXC is only degraded

even if RX or TX is Not Operational.

If the radio node detects a state change on one or several carrier

branches for a GSM TRX, the applicable Trx MO attributes are updated, and the BSC is informed about status

update with appropriate operational condition for the corresponding

TRXC, TX, RX or TS.

The following table describes relations between

- Trx.availabilityStatusTOOLTIPFLAG and Trx.operationalStateTOOLTIPFLAG.
- Abis MOs TRXC, TX, RX and TS operational conditions.

#### 1.8.1.1 TRX and Extension TRX Availability State Relation
to TRXC Operational Condition for Combined Cell

For the feature Combined Cell, the operational condition handling

for one parent TRX with one or several extension TRXs in the same

GSM Sector has some special operational condition relations. If the

radio node detects a state change on one or several carrier branches

for a GSM TRX or extension TRXs, the applicable Trx MO attributes or ExtTrx MO attributes

are updated, and the BSC is informed about status update with appropriate

operational condition for the corresponding TRXC, TX, RX or TS.

The state propagation to BSC is based on both parent TRX and extension

TRXs.

- TRXC is Operational only if the parent TRX and all the extension TRXs are Operational and have operationalState = ENABLED and availabilityStatus = &lt;empty&gt;.
- The parent TRX and extension TRXs causes TRXC to be NOT OPERATIONAL in cases related to:
    - Licensing and HWAC
    - Incorrect configuration
    - Common Baseband resources of Trx MO and ExtTrx MO
- For Combined Cell Type 1 and Type 2, the parent TRX is more important than extension TRXs, if operationalState of the parent TRX is DISABLED, the TRXC is NOT OPERATIONAL.
- For Combined Cell Type 3 and Type 4, if operationalState of the parent TRX is DISABLED but at least one extension TRX is working, the TRXC is DEGRADED.
- If the parent TRX is degraded, the TRXC is degraded.
- Other faults affecting one or more ExtTrx MO instances cause TRXC to be Degraded regardless if the operationalState of ExtTrx is DISABLED or operationalState of ExtTrx is ENABLED with availabilityStatus is DEGRADED.

The following tables describe some relations between:

- Trx.availabilityStatusTOOLTIPFLAG and Trx.operationalStateTOOLTIPFLAG
- ExtTrx.availabilityStatusTOOLTIPFLAG and ExtTrx.operationalStateTOOLTIPFLAG
- Abis MOs TRXC, TX, RX and TS operational conditions.

## 1.9 Automatic Recovery of an Abis MO

For certain faults, the GRAT performs one or more of the following

automatic recovery actions:

- Abis MO Restart
- RAT Traffic Restart
- GSM RAT Restart

If all these restarts are unsuccessful, the node escalates to a

Warm Restart as shown in  Figure 7. For more information, see Manage Faults.

The following auto recovery actions exist:

- TRXC Auto Recovery
- TS Auto Recovery
- TF Auto Recovery
- GSM Traffic Restart for 12 TRXs
- GSM RAT Restart

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 7   GSM Auto Recovery

An automatic recovery of an Abis MO is carried out in the following

steps:

- Radio node detects a fault which will affect one or more Abis MOs.
- The affected MOs send Status Update to BSC with Operational Condition = Not Operational.
- If appropriate, the Baseband Radio Node waits 5 seconds to allow the BSC to move traffic from affected TRXs and disable TX on all affected TRXCs.
- Any remaining traffic on the affected TRXs is lost.
- Radio node auto disables indirectly affected Abis MOs.
- Radio node sends Status Update to BSC on all indirectly affected Abis MOs.
- Radio node performs Automatic Recovery action of the affected MO.
- The affected MO send Status Update to BSC with MO State = Reset and Operational Condition = Operational.
- Radio node updates all GsmSector MO attributes to reflect the new states for the Abis MOs.
- Use Case ends.

### 1.9.1 Automatic Recovery of an Abis MO, Combined Cell

For the feature Combined Cell, the Baseband Radio Node will automatically

try to recover the extension TRX; either individually or together

with parent TRX and other extension TRXs depending on which fault

it is.

## 1.10 Physical Channel Handling

The Physical Channel Handling function covers the traffic services

provided by the physical layer in the radio node for the air interface.

Sub-functions

The following types of channels for Channel Coding (uplink and

downlink), Interleaving (downlink) and Deinterleaving (uplink) are

available in compliance with 3GPP 45.003:

- Traffic channels
- Control channels
- Packet-switched channels

The following sub-functions are available in compliance with 3GPP

45.002:

- Burst Assembly The sub-function regards the following types of bursts:
    - Traffic channels
    - Control channels
    - Packet-switched channels
- Multiplexing This sub-function is used for multiplexing bursts into Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frames.

## 1.11 Broadcast Control Channel Carrier
Filling

The transmitter must be configured for a fixed Absolute Radio Frequency

Channel Number (ARFCN).

The output power for a transmitter sending the BCCH frequency is

constant and equal to the nominal output power, except for the power

ramping between bursts. Dummy bursts (3GPP:45.002) are transmitted

during idle time slots.

BCCH Power Saving can reduce the BTS power level for time slots

on the BCCH carrier except for time slots configured as Broadcast

channels, see Reduced Power Consumption

in GSM RAN.

The BCCH carrier filling function is initiated by a Tx\_Configuration\_Request command, when the Filling

Marker is set to filling.

## 1.12 Radio Reception

The TRX receives a Radio Frequency (RF) signal from a Mobile Station

(MS) or User Equipment (UE) on the air interface. First, the signal

is filtered to isolate the targeted MS signal from other transmission,

then the signal is amplified and finally demodulated. In the demodulation

phase the bit stream that constitutes a burst is restored.

For the radio reception function to be used, the Air Time Slot

Resource (ATSR) must be enabled. Radio reception is initiated only

when the ATSR is in traffic. Reception terminates when the ATSR is

taken out of traffic.

With the attribute Trx.noOfRxAntennas, both RX diversity and no diversity are configured by specifying

the number of RX RF branches.

The following applies:

- 4-Way RX Diversity must have four RX branches.
- 2-way RX Diversity must have two RX branches.
- 1-way RX, No Diversity must have one RX branch.

## 1.13 RX Diversity

The diversity function is used to improve the sensitivity of the

Receiver (RX). It is achieved by using two or more antennas, thus

taking advantage of two or more RX paths. Diversity can be used to

improve performance on received signal. This can be achieved by using

two or more reception channels that are independently influenced by

fading.

To start the diversity function, the Baseband Radio Node must be

configured for at least two RX antennas used by the TRX, and Abis

MO RX must be enabled.

Note:  It is highly recommended to use RX Path Imbalance Supervision

when the features Voice Services over Adaptive Multiuser Channels

on One Slot (VAMOS) and Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) are

active, because these features are dependent on RX Diversity.

### 1.13.1 2-Way RX Diversity

When the Baseband Radio Node is configured for 2-Way RX Diversity,

the receiver combines the two signals from the antennas, as shown

in the following figure:

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 8   2-Way Receiver Diversity

The receiver combines the signals proportionally, according to

the signal-to-noise ratio of each antenna.

### 1.13.2 4-Way RX Diversity

4-Way Receiver Diversity provides an increased diversity gain and

enhanced radio coverage of RBS sites. This significantly decreases

the number of sites required, so the cost of the network is reduced.

4-Way RX Diversity is particularly beneficial when new areas are covered,

or in existing networks coverage gaps are bridged using available

sites, for example indoor coverage, or coverage over sea from coastline

sites. Also, the feature enhances voice quality and data throughput

for the end user, and leads to longer battery time in UE and MS by

reducing power consumption.

To provide the optimal coverage enhancement, it is recommended

to improve the RF signal strength for both uplink and downlink. 4-Way

RX Diversity increases the uplink RF signal strength. Increased downlink

output power can be achieved by increasing the output power, or using

the TX Delay Diversity feature.

Note:  When 4-Way RX Diversity is used together with TX Delay Diversity,

maximum 42 TRXs can be used in the Baseband Radio Node.

4-Way RX Diversity requires four receiver paths, so that the cells

in the sector must be equipped with a radio with four RX antennas

or two radios with two RX antennas each.

When the Baseband Radio Node is configured for 4-Way RX Diversity,

the receiver combines the four signals from the antennas, as shown

in the following figure:

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 9   4-Way Receiver Diversity

The receivers combine signals proportionally according to the signal-to-noise

ratio of each antenna.

If cross-polarized antennas are used, it is important in which

order the antennas are connected. The order of antenna connection

affects performance directly. For more information see  Connect TRX to Antennas.

Limitations

- RRUS 32 and AIR 32 do not support 4-Way RX Diversity.
- EC-GSM-IoT function cannot be used together with 4-Way RX Diversity.
- If the TRX is configured for 4-Way RX Diversity, but less than three RX branches are working, TRXC does not support VAMOS or IRC.
- Combined Cell with multiple antenna sites is not supported with 4-Way RX Diversity.
- 4-Way RX Diversity and Combined Cell with multiple antenna sites can not be used together in the same Baseband Radio Node.

## 1.14 RX Diversity Supervision

The Diversity Supervision function supervises the Signal Strength

Imbalance (SSI) between the two diversity channels in an RBS with

receiver diversity. The supervision is automatically enabled if the

receiver equipment is configured for diversity.

The RX Diversity Supervision makes it possible to detect major

faults on a long term basis. The function uses long term signal strength

measurement.

Note:  It is highly recommended to use RX Path Imbalance Supervision

when the features Voice Services over Adaptive Multiuser Channels

on One Slot (VAMOS) and Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) are

active, because these features are dependent on RX Diversity.

If the Transceiver (TRX) is configured for 2-Way RX Diversity,

the function supervises the imbalance pairwise between antenna A and

B. If the TRX is configured for 4-Way RX Diversity, the function supervises

the imbalance pairwise between any two antennas of antenna A, B, C

or D. It is also capable of detecting major faults in one of the radio

receiver paths or the receiver antenna system.

The signal strengths of the two diversity channels in one antenna

pair are measured and compared after the signals have passed through

the radio receiver equipment and an imbalance in signal strength between

the receiver paths is detected for one or more TRXs.

For information about RX Diversity fault handling, see RX Diversity Lost.

## 1.15 RX Path Imbalance Supervision

RX Path Imbalance Supervision is an optional feature that complements

RX Diversity Supervision.

The RX Path Imbalance Supervision function supervises the signal

strength imbalance between RX paths over a specified period of time,

using a sliding window. The alarm threshold and the sliding window

time can be configured using the following MO attributes of Trx:

- rxImbSupWindowSizeTOOLTIPFLAG, the time over which the RX path imbalance value is averaged.
- rxImbMinNoOfSamplesTOOLTIPFLAG, the minimum required number of samples within the supervision window.
- rxImbAlarmThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG, the threshold of imbalance between the RX branches.Note: If the rxImbAlarmThresholdTOOLTIPFLAG for a TRX is configured to the highest value 255, RX Branch Imbalance fault is not raised on this TRX.

For the supervision to be active at least two RX branches must

be enabled and the parameters rxImbSupWindowSize, rxImbMinNoOfSamples, andrxImbAlarmThreshold must be configured.

The RX Path Imbalance Supervision makes it possible to quickly

detect minor degradations in the antenna system, which can have a

negative impact on traffic performance. The function enables both

short term and long term signal quality measurements.

To achieve reliable measurements, the setting of the attributes rxImbMinNoOfSamples and rxImbSupWindowSize must be adjusted

to the traffic on the given cell. The higher number of samples increases

the accuracy of the measurement, and the wider time window increases

the probability of a successful measurement period. If the window

size is too small in relation to the required number of samples, the

measurement is unsuccessful, so no alarm is raised and no result is

shown. So, for instance, sites with very low traffic need setting

with fewer samples and longer supervision time.

Note:  It is highly recommended to use RX Path Imbalance Supervision

when the features Voice Services over Adaptive Multiuser Channels

on One Slot (VAMOS) and Interference Rejection Combining (IRC) are

active, because these features are dependent on RX Diversity.

If the Transceiver (TRX) is configured for 2-Way RX Diversity,

the function supervises the average imbalance between antenna A and

B over the sliding window time. When 4-Way RX Diversity is used, the

function supervises the average imbalance between antenna A and B,

and between antenna C and D, over the sliding window time. It is also

capable of detecting minor faults in one of the radio receiver paths

or degradations in the receiver antenna system.

The signal strength of the two RX branches is measured and compared

within the time window after the signals passed through the radio

receiver equipment. The results of the measurement are represented

by the following attributes for MO class Trx:

- rxImbAvgDeltaMeas1TOOLTIPFLAG, the measured average imbalance between RX branches with index 0 and 1 in rfBranchRxTOOLTIPFLAG attribute, used for the antenna pair with antenna A and B.
- rxImbAvgDeltaMeas2TOOLTIPFLAG, the measured average imbalance between RX branches with index 2 and 3 inrfBranchRxTOOLTIPFLAG attribute, used for the second antenna pair C and D with 4-Way RX Diversity.
- rxImbSupTimeElapsedTOOLTIPFLAG, the time elapsed of the supervision window time.
- rxImbNoOfSamples1TOOLTIPFLAG, the number of samples therxImbAvgDeltaMeas1TOOLTIPFLAG is based on, used for the antenna pair with antenna A and B.
- rxImbNoOfSamples2TOOLTIPFLAG, the number of samples therxImbAvgDeltaMeas2TOOLTIPFLAG is based on, used for the second antenna pair C and D with 4-Way RX Diversity.

When the average and the standard deviation of the signal strength

imbalance between RX diversity paths match the fault criteria for

a supervision period, the RX Branch Imbalance Fault alarm is reported.

For information about RX Branch Imbalance Fault handling, see RX Branch Imbalance Fault.

When the standard deviation of the signal strength imbalance between

RX diversity paths exceeds the imbalance threshold for a supervision

period, the Feeder Cable Incorrectly Connected alarm is reported.

For information about Swapped Feeder fault handling, see Feeder Cable Incorrectly Connected.

For the alarm priority from GRAT, the relationship of RX Diversity

Lost, RX Branch Imbalance Fault and Feeder Cable Incorrectly Connected

is the following:

- The alarm RX Diversity Lost has higher priority weight than the alarm RX Branch Imbalance Fault.
- The alarm RX Branch Imbalance Fault has higher priority weight than the alarm Feeder Cable Incorrectly Connected.

## 1.16 One-way RX,
No Diversity

One-way RX is typically used in small cells when RX diversity is

not needed due to coverage reasons. One-way RX can be used for indoor,

highway and tunnel configurations.

2TX/2RX radios can be used to cover two cells. Then each cell has

one antenna with 1TX/1RX, and the antennas are often pointing in opposite

directions.

The following limitations are introduced by One-way RX:

- RX Supervision is deactivated.
- Certain features cannot be used together with One-way RX, such as Voice Services over Adaptive Multiuser Channels on One Slot (VAMOS) and Interference Rejection Combining (IRC). For more information about VAMOS and IRC, see GSM RAN CPI.
- Combined Cell with multiple antenna sites is not supported with one-way RX.

## 1.17 Radio Transmission

The Radio Transmission function generates a Radio Frequency (RF)

signal from the bitz stream which constitutes a burst. The Radio Transmission

function is initiated when the ATSR is put into operation.

The transmitter is capable of frequency hopping.

The output power of RF transmitters is dynamically controlled in

bursts belonging to active channels in compliance with 3GPP standard

documentation, reference 3GPP 45.005 (GSM 900, GSM 1800) and PCS:5

(GSM 1900).

The definition of nominal power for the Baseband Radio Node is

the maximum output power the transmitter is allowed to use, measured

at the input of the transmitter reference point. The transmitter reference

point is defined as the point where the transmitter antenna is connected.

The maximum output power is set with the Baseband MOM. When the maximum

output power is set in Baseband Radio Node and unlocked, the Baseband

Radio Node sends status update on Abis SCF to BSC with a TX power

capability.

Note:  The MO Trx power in the Baseband MOM

must match the cell power in the BSC, according to  TX Power Configuration.

## 1.18 GSM MCPA
Intelligent Power Management

A GSM Baseband Radio Node needs the GSM Multicarrier Power Amplifier

(MCPA) intelligent Radio Frequency (RF) power management function

to handle multiple TRX on one MCPA and to allow the overbooking of

RF power. The function prevents the clipping and overload of the MCPA

at high traffic load by applying power back-off for low-priority traffic

channels.

See also GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management, MCPA Guideline, and GSM RAN CPI User Description, Combined Cell  for more information.

## 1.19 RF Power Management Statistics

The Baseband Radio Node calculates and aggregates statistics for

all TX in an multicarrier power amplifier where, for each TRXC, the

related TX has been enabled. These statistics can be retrieved as

performance management counters from the Baseband Radio Node.

RF Power Management (RFPM) statistics reporting starts when TRXCs

is mapped to a specific RF branch where at least one transceiver is

enabled.

RFPM statistics reporting stops counting when the BSC disables

the last related transceiver for the RF branch.

See also GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management.

## 1.20 Combined Cell

The Combined Cell feature contains two different features:

- Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites
- Combined Cell, TX Delay Diversity

### 1.20.1 Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites

A combined cell consists of a main antenna site and one or several

extension antenna sites covering the same or different geographical

areas, which together make up one cell. The extension antenna site

with its extension TRX provides spot coverage where the main antenna

site has poor coverage. This enables easy coverage extension without

the added complexity of defining new cells. Each extension TRX transmits

the same information as the parent TRX and does also have receiver

diversity to improve the reception together with the parent TRX. The

total traffic capacity of a combined cell is the same as the number

of TRX on the main antenna site. This means that extension TRX is

only used to provide additional coverage and no extra traffic capacity.

Parent Trx MO instance is created for

the main antenna site, and ExtTrx MO instances

are created for the extension antenna sites. There must be the same

number of ExtTrx MO on each extension antenna

site as there are Trx MO instances on the

main antenna sites.

The parent TRX and extension TRX can support the following antennas:

- 1 TX antenna and 1 RX antenna
- 1 TX antenna and 2 RX antennas
- 2 TX antennas and 1 RX antenna
- 2 TX antennas and 2 RX antennas

Radio Cascading is supported together with the feature Combined

Cell.There can be up to six radio units in a cascade chain and it

is recommended that the radio units used by the same GSM sector are

cascaded.

For more Combined Cell information, see GSM RAN CPI User Description, Combined Cell.

For additional Combined Cell chapters are as follows:

- GSM Managed Object Models for Combined Cell
- Introduction to Extension TRX
- TRX and Extension TRX Availability State Relation to TRXC Operational Condition for Combined Cell
- Automatic Recovery of an Abis MO, Combined Cell
- Add TRX for Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites
- Modify TRX for Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites
- Delete TRX for Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites
- Add Extension TRX
- Modify Extension TRX
- Delete Extension TRX
- Unlock TRX with Extension TRX
- Lock TRX with Extension TRX
- Connect Extension TRX to Antennas

Limitations

- The feature 4-Way RX Diversity is not supported for any TRX that is a part of one combined cell with multiple antenna sites.
- The feature 4-Way RX Diversity is not supported for any TRX from non-combined cells in the same Baseband Radio Node with Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites.

### 1.20.2 Combined Cell, TX Delay Diversity

TX Delay Diversity is a part of the Combined Cell feature and can

be used to boost the downlink output power by using two MCPAs to create

a virtual carrier with higher downlink power. This is achieved by

sending identical bursts on the same frequency with equal amplitude

on separate transmit antennas. The burst transmitted on one of the

antennas are delayed by a number of air interface symbol periods relative

to the burst sent on the other antenna. TX Delay Diversity is similar

to Software Power Boost for SCPA radio like the RUG. The BSC is not

aware of TX Delay Diversity for Baseband Nodes, it only needs to set

the appropriate TX Power value in the cell.

TX Delay Diversity is accomplished by using a radio with more than

one MCPAs, such as RRUS 12, and define a Trx MO with two TX branches to

use two MCPAs of the multiple TX radios by setting the noOfTxAntennas = 2. The characteristics of the TX Delay

Diversity feature as such will assure that both TXs send with the

same frequency. The Power will be distributed equally over the two

TX antennas, half of the power on one antenna and the other half of

the power on the other antenna.

Cross-polarized antennas can affect how TX Delay Diversity is received

by the UE or MS. For more information see  Connect TRX to Antennas.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 10   TX Delay Diversity

Note:  When 4-Way RX Diversity is used together with TX Delay Diversity,

maximum 42 TRXs can be used in the Baseband Radio Node.

The feature GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management Baseband can

be used together with TX Delay Diversity by configuring the reservedMaxTxPower to a value equal or lower than attribute configuredMaxTxPower.

Note:

If there are more than one radios in the sectorEquipmentFunction, Deterministic Carrier Allocation must be used to ensure that the

two TX branches belong to the same radio by configuring the attributes rfBranchTxRef.

If radio supporting Virtual IBW is used, both RF ports must support

the Frequency Range specified in the MO Trx, see  Instantaneous Bandwidth and

Virtual Instantaneous Bandwidth.

Applicable MOM attributes:

- noOfTxAntennas Number of TX antennas used by the TRX.
- sectorEquipmentFunctionRef Reference to MO SectorEquipmentFunction instance, LDN. MO represents radio and antenna resources used by the TRX.
- configuredMaxTxPower Configured absolute power for TRX (equally distributed over noOfTxAntennas).
- reservedMaxTxPower Power reserved in MCPA for this TRX (equally distributed over noOfTxAntennas).
- maxTxPowerCapability Power allocated for TRX, sum for noOfTxAntennas.
- bscMaxTxPower Amount of power requested for TRX (equally distributed over noOfTxAntennas) from the BSC.
- rfBranchTxRef List of references to MO RfBranch instances, LDNs. MO instances represent the RF branches (MCPA) TRX uses for TX. Used to group TRXs to a MCPA. If no reference is specified carrier allocation based on the RF branch MOM list, this is default behavior.
- rfBranchTx References to MO RfBranch(es) instances, LDN. MO represents RF branch (MCPA) TRX uses for TX. Identifies the RF branches (MCPA) for which PM counters are valid.

## 1.21 Frequency Hopping

Frequency Hopping enables the use of Time-Division Multiple Access

(TDMA) frames to change the radio frequency channel of a Basic Physical

Channel (BPC).

The BPC must be configured for frequency hopping by the BSC OML.

All frequency hopping parameters are defined for each BPC at configuration

and cannot be changed at channel activation.

Frequency hopping improves over-the-air transmission quality.

In compliance with associated documents of the 3rd Generation Partnership

Project (3GPP) standard documentation, reference 3GPP:45.003, the

frequency hopping function supports the following channel combinations:

- Full-Rate Traffic Channel (TCH/F) + Associated Control Channel (ACCH)
- Half-Rate Traffic Channel (TCH/H) + ACCH
- Packet Data Channel (PDCH)
- Stand-Alone Dedicated Control Channel (SDCCH)/8 + ACCH

Frequency hopping increases channel coding efficiency and interleaving

in the following situations:

- Multipath (or Rayleigh) fading - often depends on frequency; changing frequencies reduces this problem in the case of dips.
- Interference problems - frequency hopping shortens the long periods of high interference that can affect connections, but it does not reduce the overall system interference level, which instead is averaged out.

Frequency hopping is provided on a slot-by-slot basis in accordance

with 3GPP:45.002.

The information element channel identification (3GPP:48.058) is

ignored. BPCs carrying Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) and Common

Control Channel (CCCH) do not support frequency hopping.

Other BPCs on the BCCH frequency can use frequency hopping.

In compliance with associated documents of the 3GPP standard documentation,

reference 3GPP:48.058, the BSC initiates the function by sending a Channel\_Activation message.

Frequency hopping supports:

- Baseband hopping - each burst of the physical channel data is sent from different TRXC with different frequencies.
- Synthesizer hopping - physical channel data is always sent from the same TRXC but with a new frequency for each burst. Default in BSC.

Hopping sequences use a maximum of 32 frequencies.

## 1.22 Supervision of VSWR in MCPA used
for GSM in Single Standard Mode

VSWR supervision is configured per RfPort MO. In GSM single standard mode, both BCCH TRX and TCH TRX are supervised.

However, VSWR supervision for MCPA in Mixed Mode Radio is handled

on WCDMA or LTE carriers. For more information of hardware equipment

configuration, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

## 1.23 Micro Sleep TX
GSM

Micro Sleep TX GSM can be used to decrease energy consumption by

switching off the PA biasing when there is no data to transmit by

any carrier using the same RF port.  Switching off the PA biasing

for the idle time periods is done by Symbol Based Power Saving (SBPS)

function in radio.  Figure 11 illustrates the

Micro Sleep TX GSM.

Two new counters pmMicroTxSleepGsmMeasPeriod and pmMicroTxSleepGsmTime are introduced.

These counters indicate the total amount of time that power savings

can be achieved with the feature activated. This feature is limited,

as the counters do not measure how much power has actually been saved.

If the configuration is not supported, the counters are stepped but

energy consumption is not reduced.

Figure 11   Micro Sleep TX GSM

Micro sleep TX GSM can be active together with MCPA Power savings.

Micro Sleep TX GSM is performed when TX state is enabled while MCPA

Power Savings is performed when TX state is disabled.  Figure 12 illustrates the Combined Power Savings

scenario. For information about MCPA Power savings, see GSM RAN CPI User Description, Reduced Power Consumption in GSM RAN.

Figure 12   Combination of Micro Sleep and MCPA Power savings without

BCCH

BCCH TRX prevents Micro Sleep TX GSM for all TRX using the same

MCPA. So Micro Sleep TX GSM will not be active in cells with only

one MCPA.

Figure 13   Combination of Micro Sleep and MCPA Power savings with BCCH

Two attributes MicroSleepTxRadioCapability and MicroSleepTxRadioStatus that indicate the capability and status in radio to support

the Micro Sleep TX GSM functionality can be read on MO RfPort. Attribute MicroSleepTxRadioCapability indicates if the radio is capable of the Micro Sleep TX

GSM functionality while attribute MicroSleepTxRadioStatus indicates if the current Micro Sleep TX GSM status in the

radio is set to enabled or disabled. For more information see class RfPort.

For example:

- In mixed mode with LTE configuration, the counters are stepped when the TXs are capable of Micro Sleep TX GSM and there is no GSM data transmitting on a certain MCPA, the attribute MicroSleepTxRadioStatus on MO RfPortTOOLTIPFLAG is enabled and the energy consumption is reduced.
- In mixed mode with WCDMA configuration, the counters are stepped when the TXs are capable of Micro Sleep TX GSM and there is no GSM data transmitting on a certain MCPA, the attribute MicroSleepTxRadioStatus on MO RfPortTOOLTIPFLAG is disabled and the energy consumption is not reduced, which means Micro Sleep TX GSM is not actually performed in mixed mode with WCDMA.

Hardware Support

The feature is activated automatically per capable TRX and is applicable

to Baseband Radio Node. For more information regarding dependency

to HW, see GSM RAN CPI Micro Sleep Tx.

Counters

Micro Sleep TX GSM function introduces the following counters:

| pmMicroTxSleepGsmMeasPeriod   | Micro Sleep TX GSM measurement period accumulated time in seconds for all TX bursts in the GsmSector.                   |    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|
|                               |                                                                                                                         |    |
| pmMicroTxSleepGsmTime         | Micro Sleep TX GSM time accumulated time in seconds when no power in a TX burst is indicated to the MCPAs in the radios |    |
|                               |                                                                                                                         |    |

The following counters monitor the total time and ratio TX branches

are switched off in radio units capable of reporting it:

- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffTime
- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffRatio
- RfPort.pmTxOffTime
- RfPort.pmTxOffRatio
- FreqBandData.pmTxOffTime
- FreqBandData.pmTxOffRatio
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime1
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime2
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime3
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime4
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio1
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio2
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio3
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio4

Note:

- For the feature Combined Cell, TX Delay Diversity, double TX bursts are counted twice.
- For the feature Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites, all TX bursts of the parent TRX and its extension TRXs in a GSM sector are counted.
- In MSMM configuration the calculation is imprecise because GRAT accumulates counters without being aware of if other standard is using the MCPA or not in the radio.

Initiation

The function is automatically initiated when BSC enables TX.

Termination

The function for a TX is terminated when resetting the TX which

is running Micro Sleep TX GSM.

## 1.24 Instantaneous
Bandwidth and Virtual Instantaneous Bandwidth

The Virtual Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW) function for GSM is used

to improve the flexibility of IBW configuration by configuring GSM

on an extended IBW range in the radio.

### 1.24.1 Instantaneous Bandwidth

With IBW capability, the IBW on each radio RF port is same with

the IBW on the radio and GSM on all RF ports can only be configured

within this IBW range, which has the advantage that all Trxs can use

the same frequencies regardless which RF port that is used. See  Figure 14.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 14   IBW Capability

Take RRUS 12 Band 2 (1900) as an example, the GSM IBW on each RF

port is 40 MHz, and GSM IBW on the radio is 40 MHz.

Note:  GSM IBW on each RF port maybe has limitation due to the HW

in certain circumstances, please refer to Radio Node

Configurations in hardware CPI library for more details.

### 1.24.2 Virtual Instantaneous Bandwidth

With Virtual IBW function, GSM can be configured within a wider

IBW range, see  Figure 15.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 15   Virtual IBW Function

Take Radio 2219 Band 3 (1800) as an example, the GSM IBW on each

RF port is 40 MHz, and GSM Virtual IBW on the radio is 75 MHz.

Note:  GSM IBW on each RF port maybe has limitation due to the HW

in certain circumstances, please refer to Radio Node

Configurations in hardware CPI library for more details.

For GSM, Virtual IBW is applicable for DL TX only, because UL RX

supports full IBW for all carrier types and combinations.

The operator needs to plan Power and Frequency per Trx as well

as how to map the Trx instances to the RF ports used for TX. This

plan becomes more important with radios supporting Virtual IBW function

because different RF ports can be used for different frequency ranges.

The power used can affect the IBW of the radio. With lower power

values, higher IBW can be supported. For more information, please

refer to Radio Node Configurations in hardware

CPI library.

The Frequency Range for a Trx is configured using the arfcnMin and arfcnMax attributes;

and Deterministic Carrier Allocation can be used to tie a TRX to a

specific RF port, see Section  2.13.1.2 and Section  2.13.5.

Note:  For more information on Deterministic Carrier Allocation,

please refer to Radio Node Configurations in

hardware CPI library.

The way to handle different frequency ranges for the different

RF ports is to configure channel groups in the BSC for the corresponding

TRX instances, typically one channel group for all TRX instances using

the same RF port. The frequencies configured in the channel group

in the BSC and the Frequency Range configured for the Trx Instances

must fit the GSM IBW of the RF port in the radio. BCCH TRX is usually

a separate channel group, the RF port serving the BCCH TRX can therefore

have more than one channel groups in the BSC.

One channel group can be used for TRX instances using different

RF ports as long as the frequency range of all TRX instances fit within

the GSM IBW ranges of all the RF ports, see  Figure 16 and  Figure 17.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 16   Channel groups mapped to two RF ports

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 17   One channel group mapped to more than one RF ports

If radio HW is configured with Digital Cross Connect, Frequency

Range has limitations for RX as well as the above mentioned limitations

for TX.  If two radios are used for Digital Cross Connect, all TRX

connected to the two radios must be configured with frequency range

that fit the Virtual IBW for both radios. Because both radios are

used for demodulating RX signals for a TRX. However, the different

TRX can have different frequency ranges as long as they fit within

the Virtual IBW of both radios, see Section  2.13.2.2 for more information

on Digital Cross Connect.

The operator needs to consider the situation of Mixed Mode Radio

and multistandard configuration with GSM, because GSM can cause frequency

limitations on WCDMA and LTE.

Note:  Mixed mode Radio can further limit the IBW for certain HW

types, for more information, please refer to Radio

Node Configurations in hardware CPI library.

If the feature Combined Cell, TX Delay Diversity is used, both

RF ports must support the frequency range in the Trx, see  Combined

Cell, TX Delay Diversity for more information .

## 1.25 MCPA Power Savings

MCPA Power Savings reduces energy consumption by adjusting the

PA bias for MCPAs during periods of low traffic or turning off it

during periods of no traffic. MCPA Power savings is handled by BSC

by disabling the TX on one or more TRX when the traffic in the cell

is low. For more information, see GSM RAN CPI User

Description, Reduced Power Consumption in GSM RAN.

MCPA Power Savings can be used together with Micro Sleep TX GSM.

For more information, see Section  1.23.

## 1.26 Baseband Power Savings

The Baseband power savings function introduces a new power saving

mechanism by turning off baseband resource in GSM single mode.

When the attribute bbPowerSavingEnabled of MO PowerSaving is TRUE and bbPowerSavingStatus is activated, the GSM runs in baseband power savings mode

and powers on half of the baseband resource.

In Baseband power savings mode, the GSM supports the maximum number

of 24 TRXs in normal cell configuration, or in total 80 TRXs and extension

TRXs in combined cell configuration. If more TRXs or extension TRXs

are added and unlocked, and the baseband resource becomes insufficient,

alarms as bellow are raised respectively:

- If more TRXs or extension TRXs are added and unlocked than the maximum number of the baseband power savings mode can support, the alarm Power Saving Mode Capacity Limit Exceeded is raised.
- If the added and unlocked TRXs or extension TRXs are within the maximum number of the baseband power savings mode can support, but cannot be put into one TRX group, the alarm Resource Allocation Failure is raised.

## 1.27 IPv6 for GSM Baseband Radio Node

The IPv6 feature enables the operator to deploy GSM baseband radio

nodes in an IPv6 network, and to directly communicate with external

IPv6 networks without using additional address translation or tunneling

mechanisms.

This feature can be used for new IPv6 node deployment, as well

as for upgrading nodes that need to migrate from an IPv4 to an IPv6

RAN.

IPv6 is supported for GSM Baseband Radio Node in below interface:

- Abis

- Mu

For more information, see Manage GSM Abis Transport and Manage Transport Network.

# 2 Procedures

This section describes adding and deleting procedures of MO GsmSector, and adding, modifying, and deleting procedures

of MO Trx and MO ExtTrx . Also, this section describes unlocking and locking MO Trx. Configuration instructions of MO AbisIp are described in Manage GSM Abis Transport and configuration instruction of MO AddressIPv4  or MO AddressIPv6 are described in Manage Transport Network.

Before configuring a Baseband Radio Node, the combined cell and/or

the non-combined cell configurations can be generated by a configuration

file in ECT. The configuration file includes the specific parameter

configurations and the corresponding values of MOs' parameters. For

more information about creating configuration file by ECT, see Manage Configuration Files and Manage Equipment Configuration

Tool.

## 2.1 Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites to adding GsmSector and Trx MO instances:

- The BTS Function MO (BtsFunctionTOOLTIPFLAG) is created.
- One or more instances of MO SectorEquipmentFunctionTOOLTIPFLAG are created.

## 2.2 Configure SectorEquipmentFunction Attributes

Configure the following MO SectorEquipmentFunction attributes:

- administrativeState The administrative state of the sector.
- rfBranchRef Reference to the RfBranch MO instances being reserved.
- SectorEquipmentFunctionId The ID of the sector containing the value component of the RDN. It must be unique in the network.
- userLabel Label for free text.

Note:  When attributes are configured, the sector must be manually

locked and unlocked for the new value to take effect.

## 2.3 Add GSM
Sector

To add an MO GsmSector , do the following:

Steps

1. Create an instance of the GsmSector MO with the following attributes:
    - gsmSectorId This attribute is sent to the BSC for Sector TG to GsmSector correlation purposes. Note: The gsmSectorId supports up to 64 characters.
    - userLabel Label for free text.

## 2.4 Delete GSM Sector

To delete a GsmSector MO, do the following:

Steps

1. Delete the instance of the GsmSector MO.Note: All child MO instances of the GsmSector MO must be in the administrativeState=LOCKED. Otherwise the instance cannot be deleted.

## 2.5 Add TRX

In order to create an instance of MO Trx, all MO instances that will

be referenced by MO Trx must have been

created in advance:

- GsmSector, see Add GSM Sector.
- SectorEquipmentFunction, see Configure SectorEquipmentFunction Attributes.
- RfBranch, see Connect TRX to Antennas.
- CcBranch, see Connect TRX to Antennas.

To add a Trx, do the following:

Steps

1. Create an instance of the MO TrxTOOLTIPFLAG with the following attributes:
    - arfcnMax
    - arfcnMin
    - frequencyBand
    - sectorEquipmentFunctionRef
    - trxId The recommended values are 0-11, 12-126 are reserved for future use.
    - noOfRxAntennasNote: When 4-Way RX Diversity is used together with TX Delay Diversity, maximum 42 TRXs can be used in the Baseband Radio Node.
    - noOfTxAntennasNote: For TX Delay Diversity the setting must be noOfTxAntennas = 2.
    - configuredMaxTxPower Specifies the requested absolute power for the TRX. The configuredMaxTxPower value must match the BSC cell power. For conversion table, see TX Power Configuration. In radio units shared by multiple radio access technologies competing for the same radio resources, the available output power is allocated to each TRX or extension TRX or sector carrier in a first come first served principle until all available output power is used.
    - reservedMaxTxPower Specifies the power reserved in the MCPA for this TRX. If GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management is not used, set this to same value as configuredMaxTxPower. For information about Intelligent Power Management and Overbooking, see GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management.
    - combinedCellType Used for configuring Combined Cell Type for TRX. When Combined Cell is not applied, combinedCellType is configured to NON\_COMBINED\_CELL by default. Note: All TRXs in a GSM Sector are recommended to have the same combinedCellType.
2. Add TRX all known and planned Trx instances before the first Trx is unlocked.

When a TRX is added, three attributes of the MO Trx have the following values:

- administrativeState = LOCKED
- operationalState = DISABLED
- availabilityStatus = OFF\_LINE

### 2.5.1 Add TRX
for Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites

Adding TRX for Combined Cell with multiple antenna sites is similar

to add TRX without Combined Cell, see  Add

TRX for more information.

In the feature Combined Cell, Trx.combinedCellType must be configured

to define combined cell type on parent TRX. The extension antenna

sites with the extension TRXs are used to provide good coverage.

All TRXs in a GSM Sector must have the same Trx.combinedCellType.

When Trx.combinedCellType is configured

to a type different from NON\_COMBINED\_CELL, BSC is informed with the capability visible with RXCAP.

Mix of Combined Cell and Non-combined cell in the same GSM Sector

is not recommended, instead the GSM Sector can be split into two GSM

Sectors with different combined cell types.

|   Value | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1 | COMBINED_CELL_TYPE1 | The combined cell with a main antenna site acting as the dominant radio transmitter and defining the outer cell coverage border. The radio propagation distance between the extension antenna sites and the main antenna site is shorter than 2 km.                                                                                                            |
|       2 | COMBINED_CELL_TYPE2 | The combined cell with a main antenna site acting as the dominant radio transmitter and defining the outer cell coverage border. The radio propagation distance between at least one extension antenna site and the main antenna site is longer than approximately 2 km.                                                                                       |
|       3 | COMBINED_CELL_TYPE3 | The combined cell without a dominant main antenna site. The outer coverage border of the combined cell is defined by the aggregated coverage area provided by the main and the extension antenna sites. The distance between antenna sites is relatively short,  ranging from a few meters up to approximately 2 km.                                           |
|       4 | COMBINED_CELL_TYPE4 | The combined cell without a dominant main antenna site and used for high speed train or highway scenarios. The outer coverage border of the combined cell is instead defined by the aggregated coverage area provided by main and extension antenna sites. The maximum radio propagation distance between neighboring antenna sites is in the order of 1-2 km. |

The parent Trx MO has some attributes which

are inherited by the child ExtTrx MO: Trx.frequencyBand, Trx.noOfRxAntennas , Trx.noOfTxAntennas, Trx.arfcnMin and Trx.arfcnMax. In particular, Trx.noOfRxAntennas must be 1 or

2 and Trx.noOfTxAntennas must be 1or

2.

### 2.5.2 TX
Power Configuration

It is important to set the power levels properly in the Baseband

Radio Node and in the BSC. The power attribute for MO Trx can be set to be a higher value compared what the

BSC initially uses but not higher than the hardware capability and

also if there are enough with HWACs.

Note:  For TX Delay Diversity, the TX branches must be used in the

same radio unit. The Power is distributed equally over the two TX

antennas, half of the power on one antenna and the other half of the

power on the other antenna. See more information in  Combined Cell, TX Delay

Diversity.

Remember the following:

- The Baseband Node uses mW for configuring in the Baseband MOM.
- The BSC uses the TX power directly if the BSC supports decimal power configuration.
- The BSC uses a rounded TX power value (dBm) up to the nearest integer if the BSC does not support decimal power configuration. For the power conversion between the BSC power and the TX power, see Table 8.
- The MOM shows read-only attributes values related to BSC dBm with one decimal.

Note:  When calculating and adding the powers for several TRXs together

and then converting between dBm and mW, the dBm with one decimal value

must be used, column 1 in the table.

(1)   The BSC uses a rounded TX power value

(dBm) up to the nearest integer.

(2)   Shows the configuration

attributes values in the MOM.

(3)  Shows read-only attributes

values related to BSC power values x 10.

For example: The BSC Cell Power Values is 42 dBm. The value 42

represents the value 15000 (mW) in column 3 and the value 420 in column

4 in the table.

## 2.6 Modify TRX

1. Block the TRXC(s) in BSC corresponding to the TRX to be modified. Do as follows:
    1. Block the TRXC(s) in BSC using command RXBLI without FORCE parameter in order to prevent new calls on the TRXCs.
    2. Block the TRXC(s) in BSC using command RXBLI with FORCE parameter to move remaining traffic. Wait 5 seconds.
2. Change administrativeState of MO Trx to LOCKED. Wait until the TRXC(s) are automatically deleted in BSC, it may take up to 45 seconds.
3. If required, modify the following attributes of MO Trx:
    - sectorEquipmentFunctionRef
    - frequencyBand
    - arfcnMin
    - arfcnMax
    - noOfRxAntennasNote: When 4-Way RX Diversity is used together with TX Delay Diversity, maximum 42 TRX can be used in the Baseband Radio Node.
    - noOfTxAntennasNote: For TX Delay Diversity the setting must be noOfTxAntennas = 2.
    - configuredMaxTxPower Specifies the requested absolute power for the TRX. The configuredMaxTxPower value must match the BSC cell power. For conversion table, see TX Power Configuration. In radio units shared by multiple radio access technologies competing for the same radio resources, the available output power is allocated to each TRX or extension TRX or sector carrier in a first come first served principle until all available output power is used.
    - reservedMaxTxPower Specifies the power reserved in the MCPA for this TRX. If GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management is not used, set this to same value as configuredMaxTxPower. For information about Intelligent Power Management and Overbooking, see GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management.
    - combinedCellType Used for configuring Combined Cell Type for TRX. When Combined Cell is not applied, combinedCellType is configured to NON\_COMBINED\_CELL by default. When Combined Cell is supported, combinedCellType can be configured to one of four Combined Cell types: COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE1, COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE2, COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE3 or COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE4. The extension antenna sites with the extension TRXs are used to improve coverage in one cell where the main antenna site has poor coverage. All TRXs in a GSM Sector must have the same combinedCellType. When combinedCellType is configured to a type different from NON\_COMBINED\_CELL, BSC is informed with the capability visible with RXCAP. Mix of Combined Cell and Non-combined cell in the same GSM Sector is not recommended, instead the GSM Sector can be split into two GSM Sectors with different combined cell types. Value Type Description 0 NON\_COMBINED\_CELL Used when combined cell is not applied. 1 COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE1 The combined cell with a main antenna site acting as the dominant radio transmitter and defining the outer cell coverage border. The radio propagation distance between the extension antenna sites and the main antenna site is shorter than 2 km. 2 COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE2 The combined cell with a main antenna site acting as the dominant radio transmitter and defining the outer cell coverage border. The radio propagation distance between at least one extension antenna site and the main antenna site is longer than approximately 2 km. 3 COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE3 The combined cell without a dominant main antenna site. The outer coverage border of the combined cell is defined by the aggregated coverage area provided by the main and the extension antenna sites. The distance between antenna sites is relatively short, ranging from a few meters up to approximately 2 km. 4 COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE4 The combined cell without a dominant main antenna site and used for high speed train or highway scenarios. The outer coverage border of the combined cell is instead defined by the aggregated coverage area provided by main and extension antenna sites. The maximum radio propagation distance between neighboring antenna sites is in the order of 1-2 km.
4. If required, connect the TRX to the antenna system by setting up references between the MO Trx and the MO RfBranch instance or instances that are used by the MO SectorEquipmentFunction. For more information, see Connect TRX to Antennas.
    - rfBranchRxRef
    - rfBranchTxRef
5. Change administrativeState of MO Trx to UNLOCKED.
6. Unblock the TRXC(s) in BSC that previously were blocked.

### 2.6.1 Modify
TRX for Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna Sites

Modifying TRX for Combined Cell with multiple antenna sites is

similar to modify TRX without Combined Cell, see  Modify TRX for more information. However,

the modification of Trx.noOfRxAntennas and Trx.noOfTxAntennas is restricted. Trx.noOfRxAntennas must be 1 or

2 and Trx.noOfTxAntennas must be 1 for

the feature Combined Cell. If a modified attribute on MO Trx instance is inherited by MO ExtTrx instance, the modification is used on the MO Trx instance and MO ExtTrx instances when

MO Trx is unlocked at the next time. For

more inherited attribute information, see  Introduction to Extension TRX.

## 2.7 Delete TRX

When a TRX is deleted, the Trx MO instance

and related parameters are deleted from the Baseband Radio Node.

Note:  If the Trx MO administrative state

is UNLOCKED it cannot be deleted.

To delete a TRX, do the following:

Steps

1. Lock the TRX by setting the administrative state of the Trx MO instance to LOCKED.
2. Delete the Trx MO instance.

### 2.7.1 Delete TRX for Combined Cell with Multiple Antenna
Sites

Deleting TRX for Combined Cell with multiple antenna sites is similar

to delete TRX without Combined Cell, see  Delete TRX for more information.

Note:  All child MO ExtTrx instances

on parent TRX instance are deleted.

## 2.8 Add
Extension TRX

In order to create an instance of MO ExtTrx, the parent Trx MO must be created and all MO instances that will

be referenced by MO ExtTrx must have been

created in advance:

- Radio unit exist in the Equipment part of the MOM

Note:  Radio Cascading is supported together with the feature Combined

Cell. There can be up to six radio units in a cascade chain and it

is recommended that the radio units used by the same GSM sector are

cascaded. For more Combined Cell information, see GSM RAN CPI User Description, Combined Cell.

- Trx, see Add TRX for Combined Cell with Extension Site.
- SectorEquipmentFunction, see Configure SectorEquipmentFunction Attributes.
- RfBranch, see Connect TRX to Antennas.
- CcBranch, see Connect TRX to Antennas.

Before an extension TRX is added, four attributes of the MO Trx must have the following values:

- administrativeState = LOCKED
- combinedCellType = COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE1, COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE2, COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE3 or COMBINED\_CELL\_TYPE4
- noOfRxAntennas = 1 or 2
- noOfTxAntennas = 1 or 2

Steps

1. Create an instance of the MO ExtTrxTOOLTIPFLAG with the following attributes:
    - antSiteIndex
    - extTrxId
    - sectorEquipmentFunctionRef
    - extTrxDistance
    - extTrxRadius
    - configuredMaxTxPower Specifies the requested absolute power for the extension TRX. The configuredMaxTxPower is configured to the nominal power value for the extension antenna site, see GSM RAN CPI User Description, Combined Cell for more details. For conversion table, see TX Power Configuration. In radio units shared by multiple radio access technologies competing for the same radio resources, the available output power is allocated to each TRX or extension TRX or sector carrier in a first come first served principle until all available output power is used.
    - reservedMaxTxPower Specifies the power reserved in the MCPA for this extension TRX. If GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management is not used, set this to the same value as configuredMaxTxPower. For information about Intelligent Power Management and Overbooking, see GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management.
2. If required, connect the extension TRX to the antenna system by setting up references between the MO ExtTrx and the MO RfBranch instance or branches that are used by the MO SectorEquipmentFunction. For more information, see Connect Extension TRX to Antennas.
    - rfBranchRxRef
    - rfBranchTxRef
3. Add extension TRX all known and planned Trx and ExtTrx instances before the first Trx is unlocked.

When an extension TRX is added, two attributes of the MO ExtTrx have the following values:

- operationalState = DISABLED
- availabilityStatus = OFF\_LINE

## 2.9 Modify Extension TRX

1. Block the TRXC in BSC corresponding to the TRX with the extension TRX to be modified. Do as follows:
    1. Block the TRXC in BSC using command RXBLI without FORCE parameter in order to prevent new calls on the TRXCs.
    2. Block the TRXC in BSC using command RXBLI with FORCE parameter to move remaining traffic. Wait 5 seconds.
2. Change administrativeState of parent MO Trx to LOCKED. Wait until the TRXC is automatically deleted in BSC, it may take up to 45 seconds.
3. If required, modify the following attributes of MO ExtTrx:
    - antSiteIndex
    - sectorEquipmentFunctionRef
    - extTrxDistance
    - extTrxRadius
    - configuredMaxTxPower Specifies the requested absolute power for the extension TRX. The configuredMaxTxPower is configured to the nominal power value for the extension antenna site, see GSM RAN CPI User Description, Combined Cell for more details. For conversion table, see TX Power Configuration. In radio units shared by multiple radio access technologies competing for the same radio resources, the available output power is allocated to each TRX or extension TRX or sector carrier in a first come first served principle until all available output power is used.
    - reservedMaxTxPower Specifies the power reserved in the MCPA for this extension TRX. If GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management is not used, set this to same value as configuredMaxTxPower. For information about Intelligent Power Management and Overbooking, see GSM MCPA Intelligent Power Management.
4. If required, connect the extension TRX to the antenna system by setting up references between the MO ExtTrx and the MO RfBranch instance or branches that are used by the MO SectorEquipmentFunction. For more information, see Connect Extension TRX to Antennas
    - rfBranchRxRef
    - rfBranchTxRef
5. Change administrativeState of parent MO Trx to UNLOCKED.
6. Unblock the TRXC(s) in BSC.

## 2.10 Delete Extension TRX

When an extension TRX is deleted, the ExtTrx MO instance and related parameters are deleted from the Baseband

Radio Node.

To delete an extension TRX,  do the following:

Steps

1. Lock the parent TRX by setting the administrativeState of parent Trx MO instance to LOCKED.
2. Delete the ExtTrx MO instance.
3. If all ExtTrx MO instances under a parent TRX are deleted in order to deactivate feature Combined Cell, the attribute combinedCellType on Trx MO must be changed to NON\_COMBINED\_CELL.

## 2.11 Unlock TRX

When all required Trx MO instances are

defined (Add Trx) and locked, the Trx MO instances are put into operation by unlocking

them. See also  Introduction to TRX.

When MO Trx is unlocked, any needed

L2TP transport sessions for the TRX (and its SAPIs) are setup and

the baseband and radio resources are allocated to the TRX shown by

attributes operationalState=ENABLED and availabilityStatus=&lt;empty&gt;.

The OML and RSL Layer2 links are established for TRX, shown by attributes abisTrxcOmlState=UP and abisTrxRslState=UP.

To unlock a TRX, do the following:

Steps

1. Set the administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED on the TrxTOOLTIPFLAG MO.

### 2.11.1 Unlock TRX with Extension TRX

When all required Trx MO instances and ExtTrx MO instances are defined and locked, the Trx MO instances and ExtTrx MO instances are put into operation by unlocking them. Unlocking

TRX with extension TRX is similar to unlock TRX, see  Unlock TRX for more information.

The ExtTrx MO does not have the attribute administrativeState, instead the parent Trx MO is unlocked.

## 2.12 Lock TRX

When a TRX is locked, resources allocated to that MO Trx instance are released by the

Baseband Radio Node.

When a MO Trx is locked, the L2TP transport

sessions for the TRX (and its SAPIs) are disconnected.

TRX are released shown by operationalState=DISABLED, availabilityStatus=OFFLINE. The

OML and RSL Layer2 links are disconnected, shown by attributes abisTrxcOmlState=DOWN and abisTrxRslState=DOWN.

When locking the TRX resources, transmission and reception of mandatory

common channels are turned off and all UE contexts residing in the

TRX are discarded.

To lock a TRX,  do the following:

Steps

1. Set the administrativeState attribute to LOCKED on MO TrxTOOLTIPFLAG.

### 2.12.1 Lock TRX Carrying Traffic

Block the TRXC in BSC corresponding to the TRX with the extension

TRX, do as follows:

1. Block the TRXC in BSC using command RXBLI without FORCE parameter in order to prevent new calls on the TRXCs.
2. Block the TRXC in BSC using command RXBLI with FORCE parameter to move remaining traffic.
3. Wait 5 seconds.
4. Change administrativeState of parent MO Trx to LOCKED.
5. Wait until the TRXC is automatically deleted in BSC, it takes up to 45 seconds approximately.

### 2.12.2 Lock TRX with Extension TRX

When a parent TRX is locked, the resources for both the parent Trx instance and child ExtTrx instances are released by the Baseband Radio Node. Locking TRX with

extension TRX is similar to lock TRX, see  Lock TRX for more information.

The ExtTrx MO does not have the attribute administrativeState, instead the parent Trx MO is locked.

## 2.13 Connect TRX to Antennas

The RF branches for RX and TX of a Trx can be configured separately.

The TRX can be configured to use RX and TX antennas in two different

ways, using Deterministic Carrier Allocation, or without it. Without

Deterministic Carrier Allocation, antennas are allocated automatically,

based on the configuration of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO. Then it is important to have an appropriate configuration of

the SectorEquipmentFunction MO, to achieve

best performance.

TX antennas must be connected to the same radio unit.

The RX RF branches can be connected to the TRX in three different

ways:

- Without Cross Connect, all antennas for one TRX are connected to the same radio unit.
- With Digital Cross Connect, the antennas for one TRX are connected to different radio units, and the RX information from the radios to the TRX is sent in digital format.
- With Analog Cross Connect, the antennas for one TRX are connected to different radio units, and the RX information from one radio to the other radio is sent in analog format.

### 2.13.1 Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Carrier
Allocation

The TRX can be configured to use RX and TX antennas in two different

ways, using Deterministic Carrier Allocation, or without it, using

only SectorEquipmentFunction configuration.

#### 2.13.1.1 Connecting TRX to Antennas Using Only
SectorEquipmentFunction Configuration

Without Deterministic Carrier Allocation, the Baseband Radio Node

allocates RX or TX antennas to the Trx automatically,

without specifying any RF branches.

For RX branches, the RX antennas are normally allocated to the Trx based on the order of RF branch references in the

MO attribute SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef and the number of RX antennas specified by Trx.noOfRxAntennas, but other allocations are also possible.

For TX branches, the TX antennas are allocated to the Trx based on the number of TX antennas specified by Trx.noOfTxAntennas.

#### 2.13.1.2 Connecting TRX
to Antennas Using Deterministic Carrier Allocation

When Deterministic Carrier Allocation is used, the Baseband Radio

Node allocates specific RX or TX antennas to the Trx.

For RX branches, the specific RX antennas are allocated to the Trx based on the configuration of the attribute Trx.rfBranchRxRef and the number of RX antennas specified

by Trx.noOfRxAntennas. This allows selecting

the exact subset of RX antennas to be used by the Trx, in case there are many RF branches in the SectorEquipmentFunction. Also, it is possible to control the configuration of RX branches

by specifying the Trx.rfBranchRxRef attributes

in a specific order. The antennas are connected to the Trx in the order that the Trx.rfBranchRxRef attributes are listed in the configuration.

For TX branches, the specific TX antennas are allocated to the Trx based on the configuration of the attribute Trx.rfBranchTxRef and the number of TX antennas specified

by Trx.noOfTxAntennas.

If radio with Virtual IBW function is used, see  Instantaneous Bandwidth and Virtual Instantaneous

Bandwidth for more information.

If GSM has more than 3 TRXs per radio which supports a maximum

of 6 GSM DL carriers or more than 4 TRXs per radio which supports

a maximum of 8 GSM DL carriers, Deterministic Carrier Aggregation

is used, see Radio Node Configurations for

more details.

### 2.13.2 Radio Configuration and RF Branch
Connection to TRX

For the same TRX, RX RF branches are normally allocated to the

same RF ports and antennas as the TX RF branches.

However, if there are more RX branches than TX branches, the additional

RX branches can be connected to a different radio unit in the SectorEquipmentFunction, using Analog or Digital Cross

Connect.

#### 2.13.2.1 Transmitter RF Branch Connection to TRX

A TX RF branch can be allocated for the TRX from any radio in the SectorEquipmentFunction.

For TX Power Overbooking, GSM Intelligent Power Management, it

is important to specify which Trx instances

use the same MCPA and TX RF port. If there are more than one MCPAs

and TX RF ports in the SectorEquipmentFunction, Deterministic Carrier Allocation must be used.

When TX Delay Diversity is used, both TX RF branches must be connected

to the same radio. Therefore, also the radio must have two or more

MCPAs and TX RF ports. If there are more than one radios in the SectorEquipmentFunction, Deterministic Carrier Allocation

must be used.

When TX Power Overbooking, GSM Intelligent Power Management, is

used together with TX Delay Diversity, both TX branches must be connected

to the same radio. If there are more than one radio in the SectorEquipmentFunction or there are more than two

TX RF branches in the radio, Deterministic Carrier Allocation must

be used.

For Mixed Mode Radio with triple RAT configuration only two RATs

can be connected to one RF-Port. To ensure that the Trx is connected to the correct RF-Port, Deterministic Carrier Allocation

must be used.

If radio with Virtual IBW function is used, see  Instantaneous Bandwidth and Virtual Instantaneous

Bandwidthfor more information.

#### 2.13.2.2 Receiver RF Branch Connection to TRX

The RX RF branches can be connected to the TRX in three different

ways:

- Without Cross Connect
- With Digital Cross Connect
- With Analog Cross Connect

No Cross Connect

Without cross connect, all antennas for one TRX are connected to

the same radio unit.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 18   2-Way RX Diversity without Cross Connect

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 19   4-Way RX Diversity without Cross Connect

Digital Cross Connect

With Digital Cross Connect, the antennas for one TRX are connected

to different radio units, and the RX information from the radios to

the TRX is sent in digital format. The function requires that the

sector is equipped with RBBs that support Digital Cross Connect for

either 2-Way or 4-Way RX Diversity.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 20   2-Way RX Diversity with Digital Cross Connect

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 21   4-Way RX Diversity with Digital Cross Connect

If two radios are used for Digital Cross Connect, all TRX connected

to the two radios must be configured with frequency range that fit

the IBW for both radios. Because both radios are used for demodulating

RX signals for a TRX. This affects both RX and TX. However, the different

TRX can have different frequency ranges as long as they fit within

the IBW of both radios.

Note:  Digital Cross Connect is supported only for uplink data.

For more information, see Radio Node Configurations in hardware CPI library.

Analog Cross Connect

With Analog Cross Connect, the antennas for one TRX are connected

to different radio units, and the RX information from one radio to

the other radio is sent in analog format. The last receiver radio

converts the RX information to digital format and sends it to the

TRX. It is used only for 2-Way RX Diversity.

With Analog Cross Connect the analog RF cables between the radios

must be modelled in MOM as CcBranch in SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef, and also CcLink needs to be defined in the Equipment MO. A Trx configured with Analog Cross

Connect typically has one RfBranch and

one CcBranch.

For a typical arrangement, see  Figure 22. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment and Radio Node Configurations.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 22   2-Way RX Diversity with Analog Cross Connect

Analog Cross Connect supports configurations when the two radios

use different IBWs.

Analog Cross Connect is not supported in LTE, so it cannot be used

in Mixed Mode Radio with LTE.

### 2.13.3 Antenna Configuration for 4-Way
Receiver Diversity

Antenna configuration for 4-Way Receiver Diversity requires extra

consideration for optimal performance, for which see  Table 11.

![Image](../images/2_1553-LZA7016005Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

For 4-Way RX Diversity it is important that each antenna pair has one -45 degree antenna and one +45 degree antenna. |

### 2.13.4 Connect TRX to RX Antenna with
Deterministic Carrier Allocation

For 2-Way and 4-way RX Diversity, antennas are connected to a receiver

in antenna pairs. If cross-polarized antennas are used, the best performance

is achieved when the antennas in each antenna pair have different

polarization. To ensure this, and to achieve optimal configuration,

it is recommended to use Deterministic Carrier Allocation for 4-Way

RX Diversity. For 2-Way RX Diversity, Deterministic Carrier Allocation

must be used if there are more antennas in the SectorEquipmentFunction MO than needed for the TRX.

The RX branches can be RfBranch or CcBranch. If CcBranch is

used, then CcLink also needs to be defined

in the Equipment MO, and CcBranch and RfBranch must be referenced from

the SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef MO attribute. CcBranch is used only with

Analog Cross Connect.

To connect TRX to RX antennas using Deterministic Carrier Allocation

do the following:

Prerequisites

References are set up between the SectorEquipmentFunction MO and the used branch or branches in the AntennaUnitGroup, see  Figure 4.

Note:  These references must match physical cabling.

Steps

1. Configure the attribute Trx.rfBranchRxRefinstances, so that they point to RfBranch and CcBranch MO instances in proper order to accomplish pairwise polarizationNote: The SectorEquipmentFunction must be LOCKED when adding RfBranch or CcBranch.

For more information of hardware equipment configuration, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

### 2.13.5 Connect
TRX to TX Antenna with Deterministic Carrier Allocation

When GSM Intelligent Power Management is used, and more than one

TX antennas are defined for the SectorEquipmentFunction MO, Deterministic Carrier Allocation for TX branches must be used.

This ensures that the Trx is connected

to the correct antenna.

For TX Delay Diversity, Deterministic Carrier Allocation for TX

branches must be used if there are more than one radios in the SectorEquipmentFunction. Then, by configuring the attribute Trx.rfBranchTxRef, it can be ensured that the two TX

branches belong to the same radio.

GSM Intelligent Power Management can be used together with TX Delay

Diversity. Then Deterministic Carrier Allocation must be used in the

following cases:

- If there are more than one radio in the SectorEquipmentFunction, to specify which radio is to be used.
- If there are more than two MCPAs in the radio, to specify which two TX antennas are to be used.

For Mixed Mode Radio with triple RAT configuration only two RATs

can be connected to one RF-Port. To ensure that the Trx is connected to the correct RF-Port, Deterministic Carrier Allocation

must be used.

If radio with Virtual IBW function is used, see  Instantaneous Bandwidth and Virtual Instantaneous

Bandwidth for more information.

To connect TRX to TX antennas using Deterministic Carrier Allocation,

do the following:

Prerequisites

References are set up between the SectorEquipmentFunction MO and the used branch or branches in the AntennaUnitGroup, see  Figure 4.

Note:  These references must match physical cabling.

Steps

1. Configure the attribute Trx.rfBranchTxRef instance or instances. The TX branches can only be RfBranch.Note: The SectorEquipmentFunction must be LOCKED when adding RfBranch. For more information of hardware equipment configuration, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

## 2.14 Connect Extension TRX to Antennas

Connecting extension TRX to antennas is similar to connect TRX

to antennas. For more information, see  Connect TRX to Antennas.

For the feature Combined Cell, the extension TRX supports 1 TX branch

and 1 RX branch/2 RX branches, or 2 TX branches and 1 RX branch/2

RX branches.

# 3 Appendix A

For more possible TRX with 1TX2RX resource allocation for Combined

Cell, see  Table 12.
