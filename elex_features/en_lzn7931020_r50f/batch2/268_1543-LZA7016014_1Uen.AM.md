# 2 Remedy Action for ExternalENodeBFunction: Elastic RAN feature is not activated in remote eNodeB.

The Inter-Node Feature

Incompatibility alarm is raised when trying to establish a

relationship with another eNodeB for the purposes of Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation or Elastic RAN, but the feature is not activated in the remote

eNodeB.

The impact of the fault is that the Elastic RAN or

Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation relationship is not enabled towards the

eNodeB.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the configuration of the Elastic RAN feature at the remote eNodeB and correct configuration errors.
3. Lock the TermPointToEnb MO corresponding to the remote eNodeB then unlock the TermPointToEnb MO. This retriggers the Elastic RAN setup.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 3 Remedy Action for ExternalENodeBFunction: Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation is not activated in remote eNodeB.

The Inter-Node Feature

Incompatibility alarm is raised when trying to establish a

relationship with another eNodeB for the purposes of Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation or Elastic RAN, but the feature is not activated in the remote

eNodeB.

The impact of the fault is that the Elastic RAN or

Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation relationship is not enabled towards the

eNodeB.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check the configuration of the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature at the remote eNodeB and correct configuration errors.
3. Lock the TermPointToEnb MO corresponding to the remote eNodeB then unlock the TermPointToEnb MO. This retriggers the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation setup.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

4. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 4 Remedy Action for ExternalENodeBFunction: both ERAN and IeNB licenses are inoperable in remote eNodeB.

The alarm Neither Inter-eNodeB

Carrier Aggregation nor Elastic RAN is activated in remote eNodeB is

raised when trying to establish a relationship with another eNodeB for the purposes of

Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation or Elastic RAN, but both the ERAN and IeNB licenses are

not activated in the remote eNodeB.

The impact of the fault is that the Elastic RAN or

Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation relationship is not enabled towards the

eNodeB.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Check and activate both ERAN and IeNB licenses on every involved eNodeB.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

3. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 5 Remedy Action for EUtranCellFDD: ESS partner not configured for ESS.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the LTE cell.
3. Lock the NR cell.
4. Ensure that the value of NRSectorCarrier.essScPairId attribute is set to more than 0, a unique, non-zero value.
5. Ensure that the value of EUtranCellRelation.essEnabled attribute is set to true on the partner ESS NR cell.
6. Unlock the partner NR cell.
7. Unlock the LTE cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Consult the next level of maintenance support.

# 6 Remedy Action for NRCellDU: ESS partner not configured for ESS.

Cell is disabled.

Steps

1. Check for correlated alarms and resolve alarms with higher severity first. For detailed instructions on identifying correlated alarms and determining the order of their resolution, see Check for Correlated Alarms.
2. Lock the LTE cell.
3. Lock the NR cell.
4. Ensure that the value of SectorCarrier.essScPairId attribute is set to more than 0, a unique, non-zero value.
5. Ensure that the value of GUtranCellRelation.essEnabled attribute is set to true on the partner ESS NR cell.
6. Unlock the partner LTE cell.
7. Unlock the NR cell.

If the alarm remains, do the following:

8. Consult the next level of maintenance support.
