Summary

Common channel beamforming is used for cell shaping. Cell shaping provides flexible cell

coverage for different environments. Capacity and data rate coverage are enhanced by

beamforming.

In the downlink, Massive MIMO supports single-user MIMO with up to four layers. Both

horizontal and vertical beamforming are supported. Codebook-based beamforming is

implemented for better coverage and higher single user peak rate.

Downlink single-user MIMO provides the following benefits:

- The antenna transmits more than one beam to a UE at the same time.
- In poor radio conditions, good coverage can be provided by using only one beam.
- High peak data rates are provided for the cell users by maximizing the use of the radio resources.
- The single-user peak rate increases proportionally with the number of layers.
- The antenna array transmitter power is split between the beams. This means that more beams equal less power for each beam.
- The power split over layers can increase the throughput.

Uplink single-user SIMO provides the following benefits:

- The advanced receiver improves coverage, and reduces the interference in diverse environments.
- Intra-cell and inter-cell interference is reduced by utilizing the large number of transceiver chains.
- Single layer is supported in the uplink.

## 2.4 Scheduling in Low-Band

For more information on scheduling in low-band, see Scheduler.

### 2.4.1 Scheduling Algorithm for Low-Band

Summary

Resource-fair scheduling is used. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates

are sent to the scheduler. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based on

downlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on the

PUCCH scheduling request, the BSR, or prescheduling.

An increased number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities requires the support of

PDCCH resources. Downlink and uplink PDCCH scheduling elements are supported in each

slot and cell. In the downlink, link adaptation allows for processing scheduling

entities in each slot and cell.

The allocation of downlink and uplink scheduling entities in each slot provides the

opportunity to decrease the RTT latency when there are more connected users. Lower

latency can provide increased TCP throughput.

NR PDCCH Link Adaptation

The functionality allocates as few CCEs as possible for DCI transmission in

user-specific control signaling. Capacity increases in terms of SE/TTI around the

cell center. Using the largest aggregation level allows for an increase in PDCCH

coverage.

### 2.4.2 Scheduling Request for Low-Band

A Scheduling Request (SR) is used by the UE for requesting PUSCH resources for a new

PUSCH transmission.

In NR, the SR is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE level as in

LTE.

The MAC entity can be configured with zero, one, or more SRs. An SR configuration

consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SRs across different BWPs and cells. For each

logical channel, one PUCCH resource is configured per BWP for SRs.

The number of PRBs used for PUCCH format 1 is dynamically increased when there are many

connected UEs and more SR resources are necessary. To achieve this, PRBs initially used

for PUSCH are temporarily converted to PUCCH. This results in better uplink resource use

and higher PUSCH throughput when the number of connected UEs is lower.

Initially, one PUCCH PRB pair is available for SRs at cell unlock. When

SR resources from this first PRB pair are exhausted, more PRB pairs are configured

dynamically for PUCCH. PRBs are taken from PUSCH for this reason. UE grouping and 5QI

configuration are not considered in SR resource allocation.

For SR resource allocation, UEs can be assigned to the following SR

periodicity

pools:

- Short
- Common
- Long

The process of assigning UEs to the SR periodicity pools is

handled with the following logic in the order of the UEs connecting to the network:

1. The first UE to connect to the network gets SR periodicity resources from the short SR periodicity pool.
2. If the short pool is exhausted, the UEs that connect afterward are assigned resources from the common SR periodicity pool.
3. If the common pool is exhausted, all further UEs that connect are assigned SR periodicity resources from the maximum SR periodicity pool.

By default, SRs have high priority. SR priority can be configured using the

QoS-controlled SR scheduling function of the QoS Framework feature.

### 2.4.3 Scheduling Channels

The feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink

channels.

|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Downlink    | PDSCH resources (PRBs and symbols)     PDCCH resources     CSI-RS(1) | Downlink scheduling resides entirely in the node.                                                                 |
| Uplink      | PUSCH resources (PRBs and symbols)     PUCCH resources               | In the uplink, both the node and the UE are involved in the                                 scheduling procedure. |

(1)

CSI-RS is used for the TRS only

### 2.4.4 Scheduling Priority in Low-Band

The feature determines which UEs are assigned resources in each slot of each

cell.

Scheduling is based on the scheduling weight attached to

data in

buffer.

The user with the longer scheduling delay is to be scheduled earlier.

HARQ

In NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the

uplink:

| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.     The number of HARQ processes is explicitly indicated in                                         DCI.   |
|----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Adaptive       |    | HARQ retransmission requires an uplink grant or a downlink                             assignment.                                                          |

HARQ ACK is sent on PUCCH and multiplexed on PUSCH, with or without uplink SCH.

### 2.4.5 Data Transmission

Scheduler Low-Band only supports FDD. Downlink and uplink are configured at a different

spectrum at the same frequency band and available for every slot.

Summary

Common channel beamforming is used for cell shaping. Cell shaping

provides flexible cell coverage for different environments. Capacity and data rate

coverage are enhanced by beamforming.

In the downlink, Massive MIMO supports single-user MIMO with up to four

layers. Both horizontal and vertical beamforming are supported. Codebook-based

beamforming is implemented for better coverage and higher single user peak rate.

Downlink Single-User MIMO

Downlink single-user MIMO is implemented in NR as part of the Massive

MIMO feature. With downlink single-user MIMO, the antenna transmits more than one

beam to a UE at the same time.

In poor radio conditions, good coverage can be provided by using only

one beam. Downlink single-user MIMO provides higher peak rates for users with good

radio conditions.

The single-user peak rate increases proportionally with the number of layers. With

four layers, the peak rate reaches close to four times the peak rate with a single

layer.

The antenna array TX power is split between the beams. This means

that more beams equal less power for each beam.

## 3.5 Scheduling in Mid-Band

For more information on scheduling in mid-band, see Scheduler.

### 3.5.1 Scheduling Algorithm in Mid-Band

Summary

Resource-fair scheduling is used. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates

are sent to the mid-band scheduler. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based

on downlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on the

PUCCH scheduling request, the BSR, or prescheduling.

An increased number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities requires the support of

PDCCH resources. Downlink and uplink PDCCH scheduling entities are supported in each

slot and cell. In the downlink, link adaptation allows for processing scheduling

entities in each slot and cell.

The allocation of downlink and uplink scheduling entities in each slot provides the

opportunity to decrease the RTT latency when there are more connected users. Lower

latency can provide increased TCP throughput.

NR PDCCH Link Adaptation

The PDCCH Link Adaptation allocates CCEs for the DCI transmission based on the

channel quality and how the NRCellDU.pdcchLaSinrOffset parameter

is set. The PDCCH Link Adaptation uses higher aggregation levels to reduce coding

rate and extend PDCCH coverage. The PDCCH Link Adaptation can use lower aggregation

levels to avoid unnecessary PDCCH resource consumption, improving PDCCH

capacity.

### 3.5.2 Scheduling Request for Mid-Band

A Scheduling Request (SR) is used by the UE for requesting PUSCH resources for a new

PUSCH transmission.

In NR, the SR is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE level as in

LTE.

The MAC entity can be configured with zero, one, or more SRs. An SR configuration

consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SRs across different BWPs and cells. For each

logical channel, one PUCCH resource is configured per BWP for SRs.

The number of PRBs used for PUCCH format 1 is dynamically increased when there are many

connected UEs and more SR resources are necessary. To achieve this, PRBs initially used

for PUSCH are temporarily converted to PUCCH. This results in better uplink resource use

and higher PUSCH throughput when the number of connected UEs is lower.

Initially, one PUCCH PRB pair is available for SRs at cell unlock. When

SR resources from this first PRB pair are exhausted, more PRB pairs are configured

dynamically for PUCCH. PRBs are taken from PUSCH for this reason. UE grouping and 5QI

configuration are not considered in SR resource allocation.

For SR resource allocation, UEs can be assigned to the following SR

periodicity pools:

- Short
- Common
- Maximum

The process of assigning UEs to the SR periodicity pools is handled with the

following logic in the order of the UEs connecting to the network:

1. The first UE to connect to the network gets SR periodicity resources from the short SR periodicity pool.
2. If the short pool is exhausted, the UEs that connect afterward are assigned resources from the common SR periodicity pool.
3. If the common pool is exhausted, all further UEs that connect are assigned SR periodicity resources from the maximum SR periodicity pool.

By default, SRs have high priority. SR priority can be configured using the

QoS-controlled SR scheduling function of the QoS Framework feature.

### 3.5.3 Scheduling Channels

The feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink

channels.

CSI-RS is used for the TRS only

### 3.5.4 Scheduling Priority in Mid-Band

The feature determines which UEs are assigned resources in each slot of each

cell.

Scheduling is based on the scheduling weight attached to the DRBs. The user with the

longer scheduling delay is to be scheduled earlier.

HARQ

In NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the

uplink:

| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.     The number of HARQ processes is explicitly indicated in                                         DCI.   |
|----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Adaptive       |    | HARQ retransmission requires an uplink grant or a downlink                             assignment.                                                          |

HARQ ACK is sent on PUCCH and multiplexed on PUSCH, with or without uplink SCH.

### 3.5.5 Data Transmission

The feature

only supports a specific set of Time Division Duplex (TDD)

patterns.

In TDD, downlink and uplink are transmitted over the same frequency band. The resources

are divided in time on slot level between the uplink and the downlink.

The following TDD patterns are supported with special slot configurations for each

pattern:

- 3 downlink + 1 uplink (default)
- 4 downlink + 1 uplink
- 4 downlink + 1 uplink + 3 downlink + 2 uplink
- 4 downlink + 2 uplink + 4 downlink
- 8 downlink + 2 uplink

Figure 1   Supported TDD Patterns

A special slot can contain the following symbols:

- Downlink
- Uplink
- Guard

## 4.3 Scheduling in High-Band

For more information on scheduling in high-band, see Scheduler.

### 4.3.1 Scheduling Algorithm for High-Band

Summary

If the Priority-Controlled Scheduling and NR Relative

Priority Scheduling features are activated, resource-fair scheduling is used with

DRB priority. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates are sent

to the Scheduler High-Band feature. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based

on downlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on

PUCCH SR, BSR, or prescheduling.

The scheduling rank corresponds to the number of layers using the same TDD or FDD

resources. In High-Band, transmission ranks 1 and 2 are supported.

Link Adaptation

Link adaptation determines the amount of data that can be scheduled and the

conditions of scheduling. Such conditions include, for example, the used MCS, the

number of layers and precoding. Link adaptation occurs in each component carrier

when carrier aggregation is used.

Downlink decisions on the amount of scheduled data are based on reports from the UE.

These reports provide the gNodeB information on channel

quality and suggested scheduling rank. The gNodeB schedules

a symbol containing CSI-RS and CSI-IM for measurements in the downlink and

corresponding resources for reporting in the uplink. In addition to the reported CQI

and scheduling rank, the gNodeB also compensates for the

HARQ NACK ratio. Compensation occurs on original transmissions when selecting the

MCS.

In the uplink, decision on the number of layers, for UEs capable of

UL MIMO, is based on the following information:

- The rank reported by the UE, which is treated as an upper limitation
- Measured SINR and SINR difference between the layers

In transition to single-layer transmissions, for UEs capable of UL MIMO, the

SINR difference determines the layer to use.

Decisions on the amount of scheduled data are based on the following information:

- SINR measured on the used layer in single-layer transmissions
- The average SINR over two layers, in two-layer transmissions

All SINR measurements occur on PUSCH DMRS on each layer.

If the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active,

the number of PRBs allocated to the link adaptation CSI reports is decreased. This

ensures better reception of the link adaptation CSI reports. In addition, inner PRB

allocation is applied for PUSCH to reduce MPR. Inner PRB allocation for PUSCH takes

place when the number of scheduled PRBs is equal or less than one-third of the total

carrier bandwidth.

Scheduling Overlapping Symbols in SCells

In downlink slots, the CSI-RS and PDCCH symbols are often only transmitted on a

subset of the downlink carriers. The other carriers can instead be used to transmit

PDSCH data.

PDSCH data can only be transmitted to one UE for each slot, and the use of

overlapping symbols depends on three use cases. Since only one beam direction, at

the same time, can be applied for carriers mapped to one PAAM segment different

constraint are applied according to use cases.

The following use cases are available for this function:

- CSI-RS symbols for P2 Beam Tracking, with following constraints: Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the cell carrying CSI-RS information cannot be used. CSI-RS and PDSCH cannot be scheduled to the same UE for this use case.
- CSI-RS symbols for Link Adaptation, with following constraints Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the PSCell carrying CSI-RS information cannot be used, unless CSI-RS and PDSCH are scheduled to the same UE.
- PDCCH symbols for UL DCI, with following constraints Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the Cell carrying UL DCI information cannot be used, unless PDCCH and PDSCH are scheduled to the same UE.

Uplink Component Aggregation

Uplink component aggregation allows the configuration of multiple PSCells and up to

two SCells in the uplink. To configure up to three SCells in the uplink, carrier

aggregation with four component carriers must be supported. The bandwidth-dependent

scheduling limits determine the maximum number of scheduled SCells in the

uplink.

Downlink Component Aggregation

Downlink component aggregation allows for optimal downlink throughput and carrier

use. All downlink slots can use all carriers both for new data transmission and

retransmission purposes. The same downlink scheduling priority is assigned to new

data transmissions and retransmissions. New data and retransmission data are

co-scheduled with the following characteristics:

- In the same slot
- For the same UE candidate
- On different carriers

In this way, the scheduling use of the number of used carriers can be

increased. Also, fair slot distribution can be secured among devices with pending

downlink data but different HARQ NACK or downlink transmission rates.

Downlink component aggregation is supported with the available TDD patterns.

NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling

This function enables the radio unit to regulate the temperature pre-emptively. This

allows the operation to continue even when the ambient temperature or the load

exceeds operational limits.

If the radio unit detects that the internal temperature exceeds a threshold, it

requests the gNodeB to limit scheduling intensity

in downlink. This limit is based on the temperature in the radio unit.

The NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling function ensures that the high-band

scheduler does not exceed the PDSCH resources provided by the radio unit. Traffic

conditions can make the PDSCH slot use exceed the set maximum. In such cases, the

gNodeB forcefully blanks, that is, delays the

scheduling of some PDSCH slots. In this way, it conforms to the set limit. The

NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced PM counter is stepped

for each forcefully blanked slot.

The radio unit uses the blank slots to lower energy output. It utilizes the Micro

Sleep TX feature. Reduced energy consumption lowers the temperature of the radio

unit over time.

### 4.3.2 Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band

A Scheduling Request (SR) configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for

Scheduling Requests across different BWPs and cells. A Scheduling Request is used by the UE

to request PUSCH resources for a new PUSCH transmission.

In NR, the Scheduling Request is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE

level as in LTE.

When the UE has pending uplink data to transmit, it triggers a pending Scheduling

Request. The UE sends its pending Scheduling Request to the gNodeB in dedicated periodic

SR PUCCH format 0 resources.

The dedicated periodic SR PUCCH resources are configured by the gNodeB through the RRC.

The UE is configured to transmit the Scheduling Request on the SR PUCCH resources up to

64 times. It is possible that the UE fails to receive a scheduling grant despite the SR

PUCCH transmissions. In such cases, the UE schedules the Scheduling Request on

RACH.

Apart from transmitting the pending Scheduling Request on the periodic SR PUCCH resource,

the UE can also multiplex Scheduling Request information. Multiplexing occurs on a

HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource, overlapping in time. In this case, the UE performs the

following events:

- Multiplexes the Scheduling Request information into the HARQ-ACK information message.
- Transmits the Scheduling Request information on the HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource.
- Avoids transmission on the SR PUCCH resource.

The periodic SR PUCCH resource is set for four

or eight slots depending

on

the

TDD pattern. The gNodeB decodes the following types of PUCCH resources

to retrieve the Scheduling Request information:

- Periodic SR
- HARQ-ACK

The periodic SR PUCCH resource has the following characteristics:

- Supported for all High-Band patterns.
- Potentially decreases the latency of devices using Connected Mode DRX (C-DRX).
- It is decoded with dedicated periodic SR PUCCH resources.
- The following specific RRC configuration parameters are provided to the UE: Periodicity Cyclic shift PRB

The periodic SR PUCCH resource can be multiplexed on aperiodic HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources.

Different devices handle the periodic SR PUCCH resource differently, depending on their

capabilities. HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources constitute either one or two slots.

Service-adaptive SR periodicity configurations can reduce

PUCCH decoding rate for non-time-critical services to prioritize PUCCH decoding on

latency-critical services.

The following counters are introduced for the measurement of the periodic SR PUCCH

resource:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSrNote: It is possible that the UE fails to access the node by the Scheduling Request over PUCCH. In such cases, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter counts the number of received Scheduling Requests over RACH. With the Improved Periodic SR function, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is updated to count the number of times an SR on RACH triggers RRC reconfiguration to restore normal scheduling. To maintain observability for the number of RRC reconfigurations on RACH for each C-RNTI, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr PM counter is introduced.
- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlUnresUePucchSrGrant
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistrNote: When the value of the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is abnormally high, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr counter can be checked to determine if this is caused by UE behavior or radio conditions.

The Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function can affect the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr counter.

Existing

scheduling serves a significant part of uplink traffic with MCS 0 when uplink traffic is

low. This occurs when the gNodeB preschedules UEs in the following conditions:

- UEs inactive during beam management
- UEs active immediately after data transmission in the downlink or in the uplink

In such cases, the gNodeB uses MCS 0, as it is not aware if the UE has pending

uplink data to transmit. The Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function allows

non-active UEs to be scheduled directly on the MCS most suitable for the UE, as the

gNodeB is aware of its pending uplink data. In cells with good radio conditions, this

results in more pegs on higher MCSs in the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr counter.

This function also affects the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb

counter. Physical restrictions over the air interface can prohibit the

gNodeB from serving the UE with an uplink grant within the

short latency this function introduces. These physical restrictions can manifest in

radio conditions that prevent RACH resources from reaching the gNodeB. In such cases, the gNodeB

releases the UE from SCG radio resources and pegs the

NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter. After this, the UE can

reattach to the network with normal handling.

To minimize impact on the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter due

to feature activation, the settings recommended by Ericsson must be used for the above

parameters, as frequently using MCG radio resources can cause unwanted drops. For more

information, see RAN Parameter Recommendations List.

If the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active, the

Scheduling Request PUCCH resource allocation is moved to the inner region of the

bandwidth to reduce MPR.

### 4.3.3 Scheduling Priority

The feature determines which UEs are assigned resources in each slot of each

cell.

Scheduling is based on the scheduling weight attached to the PRBs. The user with the

longer scheduling delay is to be scheduled earlier. If

the Priority-Controlled Scheduling and NR Relative Priority Scheduling features are

activated, priority can be configured on a DRB level. As a result, the scheduling weight

is a combination of the user DRB priority and waiting time.

HARQ

In NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the

uplink:

| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.     The number of HARQ processes is explicitly indicated in                                         DCI.   |
|----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Adaptive       |    | HARQ retransmission requires an uplink grant or a downlink                             assignment.                                                          |

HARQ ACK is sent on PUCCH.

The HARQ procedure is also used for Msg3 PUSCH. Msg3 HARQ has the following

characteristics:

- It triggers the UE to attempt Msg3 retransmission during the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer.
- It is determined by DCI 0\_0.

### 4.3.4 Scheduling Channels

The feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink

channels.

### 4.3.5 Beam Management

The Scheduler High-Band feature is involved in beam management for resource and

report scheduling.

There are three procedures for establishing a wide beam to track the best narrow beam.

These procedures are the following:

- Beam establishment
- gNodeB beam refinement and Advanced P2/gNodeB tracking
- UE beam refinement and tracking

| Procedure                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Figure 3   Example of Beam Refinement from Wide to Narrow Beam

Beam Establishment

The SSB beam sweeps occur on wide beams. The UE measures the SSBs and selects the

best SSB beam. This SSB beam is used to send the random access preamble on the

random access occasion that maps to the respective wide beams of the chosen SSB. The

procedure is also called beam acquisition.

The Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band can

help with connection establishment. If this feature is active, the PDCCH power of

the following messages can be boosted:

- Msg2
- Msg3 retransmission grant
- Msg4 grant
- Initial P2 refinement

The PRBs of the PDSCH are moved to the center and the coverage of Msg2 can also

be boosted.

gNodeB Beam Refinement and Advanced P2/gNodeB Tracking

After the finalization of the random access procedure, beam refinement is triggered.

CSI resources and CSI reports are scheduled, one for each narrow beam in the

selected wide beam. The gNodeB sets the CSI

request field to the aperiodic trigger state entry that corresponds to the selected

wide beam. The narrow beam CSI resources can be distributed in the following

ways:

- Split into two different resource sets scheduled in two consecutive downlink slots (12 CSI-RS symbols)
- Scheduled in one resource set of a single slot (six or seven CSI-RS symbols)

A corresponding CSI report is scheduled in the uplink, based on the selected

number of CSI resource sets and containing the following elements:

- One RSRP measurement result for each resource set in case of 12 CSI-RS symbols
- Two RSRP measurement results for the single resource set in case of six or seven CSI-RS symbols

The number of used CSI-RS symbols determine the number of CSI-RS slots for beam

tracking.

Table 16   CSI-RS Slot Configuration

| Number of CSI-RS Symbols   |   Number of Configured CSI-RS Slots |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 12                         |                                   2 |
| 6 or 7                     |                                   1 |

There can be OFDM symbols which do not overlap with CSI-RS symbols in the

slot. These symbols are used for PDSCH scheduling in Primary Cells and all available

Secondary Cells. Symbols on Secondary cells, overlapping CSI-RS symbols on Primary

cell, are also used for PDSCH scheduling when possible as described in Scheduling Algorithm for High-Band.

In the course of beam refinement, a CSI-RS resource indicator (CRI) is delivered with the best RSRP measurement result of both reports.

The CRI with the best RSRP measurement result of both reports is used subsequently

for the following purposes in the given order:

- Triggering a link adaptation measurement
- Beginning data scheduling

Narrow beam tracking is performed within the following beam configurations:

- Current wide beam
- Current wide beam including neighboring narrow beams of other wide beams
- Another wide beam

In case of CSI resource and CSI report scheduling, the best SSB is measured.

When a new best SSB is found, a CSI-RS narrow beam measurement is performed within

that SSB.

The SSB Power Boost feature can increase SSB

transmission power in High-Band. Increased SSB transmission power reduces the

received power difference between wide and narrow beams. In this way, the SSB Power Boost feature can improve gNodeB

beam refinement.

UE Beam Refinement and Tracking

The UE can perform beam refinement based on SSB and TRS. There are

three

symbols with DMRS

in

every SSB period.

During

this

time,

the UE can evaluate

three

beams. Aperiodic CSI-RS can be scheduled for the UE to perform UE beam

refinement.
