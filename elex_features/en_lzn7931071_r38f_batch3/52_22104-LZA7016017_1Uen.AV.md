Summary

The uplink SINR measurements determine the type of waveform used in the uplink.

The measured uplink SINR can deteriorate. If this state persists over a period of time,

dynamic waveform switching becomes possible. Switching occurs from the Cyclic

Prefix-OFDM (CP-OFDM) to the Discrete Fourier Transform Spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)

waveform.

Only single-port, single-layer transmissions are supported with the DFT-s-OFDM waveform, so

for UEs configured with two-layer uplink transmissions, a single-port

reconfiguration is also included in the waveform switch. Switching to DFT-s-OFDM

type allows for better cell coverage and improves the retainability of SCG radio

resources.

Using a single port with the DFT-s-OFDM waveform enables transmission with higher power, as

lower power backoff is required. When the uplink SINR improves over a period of

time, switching back to the CP-OFDM waveform and to two uplink TX ports (for UEs

capable of two uplink layers) becomes possible.

Uplink waveform switching occurs on the following conditions:

- RRC reconfiguration is used.
- The DFT-s-OFDM waveform is supported.

- The following attributes related to the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band and the High Speed UE High-Band features cannot be configured for the same High-Band cell at the same time: NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed

Network Requirements

The feature requires an EN-DC- or NR-DC-capable UE.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band

The feature introduces dynamic waveform switching in the uplink with the coordinated

operation of layer switching and radio resource switching.

In High-Band, the uplink switching options are determined by the functions enabled in the

different coverage areas. In SCG coverage, two different coverage areas

constitute different channel quality conditions. NR PUSCH transmission occurs in both

areas.

Table 2   Coverage Areas in NR

| Area Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Area 1      | Involves good channel quality conditions. In this area, the UE is the                                 closest to the Secondary Node antenna. Two-port transmissions can                                 occur over one or two layers if the UE is capable of two ports. Only                                 the CP-OFDM waveform can be used, waveform switching is not                                 supported. |
| Area 2      | The UE is farther from the Secondary Node antenna. In this area,                                 channel quality conditions are not as favorable as in area 1. The                                 following characteristics apply to this area:  Single-layer transmission only     Waveform switching from the CP-OFDM to the DFT-s-OFDM is                                             supported                 |

Area 3 is outside of the SCG coverage. It is determined on the boundary of area 2 and

area 3 (Master Node) if transmission occurs with MCG or SCG radio resources. Switching

to DFT-s-OFDM while transmitting SCG radio resources provides a suitable buffer before

switching to the transmission of MCG radio resources.

Dynamic waveform switching occurs on the boundary of area 1 and area 2. In such cases,

enhanced High-Band uplink link adaptation is supported when channel quality conditions

are less than optimal.

Figure 1   Coverage Areas Based on Channel Quality Conditions

Uplink SINR measurements determine the preferred type of waveform used and the number of

uplink TX ports. Ports for uplink switching refer to SRS ports configured by RRC

messages. Dynamic waveform switching uses the same measurements as uplink layer

switching.

Operational Process

Dynamic waveform switching is triggered when the UE is in poor SCG coverage for a

longer period of time. The prohibit timer for dynamic waveform switching begins

after the following events occur:

- The UE attaches to the network.
- Signaling for switching initiation is received.

The following conditions apply to dynamic waveform switching:

- RRC reconfiguration is mandatory
- Supported if scheduling occurs in the PSCell only
- Allowed only if the UE supports it

The

feature supports carrier aggregation with 2CC in the uplink.

The feature can be configured by setting the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute to

true. The decision to switch waveforms in the uplink is made on

the basis of the following information:

- SINR-based thresholds to measure switching point
- Dynamic waveform switching measurements to determine the time of switching
- Hysteresis- and timer-based measurements

If the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute is enabled, the

following configuration values cannot be configured for the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute:

- UP\_TO\_50KMPH
- UP\_TO\_100KMPH

The NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh attribute allows to

configure the threshold which determines the waveform type the UE uses upon initial

setup and during PSCell change. Subsequent UE connection setups can be resulted by

switching from the use of SCG to MCG radio resources. In such cases, the selected

waveform type corresponds to the latest used waveform type before SCG radio

resources are lost.

The RSRP measurement of the UE can be lower than the configured threshold of the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh attribute. In this

case, the UE uses the DFT-s-OFDM waveform. Otherwise, the UE uses the CP-OFDM

waveform.

Switching from DFT-s-OFDM to CP-OFDM is triggered when the UE is in good SCG

coverage. This is achieved if the SINR is above the sum of the SINR threshold and

the SINR hysteresis values.

The quality of MCG radio resources is not evaluated before the uplink switching of

radio resources. The good quality of MCG radio resources must be ensured by the

mobility procedures determined by the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs.

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band

The feature improves uplink coverage in High-Band.

Capacity and Performance

The feature allows for coverage enhancement in single-layer SCG radio resource

transmissions. This provides the following benefits while the UE is in less

favorable SCG coverage:

- Better cell coverage
- Improves the retainability of SCG radio resources

Switching to the DFT-s-OFDM waveform in case of single-layer, single-port

uplink transmissions provides better coverage for UEs on the cell edge.

Interfaces

No interfaces are impacted by this feature.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q4: Enhanced Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band

This feature enhancement involves the introduction of an attribute, the use of an

additional event and a number of PM counters.

| Feature Name:           | Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5145                                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Coverage Extension                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4006                                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                |
| Access Type:            | NR                                                 |

The NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh attribute allows configuring

the threshold which determines the waveform type the UE uses upon initial setup.

The RSRP B1 measurement of the UE can be lower than the configured threshold of the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh attribute. In this case,

the UE uses the Discrete Fourier Transform Spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform. Otherwise,

the UE uses the Cyclic Prefix-OFDM (CP-OFDM) waveform.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement introduces the following PM counters for the feature:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacCpofdmTransUl
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacDftsTransUl
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlCpofdm
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlDfts
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlCpofdm
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlDfts

In addition, the feature uses the DUPerRadioCellMeasurement

event to measure the radio environment of the cell periodically.

Operation

The NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh attribute is introduced

for this feature.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.15 or later is required for the feature to

operate.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q2: Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band Configuration Update

The feature enhancement introduces a rule that prevents configuring two attributes at

the same time.

| Feature Name:           | Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band   | High Speed UE High-Band   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5145                                       | FAJ 121 5017              |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Coverage Extension                        | NR Base Package           |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4006                                       | FAJ 801 4002              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type:            | NR                                                 | NR                        |

The Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band and the High Speed UE High-Band

features are not compatible with each other. To avoid enabling a faulty configuration,

the configuration update introduces a rule that prevents configuring the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled and the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attributes at the same time.

Benefits

The configuration update prevents a faulty configuration on Baseband nodes.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement prevents performance degradation by introducing the

configuration update.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces a rule which affects the following parameters:

- NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled
- NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed

The above attributes cannot be configured for the same High-Band cell at the same

time. When the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute is

enabled, the following configuration values are not allowed for the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute:

- UP\_TO\_50KMPH
- UP\_TO\_100KMPH

The rule is enabled by default, and it does not affect pre-existing attribute

configurations that conflict with each other. When the rule is triggered, an error

message is displayed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

## Appendix A.c: 23.Q1: Inter-gNodeB Target PSCell RSRP-based Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band

This feature enhancement introduces support for target PSCell RSRP based waveform

configuration of uplink SCG radio resources during Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node

Change in the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature.

| Feature Name           | Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band   |

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5145                                       |
| Value Package Name     | Advanced Coverage Extension                        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4006                                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                |
| Access Type            | NR                                                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                           |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, RSRP in measurement report for target PSCell is

compared against NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh configured in target PSCell

during Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Change to target PSCell with

Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature active.

This feature enhancement improves SCG throughput during and directly after Secondary

Node Initiated Secondary Node Change. Additionally, waveform switch to CP-OFDM on

uplink SCG radio resources directly after Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node

Change can be avoided.

Capacity and Performance

Before this feature enhancement, UEs were set up with DFT-s-OFDM waveform in uplink

on SCG radio resources if NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled was true in target PSCell

during Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Change irrespective of the radio

conditions.

In good enough radio conditions for target PSCell with Coverage-Optimized Uplink

Transmission High-Band active, this resulted in a waveform switch to CP-OFDM on

uplink SCG radio resources directly after Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node

Change and reduced SCG throughput.

After this feature enhancement, the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh configured

in target PSCell is considered during Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Change

in a similar way as during Secondary Node Addition.

A consequence of this is that fewer UEs will be configured with DFT-s-OFDM on the

uplink SCG radio resources during Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Change and

fewer waveform switches to CP-OFDM will be triggered directly after the inter-gNodeB

PSCell change to a PSCell with Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission for High-Band

feature activated.

The following PM counters are expected to decrease:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacDftsTransUl
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlCpofdm
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlCpofdm

The following PM counter is expected to increase:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacCpofdmTransUl

The following PM counters can increase:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlDfts
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlDfts

Operation

Ensure feature Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band is active in

High-Band cells intended as target cells for Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node

Change.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q4: Target PSCell RSRP-Based Waveform Configuration Support for Intra-gNodeB PSCell Change

This feature enhancement introduces support for target PSCell RSRP-based waveform

configuration of uplink SCG radio resources during intra-gNodeB PSCell change in the

Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature in EN-DC deployments.

| Feature Name           | Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band   |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement is applicable from the 23.Q1 release, where the description

was missing. This description is related to 23.Q1: Inter-gNodeB Target PSCell

RSRP-based Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band.

With this feature enhancement, the RSRP in the measurement report for the target

PSCell is compared against the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh attribute configured in

the target PSCell. This comparison is done during intra-gNodeB PSCell change to the

target PSCell with the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature

active.

This feature enhancement also changes SCG throughput during and directly after

intra-gNodeB PSCell change. Additionally, waveform switch to CP-OFDM on uplink SCG

radio resources directly after intra-gNodeB PSCell change can be avoided.

Capacity and Performance

Before this improvement, UEs were set up with DFT-s-OFDM waveform in uplink on SCG

radio resources during intra-gNodeB PSCell change irrespective of the radio

conditions if the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute was set

to true in the target PSCell. In good enough radio conditions, for

the target PSCell with the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature

active, this resulted in a waveform switch to CP-OFDM on uplink SCG radio resources

directly after intra-gNodeB PSCell change, and reduced SCG throughput.

After this improvement, the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschStartRsrpThresh

attribute configured in the target PSCell is considered during intra-gNodeB PSCell

change in a similar way as during Secondary Node Addition. As a result, fewer UEs

are configured with DFT-s-OFDM on the uplink SCG radio resources during intra-gNodeB

PSCell change. Additionally, fewer waveform switches to CP-OFDM are triggered

directly after intra-gNodeB PSCell change to a PSCell with the Coverage-Optimized

Uplink Transmission for High-Band feature activated.

The following PM counters are expected to decrease:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacDftsTransUl
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlCpofdm
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlCpofdm

The NRCellDU.pmRadioMacCpofdmTransUl PM counter is expected to

increase.

The following PM counters can increase:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlDfts
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlDfts

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
