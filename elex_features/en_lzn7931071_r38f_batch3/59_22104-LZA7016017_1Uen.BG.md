Hardware

For supported hardware and configurations, see the Radio Node

Configurations library.

Limitations

- Up to four devices can be coscheduled with a maximum of eight layers for each cell.
- The scheduling of the feature for each slot might not be possible in more than one cell simultaneously. The scheduling depends on the number of cells, cell bandwidth, and cell load.
- The feature can only be activated for cells operating with Massive MIMO radio units with an eCPRI interface.
- With codebook configuration (8, 2) or (8, 1), the maximum number of layers each coscheduled UE is limited to two. In case of MU-MIMO, UE reported rank-4 and rank-3 are overridden to two.
- With codebook configuration (4, 4), the maximum number of layers each coscheduled UE is limited to two. UEs with rank-3 or rank-4 report are excluded in MU-MIMO coscheduling.
- With codebook-based line of sight pairing, each coscheduled UE is limited to a maximum of two layers.
- The feature is not supported for external carrier aggregation, only for local carrier aggregation.

For more information regarding the limitations and codebook configurations, see Manage Massive MIMO NR.

Network Requirements

- For the feature to operate, the NRCellDU.dlMaxMuMimoLayers attribute must be set to a value greater than 0 but less than or equal to 8. The feature supports up to eight layers.
- As the feature can only use specific codebook configurations, the following attributes need to be set accordingly: NRCellDU.csiRsConfig16P NRCellDU.csiRsConfig32P

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

The feature calculates orthogonality and coschedules the devices in each downlink

slot.

The orthogonality of UEs is calculated on the basis of their CSI feedback. On such basis,

two or more devices can be paired to improve cell

throughput.

Operational Process

1. The gNodeB periodically sends CSI-RS resources to the connected devices.
2. The UEs send CSI feedback to the gNodeB.
3. The orthogonality of UEs is calculated by the gNodeB, on the basis of CSI feedback.
4. The multi-user coscheduling of UEs is performed by the gNodeB, based on CSI feedback.

To be paired, UEs must be spread across the cell with minimum angular separation.

## 3.1 Deployment Scenarios of Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

To experience the most benefit, it is recommended to deploy the feature in the following

sites:

- Higher load, for example single-user MIMO with close to 100% PRB utilization.
- Sites with higher probability of line of sight.
- Sites with large inter-site distances.

# 4 Network Impact of Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

The feature increases network capacity and performance with beamforming.

Capacity and Performance

The

Downlink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature increases the network performance by using beamforming and

coscheduling.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

If the feature is enabled, the lower rank-3 and rank-4 distribution of downlink

transmissions can be observed. This is because of the reduced rank is used for

Multi-User MIMO transmissions of UEs with rank-3 and rank-4 report.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

network.

## Appendix A.a: 23.Q4: MU-MIMO-Friendly Scheduler

The feature enhancement optimizes the scheduler to make better coscheduling decisions

for MU-MIMO, which might improve the average downlink cell throughput in cells where the

advanced or codebook-based MU-MIMO features are

enabled.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement optimizes the scheduler to provide more opportunities for UEs

that are scheduled as MU-MIMO except for the UE with the highest scheduling priority

in the MU-MIMO group. The feature enhancement does not affect UEs that are scheduled

as SU-MIMO.

The feature enhancement only supports resource fair scheduling. For more information

on resource fair scheduling, see Scheduling Algorithm in Mid-Band in

Manage Massive MIMO NR.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- More opportunities are provided for MU-MIMO coscheduling.
- Average downlink cell throughput might increase.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on MU-MIMO utilization and the number of UEs that can be scheduled as

SU-MIMO or MU-MIMO in the cell, the feature enhancement might increase the average

downlink cell throughput by increasing PDSCH utilization in MU-MIMO.

Operation

If carrier aggregation is enabled, the

NRCellDU.caPerCcFairnessWeightEnabled attribute must be set

to TRUE in order for the feature enhancement to be beneficial for

carrier aggregation-capable UEs. The feature enhancement is only applicable in the

PCell carrier of the carrier aggregation configuration.

The NRCellDU.caPerCcFairnessWeightEnabled attribute can be used

with any number of component carriers.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is supported on all RAN Compute groups.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.
