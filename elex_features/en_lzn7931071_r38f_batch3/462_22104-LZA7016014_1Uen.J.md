Summary

The LMT Port Disabling feature enables the operators to lock all accesses on LMT interface, to

prevent unauthorized access to the Baseband Radio Node.

The LMT interface provides local access to the Baseband Radio Node in case the remote

OMC connection is lost. LMT interface is considered as a last resort of access when

no other access means are available. Disabling all access through LMT can result

that the Baseband Radio Node becomes unreachable for the operator. For this reason,

LMT Port Disabling feature is restricted and is not recommended for use, unless

explicitly demanded by the operator.

The access is controlled remotely by the OMC, with the MO attributes of the

LocalAccess MOC. The SSH, TLS, and web access (TCP port 443)

are handled separately. SSH and TLS access can be locked in any order. Web access

can only be locked, if both SSH and TLS access are already locked.

The already disabled LMT port can only be enabled remotely by OMC, or on-site with the board

restore procedure. The lock of web access is only supported on Baseband Radio Nodes

equipped with a physical restore button.

# 2 Dependencies of LMT Port Disabling

Features

There are no dependencies to other features.

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

Hardware

Baseband Radio Nodes with physical restore button provide full support of the

feature. Baseband Radio Nodes without restore button do not support the locking of

web access through LMT.

# 3 Feature Operation of LMT Port Disabling

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Process Steps

To activate the LMT Port Disabling feature, System Security Administrator role is

required for the OMC.

1. Lock the SSH access of the LMT port, by setting the LocalAccess.administrativeState attribute of the LocalAccess=cmSsh MO instance to LOCKED.
2. Lock the TLS access of the LMT port, by setting the LocalAccess.administrativeState attribute of the LocalAccess=cmTls MO instance to LOCKED. Note: Locking the SSH or TLS access can be performed in any order.
3. Lock the web access of the LMT port, by setting the LocalAccess.administrativeState attribute of the LocalAccess=web MO instance to LOCKED. Note: Locking the web access is only possible for Baseband Radio Nodes with physical restore button.

To re-open LMT port, perform the previous steps in reversed order and set the

attributes to UNLOCKED.

In case the O&amp;M connection to the Baseband Radio Node is lost and cannot be

recovered, the node can only be recovered by performing board restore procedure. For

details see Engineering Guidelines for LMT Port Disabling.

# 4 Network Impact of LMT Port Disabling

Capacity and Performance

No impact is expected from this feature.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

# 5 Parameters for LMT Port Disabling

The LMT Port Disabling feature

introduces a new MOC, LocalAccess under the SecM and

LocalAccessM MO classes. The system generates three instances of the

LocalAccess MOC: LocalAccess=cmSsh,

LocalAccess=cmTls and LocalAccess=web.

Table 1   Parameters

| Parameter                       | Type       | Description          |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| LocalAccess.administrativeState | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LocalAccess.operationalState    | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LocalAccess.localAccessId       | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LocalAccess.userLabel           | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of LMT Port Disabling

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate LMT Port Disabling

Prerequisites

The license key is installed in the node.

The license category is the following: SPECIAL FEATURES I (Permanently Restricted).

The license is not part of any value package and the operator has to request this

license.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance, depending on node type: Node Type License Control MO Baseband Radio Node FeatureState=CXC4012363
2. Check if the attribute licenseState is ENABLED in the applicable MO instance.
3. Check if serviceState attribute is OPERABLE on the applicable MO instance.

# 8 Deactivate LMT Port Disabling

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance, depending on node type: Node Type License Control MO Baseband Radio Node FeatureState=CXC4012363

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LMT Port Disabling

Desired Configuration for LMT Port Disabling

When the LMT Port Disabling feature is active, all access through the LMT port is

locked. TN port remain open for O&amp;M traffic and make it possible for the OMC to

unlock the LMT port remotely.

TN Port Not Accessible

In case the TN port becomes inaccessible while LMT port is disabled, Baseband Radio

Node LMT port can be unlocked only through the board restore procedure. This is

performed with the physical board restore button and is only recommended as a last

resort recovery action. After board restore, the LMT port and TN port are accessible

again and the Baseband Radio Node requires reintegration in the network.

## 9.1 Repair of Baseband Radio Nodes with Locked LMT Port

In case a Baseband Radio Node that has the LMT Port Disabling feature activated and

has to be sent to Ericsson for repair, the following procedure must be completed.

Unlock the LMT port before the Baseband Radio Node is sent to the repair center as

is described in Feature Operation of LMT Port Disabling.

If a Baseband Radio Node is suspected to be faulty following a node lockout and a

subsequent restore and reintegration, the following is action is required. Restore

the Baseband Radio Node as described in TN Port Not Accessible. LMT port must be unlocked,

before the Baseband Radio Node is sent to Ericsson repair center.
