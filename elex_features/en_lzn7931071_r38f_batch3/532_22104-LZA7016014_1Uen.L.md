| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

Timing Advance (TA) can give a rough indication of the distance between the UE and

the cell antenna, making it possible to identify where the UE was located at a

certain time and correlate the UE position information with other collected

information for statistical use.

# 2 Dependencies of UE Location Information in Traces

Features

There are no dependencies to other features.

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Events

Table 1   Events

| Event                   | Event Parameter          | Description                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| DuPerRadioUeMeasurement | per_ue_nr_timing_advance | NR Timing Advance value, see 3GPP TS 38.211 |

# 7 Activate UE Location Information in Traces

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) has been active for at least one week. This ensures availability of troubleshooting data in case of errors.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState= CXC4012562 MO instance. The featureState takes effect immediately on ongoing connections

After This Task

Let the CCTR be active for one week, for continued collection of troubleshooting

data.

# 8 Deactivate UE Location Information in Traces

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) has been active for at least one week. This ensures availability of troubleshooting data in case of errors.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState= CXC4012562 MO instance. The featureState takes effect immediately on ongoing connections

After This Task

Let the CCTR be active for one week, for continued collection of troubleshooting

data.
