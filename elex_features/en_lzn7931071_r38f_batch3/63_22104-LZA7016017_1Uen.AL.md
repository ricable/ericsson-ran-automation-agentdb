# 1 Fronthaul Sharing Overview

The feature introduces a

360-degree or

240-degree cell solution with reduced number of optical fiber cables to

the site.

| Feature Name           | Fronthaul Sharing                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5213                                             |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Access Type            | NR                                                       |
| Licensing              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature enables a solution where only two optical fiber cables connect the radios to the

Baseband. The 360-degree or 240-degree cell is made up of a sector that consists of

maximum three radios connected to each other in cascade.

The

solution

does not allow simultaneous transmission to and from the different radios. Each

radio transmits or receives data only when it is addressed. Thus, the cell bandwidth

requirement can be met by using only two optical fiber cables to the site.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Cost reduction by decreasing the number of CPRI cables to the site from six to two, while retaining the maximum bandwidth capacity for one radio at a time.
- When more capacity is needed on the site, the three already mounted radios can be reconfigured to three individual radios. However, this configuration needs six CPRI cables.
- Switching downlink radio resources from SCG to MCG and then back to another SCG is not needed within the cell, even if the UE moves across radio borders.
- Support for 24 wide beams in NR high-band cells improves coverage and service area.

# 2 Dependencies of Fronthaul Sharing

The feature is associated with hardware support features, and it is

supported for both EN-DC- and NR-DC-configured UEs.

Hardware

The feature is supported with two or three identical cascaded units of AIR 1281, AIR

5322, and Indoor AIR 1279.

The use of 24.3 Gbps CPRI line rate is necessary to obtain full fronthaul sharing

capacity.

Limitations

The supported length of the CPRI cables is up to 13 km between the Baseband and the

first radio. The cabling distance between the first and the last AIR unit is less

than 200 m, regardless of the number of the AIR units in the deployment.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Fronthaul Sharing

This feature introduces a fronthaul sharing solution to support up to three AIR units

configured to reduce the number of fibers to the site. The solution also supports the

configuration of two cascaded radio units. In this case, the service area covers 240

degrees.

An NRSectorCarrier MO in a sector that is mapped to two or three AIR

units. These AIR units all have to be parts of the same

SectorEquipmentFunction MO.

Figure 1   Omni Cell Service Area with Pole Installation

The system groups radio resources mapped to each of the AIR units to common streams

towards the Baseband unit.

The Baseband unit then transmits or receives on a certain beam in a certain radio. Each

radio that transmits individual beams, has a coverage of 120Â°.

The cascading directions can be set at

SectorEquipmentFunction.radioEquipmentOrdering attribute. The

default value is COUNTER\_CLOCKWISE. The CPRI cascade chain can have the

following directions:

- Counterclockwise around the pole with three cascaded AIR units, creating an omnicell service area
- Clockwise around the pole with three cascaded AIR units, creating an omnicell service area
- Left to right with two or three adjacent cascading AIR units
- Right to left with two or three adjacent cascading AIR units
- Non-adjacent cascaded radio units

The CPRI links from the Baseband unit are connected to data port 1 and 3 on the first

AIR unit and reach the next AIR unit on data port 2 and 4.

Mixing SFPs supporting different link speeds is not supported. All SFPs  in the complete

cascade chain must be of the same type.

Fault Handling

If an AIR unit experiences a fault in the cascading chain, the cell service is

degraded or unavailable, depending on the fault and the location on the unit in the

cascaded chain.

The cell service is degraded in the following cases:

- If the penultimate or last AIR unit is locked, or experiences a fault. Faults can be hardware fault, permanent power loss, link, or SFP failure or critical temperature. In this case, the preceding operational AIR provides cell service.
- If any AIR unit experiences a partial hardware fault or reports overheating, the remaining operational AIR units provide cell service.
- If one or more AIR units do not start up or are unavailable when the node is started or a locked SectorEquipmentFunction MO is unlocked, preceding operational units provide cell service.

The cell service is unavailable if the first AIR unit is locked, or experiences a

fault. Faults can be hardware fault, permanent power loss, link, or SFP failure or

critical temperature.

An alarm is raised to identify the faulty or late starting unit and the nature of the

fault.

When a previously unavailable AIR unit becomes operational, the alarm is ceased. If

all AIR units are unlocked and operational, full cell service is regained

automatically after a traffic interrupt. No manual release or traffic reactivation

is needed.

Antenna Segmentation

In a fronthaul sharing deployment, the antenna segmentation is supported for AIR 1281

and AIR 5322 with the configuration modes shown in Table 2.

Table 2   Configuration Modes

| AIR Unit   | Configuration Mode                                |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AIR 1281   | Configuration Mode 1 with 8CC , 800 MHz bandwidth |
| AIR 1281   | Configuration Mode 2 with 4CC , 400 MHz bandwidth |
| AIR 5322   | Configuration Mode 1 with 8CC , 800 MHz bandwidth |

It is required to set the same AasData.antSegmentation in the

AasData MO under the Transceiver MO for

each fronthaul sharing unit associated with the NRSectorCarrier

MO. The system sets the used antenna segmentation

inAasData.usedAntSegmentation for each fronthaul sharing

unit.

24 Wide Beams

Support for 24 wide beams in NR high-band cells is included to help improve coverage

and service area. This also provides additional flexibility for certain radio

configurations and deployment scenarios where a larger number of wide beams are

desired.

For information on configuring 24 wide beams, see instructions in Physical Layer High-Band.

3. Create one or more instances of the RiPort MO on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO that represents the superior unit, which is either a Baseband unit, or a radio unit in a cascade chain.
4. Connect the RiPort MO instances Data1 and Data3 on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO for the radio unit with either of the following: Note: The names of the RiPort MO instances must reflect the names of the ports to which the cable is connected. See Figure 2.
    - Any two available RiPort MO instances on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO for the Baseband unit.
    - RiPort MO instances Data2 and Data4 on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO for a radio unit.
5. Lock the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
6. Set two or three SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes to the Transceiver MO instances for the cascaded radio units, depending on the number of the cascaded units in the sector with the list of SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef matching the position of the radio unit in the cascade chain.
