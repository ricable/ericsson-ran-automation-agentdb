Summary

Uplink EN-DC aggregation is enabled when the amount of available uplink data exceeds the set

threshold. The feature is supported only on devices capable of uplink EN-DC

aggregation. The Secondary Node terminated MCG and SCG DRBs can be used separately,

with a time-based configuration.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improved uplink user throughput.
- Improved inter-node load balancing.

# 2 Dependencies of LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

The LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation feature affects the performance of both uplink and

downlink throughput.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Network Requirements

The feature requires an EN-DC-capable UE.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

The feature allows the simultaneous uplink data transfer from the UE to both the MCG and

the SCG radio resources.

If the amount of available uplink data exceeds the threshold

configured

through the

UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg

attribute, the uplink aggregation is activated for the EN-DC-capable UE. When the uplink

buffer amount is less than the

threshold

value, the uplink data is transferred on the primary path.

When the Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature is activated, different

configurations can be used for each 5QI, which can be configured with the

CUCP5qi.endcUlDataSplitRef and the

CUCP5qi.nrdcUlDataSplitRef attributes,

for

EN-DC and

NR-DC,

respectively. The CUCP5qi.endcUlDataSplitRef

attribute references a UlDataSplit MO instance, which is the parent

MO class of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute. If

the Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature is deactivated, the following MO

instances are applied for all CUCP5qi MO instances for EN-DC and

NR-DC,

respectively, instead of the referenced instances:

- UlDataSplit=Default\_endc
- UlDataSplit=Default\_nrdc

For more information, see Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. During the EN-DC Setup or NR-DC Setup procedure, the Secondary Node sends the uplink configuration including the uplink data threshold to the UE through the Master Node. Note: If the UE is not capable of data split, the threshold is set to infinity.
2. If the uplink data threshold is exceeded, the UE sends uplink PDCP Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to both the MCG and the SCG radio resource. If the threshold is not exceeded, the uplink data is transferred on the primary path.
3. The Secondary Node sends the aggregated uplink data to the Core Network.

documentation:

- NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## 3.1 Coverage-Controlled Uplink PDCP Aggregation for EN-DC

Coverage-controlled uplink PDCP aggregation for EN-DC enables the configuration of

different uplink data split thresholds depending on the primary data path.

The ul-DataSplitThreshold

IE

sent to the UE is set in the following ways:

- According to the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute, if the SCG radio resources are used as the primary data path
- According to the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute, if the MCG radio resources are used as the primary data path

The function allows uplink EN-DC aggregation to be disabled when the MCG radio resources

are used as the primary data path. This means that the UE does not send any uplink PDCP

data on the SCG radio resources if the quality of those resources is poor.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

The feature can improve uplink data throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves uplink user data throughput if it is enabled on uplink EN-DC

aggregation-capable devices.

If the feature is activated, the traffic that would be sent on one NR RAT or LTE RAT

can be sent on both NR and LTE RATs. This might increase PDCP reordering delays that

introduce pauses in uplink NR and LTE traffic. As a result, uplink throughput might

decrease and signaling might increase, affecting end-user downlink throughput.

Especially TCP ramp-ups, TCP throughput, and TCP stability might be affected.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

## 9.1 Configuration of LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

Uplink PDCP aggregation must be configured properly for optimal

functioning.

Uplink Data Split Threshold Configuration

The uplink data split threshold is configured through the

UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg

and the

UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg

attributes. Different configurations of these attributes have the following

effects:

- A value of -1 prohibits the UE from splitting uplink data.
- A high value ensures lower latency for shorter user data transmissions. This is because no uplink PDCP reordering is required between different MCG and SCG radio resources. However, a high value also delays the use of UE data split on both the MCG and SCG radio resources. A value that is too high can prohibit the UE from splitting uplink data.
- A low value can result in increased and varying latency for shorter user data transmissions.
- A value that is too low can result in a fluctuating downlink and uplink application layer throughput. Therefore, such a value must be avoided.

Primary Path Configuration for Uplink PDCP Aggregation

When uplink PDCP aggregation is used, the switching of the primary uplink path is

controlled according to the switching of uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the

Secondary

Node-terminated

split DRB. This function is enabled

through

the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode

attribute. The primary uplink path switches to the MCG radio resources when the

estimated uplink SCG radio quality is below the value of the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute. The hysteresis for switching the primary uplink path back to the SCG

radio resources is defined by the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst

attribute.

The following EBS counters provide observability for the switching of uplink MCG and

SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB:

- The pmEbsEndcPrimaryCgSwitchUlMcgTrigger$ EBS counter increases when the estimated radio quality of the NR link on SCG is poor.
- The pmEbsEndcPrimaryCgSwitchUlScgTrigger$ EBS counter increases when the estimated radio quality of the NR link on SCG is good.

It is recommended to configure the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute to a value that is high enough to enable switching to the MCG radio

resources before the uplink SCG throughput becomes lower than the required uplink

throughput.

The value of the

UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode

attribute determines whether the MCG or the SCG radio resources of the Secondary

Node-terminated split DRB is used initially for user plane transmission in

uplink.

It is recommended to set these attributes to select the cell group with the following

characteristics:

- Shortest average latency
- Average uplink throughput that is high enough for both the uplink and downlink traffic

Optimization of Cell Group Utilization

If the traffic load increases, the scheduling delay can increase differently on the

MCG and the SCG. This increases

the

time difference between packets received from the MCG and SCG

radio resources. This can decrease performance. There are different alternatives to

improve the performance of the LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation feature in these scenarios,

such as:

- Lowering the impact of increased delay in uplink PDCP reordering when traffic load is high by following the guidelines in Configuration of Uplink PDCP Reordering for LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation.
- Lowering the delay in uplink PDCP reordering when the traffic load on the SCG is high by substantially increasing the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute, or by setting it to -1, or by deactivating uplink PDCP aggregation to avoid uplink data splitting on the MCG and the SCG when the primary uplink path is the SCG.
- Lowering the uplink PDCP reordering delay when the traffic load on the EN-DC MCG is high by substantially increasing the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute, or by setting it to -1, or by deactivating uplink PDCP aggregation to avoid uplink data splitting on the MCG and the SCG when the primary uplink path is the MCG for ENDC UEs.
- Offloading the SCG when the traffic load on the SCG is high by performing one or more of the following steps: Decreasing the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute to increase uplink data splitting on the MCG when the primary uplink path is the SCG. Substantially increasing the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute, or by setting it to -1, or by deactivating uplink PDCP aggregation to avoid data splitting on the SCG for EN-DC UEs when the primary uplink path is the MCG. Increasing the value of the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute to use the MCG more as the primary uplink path.
- Offloading the MCG when the traffic load on the MCG is high by performing one or more of the following steps: Decreasing the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute to increase uplink data splitting on the SCG for EN-DC UEs when the primary uplink path is the MCG. Substantially increasing the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg, or by deactivating uplink PDCP aggregation to avoid data splitting on the MCG when the primary uplink path is the SCG. Decreasing the value of the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute to use the SCG more as the primary uplink path.

## 9.2 Configuration of Uplink PDCP Reordering for LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

Uplink PDCP aggregation affects uplink PDCP reordering. By monitoring the relevant PM

counters, uplink PDCP reordering configuration can be optimized.

Uplink PDCP aggregation is expected to increase the amount of uplink PDCP reordering

because packets are transferred on both the MCG and the SCG radio resources. This has

the following consequences:

- Packets are more likely to be received out of order with a higher relative latency.
- The latency distribution of both the MCG and the SCG radio resources affects the reordering.

Uplink PDCP reordering is configured

through

the following attributes:

- AqmCfg.tOooUlDelivery It is recommended to set this attribute to a higher value if the uplink throughput on the MCG or SCG radio resources, or on both is expected to be very low.
- CUCP5qi.tReorderingUl
- CUCP5qi.tPdcpDiscard

The

configuration of uplink PDCP reordering can be optimized by observing

the following PM counters:

- pmPdcpPktLossUlToQos
- pmPdcpPktLossUlToDiscQos
- pmPdcpPktRecUlOooQos

Table 5 describes the actions that can be

performed depending on the value of the relevant counters.

Table 5   Optimization of Uplink PDCP Reordering

## 9.3 Configure Coverage-Controlled Uplink PDCP Aggregation for EN-DC

Different

thresholds

for uplink data split can be configured for each primary data

path.

Steps

1. Configure the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg and the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attributes to different values.
2. Perform one of the following steps for the threshold specified in the UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute to take effect:
    - Set the value of the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode attribute to ENABLED.
    - Set the value of the UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute to 0.

## 9.4 Deprecation Handling Related to Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile

The

differentiated configuration thresholds for uplink cell group switching can be configured

with the backward compatible attributes.

The Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature introduces differentiated

configuration thresholds for uplink cell group switching for EN-DC and NR-DC. This

feature introduces and deprecates attributes, which

affect

the LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature.

For more information, see Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile.

The following backward compatible attributes are introduced to replace the deprecated

attributes:

- The UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ulPdcpScgRetProhibitTime attribute replaces the GNBCUUPFunction.endcUlNrRetProhibTimer attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.initialUplinkConf attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThreshold attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThresholdMcg attribute.

The following attributes control deprecation handling:

- GNBCUCPFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled
- GNBCUUPFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled

The default value of these attributes is true, which means that

deprecation handling is enabled by default to support the automatic migration of the

attributes.

# 10 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 10.1 21.Q4: Coverage-Controlled Uplink EN-DC Aggregation

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to disable uplink PDCP

aggregation for EN-DC when the primary uplink path is the MCG radio resources.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5091                |
| Value Package Name:     | Peak Rate Evolution         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4005                |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node         |
| Access Type:            | NR                          |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables the configuration of different uplink data split

thresholds depending on the primary uplink path. This way, uplink EN-DC aggregation

can be disabled when the primary uplink path is the MCG radio resources. This means

that the UE does not send any uplink PDCP data on SCG radio resources if the quality

of those resources is poor. Coverage-controlled uplink PDCP aggregation for EN-DC

can reduce the risk of uplink SCG RLF.

Capacity and Performance

Several NR and LTE KPIs are affected by coverage-controlled uplink EN-DC

aggregation.
