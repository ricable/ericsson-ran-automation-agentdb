Summary

The feature increases uplink cell throughput, as multiple devices can be coscheduled

on the same PUSCH time and frequency resources. The increase is proportional to the

number of coscheduled users. Uplink spectrum efficiency and average cell throughput

are also increased by coscheduling multiple users on the same resources.

The feature offers the following functionalities and benefits:

- User-specific beamforming
- CP-OFDM and DFTS-OFDM waveform support
- Suppressed inter- and intra-cell interference
- Increased average and peak uplink cell throughput
- Increased uplink spectrum efficiency

The

Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature enables scheduling over multiple layers in the following

ways:

- In the same set of PRBs
- In the entire frequency band
- In parts of the frequency band, and over less number of layers in other parts of the frequency band

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to this feature:

- One uplink layer is enabled for each UE.
- The same PRBs are assigned to coscheduled users.
- Up to four devices can be coscheduled on the same time and frequency resources.
- For the feature to operate, the NRCellDU.ulMaxMuMimoLayers attribute must be set to a value greater than 0.

Network Requirements

This feature does not have specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

The feature enhances data transmission in the uplink by spatial

multiplexing.

The

Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature enables uplink spatial

multiplexing.

In this way, extra PRBs are deployed in the entire network. Uplink spectrum efficiency

is increased, hence uplink cell throughput is also increased. One UE can be scheduled

over each layer, while transmission is allowed over up to four layers.

AAS radio allows the feature to suppress strong interference between coscheduled devices

which use the same time and frequency resources. The feature suppresses inter-cell

interference with the full IRC receiver.

The

Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature also supports the split mode deployment on

AAS radio.

Figure 2   AAS Radio Split Mode

Additionally, the performance of the feature is enhanced by the spatial separation of

devices. This operation is based on UE channel information. A sufficiently low channel

correlation is required for devices to be paired. For this reason, the devices must be

separated in space according to a certain threshold value.

Operational Process

The feature assigns the same uplink resources to coscheduled users. Coscheduling is

based on the following criteria:

- Devices are orthogonal to one another
- UE channel conditions
- UE traffic
- Cell load

Figure 3   Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

Resource

Allocation

The feature enables the following components:

- Single-layer UE scheduling
- The UE receives a unique DMRS sequence

The PUSCH receiver jointly processes all devices allocated in the same

time-frequency resource. User-specific beamforming and the full IRC functionality

ensure that the following events do not occur:

- Interference between devices
- Inter-cell interference

Interference cancellation and decoding is handled in the gNodeB. As a result, no extra signaling is required for the UE.

# 4 Network Impact of Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

The feature increases uplink throughput and capacity by coscheduling up to four UEs

and four PUSCH layers.

Capacity and Performance

The feature supports up to four layers over PUSCH. The layers are coscheduled on the

same time and frequency resources. One UE can be scheduled over one layer only.

The

Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature increases the performance of the following

functions:

- Uplink throughput
- Uplink capacity
- Spatial resource capacity

Each allocation type is enabled over up to four layers. The allocation limit is

determined by the following characteristics:

- The number of scheduling elements in each TTI of each cell
- The processing bandwidth limit of the gNodeB The limit equals four scheduling elements in each TTI of each cell and a specified number of resource blocks.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

AAS.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

Full IRC receiver processing uses improved spatial filtering to enhance the uplink

interference suppression capability for single-user and multi-user MIMO. As a

result, uplink UE throughput is increased.

Capacity and Performance

The increase in uplink UE throughput might also impact cell throughput, which can be

observed through the NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl counter.

The feature enhancement is more efficient if any of the following conditions apply

for the cell:

- Good to medium channel conditions
- Higher demand for multi-user MIMO
- Heavy network load

Minor BLER decrease can be expected due to fewer NACKs in case of 4-layer

transmission.

- Uplink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

This feature enhancement also adds Low-Band support for the following features:

- Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band
- Ericsson Uplink Booster
- Uplink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

Consequently, the

Multi-User

MIMO features are renamed to indicate Low-Band support.
