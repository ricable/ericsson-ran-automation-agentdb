Summary

The NR 8CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature aggregates up to eight contiguous or

non-contiguous component carriers with a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The maximum

aggregated operational bandwidth is 800 MHz. The possible combinations depend on the

radio.

For non-contiguous component carriers, the gaps must be multiples of 50 MHz, while keeping all

aggregated carriers within the operational bandwidth.

The feature allows higher downlink data throughput for a single UE and a more efficient use of

scattered spectrum.

Hardware

- The feature is enabled on High-Band radios capable of 4×10.1 or 2×25 Gbps CPRI.

Limitations

- In one PAAM segment, the same cell must be selected as PSCell for all UEs.
- Only intra-band carrier aggregation is supported.
- AIR 5121 is not supported.

Network Requirements

The UE must support downlink carrier aggregation as specified in 3GPP TS

38.101-4; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception; Part 4:

Performance Requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 8CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature enables higher throughput for dual connectivity-capable devices by

aggregating NR carriers.

Feature Configuration Process

The feature is configured during the initial setup of SCG

radio resources.

All UEs within the same coverage area use the same cell as

PSCell. The cell with the lowest NR-ARFCN that is also uplink-capable is selected as the

PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is used, each sector is

configured with two PSCells.

All SCells are activated when the random access procedure and the P2/Secondary Node

beam refinement are completed. The SCells can be aggregated for increased data

throughput after the reception of the first Power Headroom Report including SCells,

or if downlink data remains in the RLC buffer after scheduling on PSCell. The

required downlink data amount that remains in the RLC buffer is based on

thresholding.

Link adaptation is performed on each carrier. The Scheduler High-Band feature utilizes all

component carriers to maximize throughput in each downlink slot.

The number of aggregated carriers depends on the UE

capability and on the number of Secondary Node-configured cells.

Figure 1   Composition of Component Carriers

SCG Configuration Selection in the Secondary Node

The Secondary Node selects an SCG configuration, supported both by the UE and the NR

cells, that maximizes the aggregated bandwidth.

## 3.1 Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

In contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation, the carriers are located next to one

another within the same band. The carriers are allocated with a defined nominal

channel spacing, which is between their middle frequencies.

Channel spacing can be equal to or less than the nominal value. In such cases, the

Secondary Node considers carriers for contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation.

Figure 2   Example of 8×100 MHz Contiguous Aggregated Carrier Components

Non-Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

In non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the carriers are located within the same band,

with a spectrum of uncoordinated operation between them. This spectrum may be owned

by another operator. The intra-band gap must be a multiple of 50 MHz.

If the channel spacing is larger than the nominal value, the Secondary Node considers

the carriers for non-contiguous carrier aggregation.

of 200 MHz

## 3.2 SCell Configuration and Link Scheduling

SCell Configuration

SCells are configured with blind selection. All configured cells in the Secondary

Node that are not PSCells can be SCell candidates.

An SCell configured for both uplink and downlink traffic is a candidate for uplink

aggregation. A maximum of three SCells can be configured for

uplink and downlink traffic for each sector.

Once an SCell is configured for a UE, the configuration remains until the SCG radio

resources are released.

SCell Activation

Initially only the PSCell is activated. SCells are activated based on the uplink or

downlink throughput need. The uplink or downlink throughput need activates all

SCells to provide throughput according to the following requirements:

- The downlink need is activated if enough data remains in the buffer after a successful PSCell scheduling.
- The uplink need is activated based on the uplink buffer estimate and the UE power headroom.

The number of scheduled SCells determines UE power for each SCell

and the resulting SINR. Therefore, uplink link adaptation needs to consider the

number of scheduled SCells. For more information about

secondary cell activation, see Dynamic Component Carrier Management.

All active SCells are deactivated if the UE reports UAI overheating.

SCell reactivation is not allowed until the overheating condition is mitigated. If

the UAI overheating is mitigated, SCells can be reactivated if the PSCell capacity

is not sufficient to serve the needed downlink or uplink data.

Link Scheduling

Downlink scheduling is performed on all activated PSCell and SCells if the following

requirements are met:

- The reported CQI of these cells is larger than 0.
- There is downlink data in the buffer to transmit.

Uplink scheduling is always performed on the PSCell. If the radio quality and the UE

power headroom for the PSCell are sufficient, uplink scheduling is also performed on

the SCell.

When multiple PSCells are used, not all configured SCells are scheduled for a UE in a

given Transmission Time Interval (TTI) if the following characteristics apply:

- One UE from each PSCell is scheduled in a TTI.
- SCells are shared between UEs.

New data and retransmissions can be sent in parallel, within the same slot, on

different carriers.

If the Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature is not activated, the SCells

remain activated until the SCG radio resources are released.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR 8CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

## 9.1 Configure Transmission Direction and SCell Relation in High-Band

The NRCellRelation and the NRSectorCarrier MO

instances have configurable attributes in high-band that define the following cell

properties:

- SCell relation
- Direction of the transmission

The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is used to define a

cell to be referenced as an SCell.

The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator is used to define the

coverage area relation of all cells in one sector.

The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute must be set to

ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for all cells

that are SCell candidates. The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator

attribute must be set to OVERLAP for each cell in the same

sector.

The NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute is used to define the

direction of the

transmission.

Among the cells configured for uplink and downlink traffic, the cell with the lowest

ARFCN is selected as PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is enabled, also the

cell configured for uplink and downlink traffic with highest ARFCN is selected as

PSCell if they are assigned to different PAAM segments. One SCell

adjacent to the PSCell can be configured for both uplink and downlink traffic which

allows uplink carrier aggregation. The other uplink- and downlink-configured cells

are used for uplink and downlink carrier aggregation. The other SCell or SCells

within the same sector must be configured to have downlink capability only.

Prerequisites

- The NRCellRelation MO Class exists and have a reference to other instances of the NRCellCU MO in the same sector.
- The SectorEquipmentFunction MO Class exists.
- The NRSectorCarrier MO Class exists.
- The NRFreqRelation MO Class exists.
- The NRFrequency MO Class exists.
- The SectorEquipmentFunction MO is configured and available to be associated with the NRSectorCarrier MO.
- The following attributes of the NRSectorCarrier MO are configured with valid values: NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL NRSectorCarrier.arfcnUL NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Configure the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute to set the transmission direction of a sector carrier.
    1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute value on the PSCell candidate sector carriers to DL\_AND\_UL. The PSCell candidate with the lowest ARFCN is selected as PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is enabled, the PSCell candidates with the lowest and highest ARFCN are selected as PSCells if they are assigned to different PAAM segments. The other PSCell candidate sector carriers can be used as SCells for uplink and downlink carrier aggregation.
    2. Set the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute value on the remaining SCell candidate sector carriers to DL. These sector carriers can be used as SCells for downlink carrier aggregation.
3. Verify that the NRCellRelation MO is set up according to the following steps:
    1. Set the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute value to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for SCell candidate sector carriers in a sector. This configuration allows cells in a sector to be SCell candidates.
    2. Set the NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute value to OVERLAP to define cell relations in a given coverage area.
4. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

Results

The cell relation for SCells and the transmission direction for a sector carrier is

configured.

The SCell configured for uplink and downlink traffic allows uplink carrier

aggregation. Other cells with downlink capability only can be selected as the SCells

for downlink carrier aggregation.

Setting new values in the following attribute combinations can interrupt traffic on

all cells using the AIR unit:

- NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL and NRSectorCarrier.arfcnUL
- NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDLand NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL

## 9.2 Configure Antenna Segmentation

This procedure is applicable to Indoor AIR 1279, AIR 1281, AIR 5322, and Streetmacro

6705 units.

Steps

- Configure the preferred antenna segmentation by following the instructions described in the Manage Hardware Equipment document.

## 9.3 Asymmetric Power Configuration in NR High-Band

Asymmetric carrier allocation occurs on radios with multiple PAAM segments in which the

carriers cannot be evenly distributed, for example when the frequency separation of the

carriers is larger than the bandwidth of a PAAM segment.

The asymmetric setting of NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

attribute among carriers is allowed.

The PSCell must be mapped to the carrier with the highest output power:

- The PSCell handles all necessary control procedures and defines the coverage for the UE.
- The PSCell is currently assigned to the NRSectorCarrier MO instance with the lowest or highest ARFCN that has the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute set to DL\_AND\_UL.

SCells can be assigned to carriers with lower output power. The recommended maximum power

difference between the PSCell and any SCell is 6-8 dB.

PSCell and SCells can be in the same or in different PAAM segments.
