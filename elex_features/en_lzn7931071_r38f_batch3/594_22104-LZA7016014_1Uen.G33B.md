# 1 NR Aperiodic CSI Trigger Handling Overview

The feature increases the periodicity of aperiodic CSI based on the downlink

buffer.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature extends aperiodic CSI reporting periodicity for certain users based on downlink

traffic. UEs with low downlink traffic demands are assigned a longer CSI reporting

period. This might improve uplink throughput because more uplink slots are

available.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Aperiodic CSI Trigger Handling

The feature has dependencies to the UE Grouping Framework feature, carrier

aggregation-related features, and the NR Dynamic Power Optimizer feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Aperiodic CSI Trigger Handling

The feature categorizes UEs based on a traffic threshold to use different

periodicities for aperiodic CSI. The CSI report can be immediately triggered again if a CSI

report is invalid.

The feature enables the categorization of users based on the downlink data buffer and

allows the use of different aperiodic CSI reporting periodicities based on these

categories. The feature introduces the

CsiProfileUeCfg.csiBufferThresh attribute, which is used to

distinguish between low- and high-traffic UEs. The validation is performed in every slot

when the CsiProfileUeCfg.csiBufferThresh attribute is set to a value

other than OFF.

UEs are differentiated into the following categories:

| UEs with no data   |    | The UE has no data traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| UEs with low data  |    | If the UE has data traffic that is lower than the threshold set in the                                 CsiProfileUeCfg.csiBufferThresh attribute, the                             CSI period is extended by the value configured in the                                 CsiProfileUeCfg.csiRptPeriodAdd attribute. |
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| UEs with high data |    | The UE has higher data traffic than the threshold set in the                                 CsiProfileUeCfg.csiBufferThresh attribute.                                                                                                                                                                            |

The feature affects UEs that belong to the UEs with low data category.

The UE Grouping Framework feature is used to control the attribute settings of the

feature and observability on a UE group level.

When using carrier aggregation, the aperiodic CSI reports for each cell can be split into

multiple reports. The number of activated cell carriers and SINR thresholds determine

which carriers are included in these reports.

Retriggering an Aperiodic CSI Report

When the aperiodic CSI report is extended for a UE and a CSI report is invalid, the

wait time before the next CSI report is longer.

To avoid this, the CsiProfileUeCfg.csiPollRetransmitEnabled

attribute is introduced to retrigger the CSI report immediately if the previously

scheduled report is not correctly received.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Aperiodic CSI Trigger Handling

The feature might improve uplink UE throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The feature might improve uplink throughput for FDD, through the better utilization

of uplink resources.

The feature might reduce PDCCH blocking for networks with heavy traffic for TDD.

When the feature is in use, a minor increase in the uplink BLER can be seen.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature is not recommended to be used with VoNR UEs, because it might reduce

their performance.

| KPI                          | Description                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Average UL MAC UE Throughput | The KPI might increase as uplink data transmission increases                                     because of improved slot utilization. |

Table 4   Resource Indicators

| RI                     | Description                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| PUSCH Slot Utilization | The RI might increase because of improved slot utilization. |

Counters

The feature might improve slot utilization, which can be observed through the

following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmPuschSchedActivity
- NRCellDU.pmPuschAvailTime

The feature might improve uplink throughput, which can be observed through the

following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeUlResUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmPuschSchedActivity
- NRCellDU.pmPuschAvailTime

A reduced number of downlink radio resource switches might be observed through the

following PM counters because of the longer CSI period:

- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlMcg
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlScg

The decrease in the sleep time of the Connected Mode DRX feature can be observed

through the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmDrxSleepTime
- NRCellDU.pmDrxTotalTime

Events

This feature has no associated events.
