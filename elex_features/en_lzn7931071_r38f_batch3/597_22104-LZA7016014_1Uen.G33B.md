external

synchronization references are available.

Summary

The feature enables the node to operate within an isolated TDD-unicast area, which allows the

node to carry traffic in isolated areas, such as underground garages, where no

external

synchronization references are available. The feature can also be

used in

special

cases,

such as System-on-Wheels standalone radio systems, and emergency

cases.

Hardware

The feature is supported on the following hardware units:

- RAN Compute units, except for Streetmacro 6705
- Remote radio units with external antenna
- Massive MIMO TDD FR2 CPRI radio units
- eCPRI radio units

Limitations

The feature only supports single-node and single-standard configuration.

Network Requirements

No impact.

# 3 Feature Operation of Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source

The feature allows a node to start and carry traffic when no external synchronization

references are available.

After the feature is activated and the node is restarted with rank COLD, the node enters

isolated mode and starts to operate in

an

isolated TDD-unicast area. Therefore, the node cannot hand over any calls to a

neighboring node and the call drops when the UE moves outside of the cell coverage.

Figure 2   Single eNodeB Deployed without Synchronization Reference

Figure 3   Single gNodeB Deployed without Synchronization Reference

The feature requires the following connections:

- Connection with backhaul
- Connection with NTP server

In

isolated mode, the

backhaul

provides the only available synchronization reference, and the NTP server provides the

ToD for License Manager.

If the feature is activated

and

any of the following conditions are fulfilled, alarms might be

triggered because of missing references:

- Any conflicting features are installed and activated.
- The TimeSyncIO MO class is created and can be used for synchronization.

# 4 Network Impact of Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source

The feature has no impact on capacity and performance, interfaces, or other network

elements.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source

The feature has no associated parameters.

There are no introduced, affecting, or affected parameters associated with this

feature.

# 6 Performance of Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source

The feature has no related KPIs, counters, or events.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The conflicting features listed in Dependencies of Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source are deactivated or not installed on the node.
- The TimeSyncIO MO class is not created.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012818 MO instance.
2. Restart the node with RestartRank set to RESTART\_COLD.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012818 MO instance.
2. Restart the node with RestartRank set to RESTART\_COLD.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
