Summary

The feature allows downlink carrier aggregation with five component carriers in

Low-Band and Mid-Band among up to three Advanced RAN Coordination partners. The

Advanced RAN Coordination partners (gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules) are connected by

an E5 link through the Advanced RAN Coordination feature.

The feature creates a more organized MOM structure for carrier aggregation attributes

used by other carrier aggregation features.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Increased downlink peak throughput
- More efficient use of scattered spectrum

# 2 Dependencies of NR 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature uses the Advanced RAN Coordination feature for carrier aggregation

between gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules. The performance is limited by UE capabilities and

cell configurations.

Hardware

RAN Compute groups 4 and higher can be used as both PCell and SCell.

Limitations

- For FDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 900 μs.
- For TDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 350 μs.
- Only NR standalone deployment is supported.
- For TDD-TDD carrier aggregation, the PCell and SCell must have the same TDD patterns.
- The feature is not supported where the PCell has 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured and the SCells have more than 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured.
- UE throughput might decrease in sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three or more component carriers due to reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH. This is also valid when some or all the component carriers are external.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

## 2.1 Downlink Carrier Aggregation Features in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The NR downlink carrier aggregation features in Low-Band and Mid-Band use the same

SCell selection algorithm.

If a carrier aggregation feature with a higher number of component carriers is enabled,

the carrier aggregation features with a lower number of component carriers are also

enabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature allows the aggregation of five component carriers among up to three

gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules. The Advanced RAN Coordination feature provides the E5 link

connectivity between the gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules.

The UE connects to the PCell at the gNodeB, which triggers the execution of the SCell

selection functionality. If possible, the carrier aggregation-capable UE is configured

with four downlink SCells. The selected SCells are configured and activated. For more

information, see NR DL Carrier Aggregation feature.

The following duplex mode combinations are available:

- 3 TDD + 2 FDD
- 2 TDD + 3 FDD
- 1 TDD + 4 FDD

Table 3   Supported Duplex Mode Combinations

| PCell   |   Number of TDD SCells |   Number of FDD SCells |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| TDD     |                      2 |                      2 |
| TDD     |                      1 |                      3 |
| TDD     |                      0 |                      4 |
| FDD     |                      3 |                      1 |
| FDD     |                      2 |                      2 |
| FDD     |                      1 |                      3 |

All configurations of capacity modules and gNodeBs are possible for the supported duplex

mode combinations. However, the following restrictions apply:

- Carriers in the same capacity module must have the same duplex mode.
- Only one capacity module can use FDD duplex mode at a time in a gNodeB. Configuring two capacity modules that use FDD duplex mode in one gNodeB is not possible.

Figure 2   Configuration Example with Three Capacity Modules in Two gNodeBs

# 4 Network Impact of NR 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves cell utilization and increases UE downlink

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cell utilization is expected to improve because downlink data transmission is

distributed across multiple component carriers. UE downlink throughput is increased

by aggregating five component carriers.

In sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three

or more component carriers (some or all external), UE throughput might decrease by

reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following interfaces to ensure that multiple SCells can be

configured at the same time:

- Uu interface The size of the RRC RRCReconfiguration message increases.
- F1 interface The size of the UE Context Modification message increases.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature does not introduce any MO classes or attributes related to the NR 5CC DL

Carrier Aggregation feature. However, the feature creates a more organized MOM structure for

carrier aggregation attributes used by other carrier aggregation features.

| UL CA Partition Utilization | When carrier aggregation partition is configured, the feature impacts the                 uplink carrier aggregation SCell partition utilization, which is monitored by this                 RI. The partition utilization is based on the number of PUSCH resource block symbols                 of carrier aggregation SCell partition and the total number of resource block                 symbols available for uplink transmission in one second. |

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q3.0: Additional Duplex Mode Combinations for NR 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation with Two TDD Cells and Three FDD Cells (Corrected in 24.Q4.0)

The feature enhancement introduces additional configurations for the NR 5CC DL

Carrier Aggregation feature.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces support for two TDD and three FDD carriers across

up to three capacity modules in NR standalone deployments.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Increased flexibility of NR RAN deployment
- Increased flexibility when using the available spectrum
- Increased usability of a scattered spectrum

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

To balance the distribution of PUCCH resources among carrier aggregation capable UEs

and other local UEs, a design change is introduced for scenarios where SpCell is in

TDD mid-band with a large number of active carrier aggregation capable UEs. As a

result, the values reported by the

NRCellDU.pmMacPdcchBlockingPdschOccasions PM counter could be

increased. This increase in the PM counter does not impact the general performance

of the system.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements
