Summary

The Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO feature divides the hardware resources of a

split-mode-capable TDD Massive MIMO radio. The hardware resources, including antenna

branches, are divided between two NR Baseband units, two LTE Baseband units, one NR

Baseband unit and one LTE Baseband unit, or one NR and LTE dual band Baseband

unit.

In this configuration, the Massive MIMO

radio is connected to two Baseband units

that belong to different Managed Elements. The resources are divided over both

contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum.

The Managed Elements can be managed by different operators in a Multi-Operator RAN

configuration.

The hardware resources can also be divided within a single NR Baseband configuration

for AIR 6488 units.

The feature has

the following benefits:

- The virtual IBW of a 2Ã—32TR configuration is increased to 200 MHz, from 100 MHz for a 64TR configuration.
- The channel bandwidth and the number of supported sector carriers are increased.
- The cost efficiency of radio coverage solutions is increased.

Hardware

Only split-mode-capable TDD Massive MIMO radio units are supported.

For the supported configurations, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The frequency, bandwidth and output power configuration for the carriers on the same

split segment must be consistent.

To ensure radio nodes are synchronized, there are the following available

synchronization options:

- GNSS to both nodes
- PTP from backhaul to both nodes
- PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit

# 3 Feature Operation of Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

Split-mode-capable TDD Massive MIMO radios support Split Mode Radio for LTE + LTE, LTE + NR,

and NR + NR, and NR Mixed Mode Radio.

AIR 6488 is an example of a TDD-enabled Massive MIMO and split-mode-capable radio that supports

this feature.

Figure 1   Combinations of Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO in AIR 6488

eCPRI Links to Baseband Units

- For LTE + NR, the Baseband unit with LTE traffic is connected with two eCPRI links. The Baseband unit with NR traffic is connected with one eCPRI link.
- For LTE + LTE or NR + NR, the Baseband unit with the higher load is connected with two eCPRI links. The other Baseband unit is connected with one eCPRI link.

Split Mode Selection

The AasData.antSegmentation attribute is

applied to configure split-mode or mixed-mode radio configuration, with the following

values:

- If the attribute is set to WHOLE\_100 on both radio nodes, mixed mode radio configuration is applied.
- If the attribute is set to AUTO\_SPLIT on both radio nodes, split mode radio configuration is applied.
- If the attribute is set to AUTO on either of the radio nodes and the AAS hardware resources can handle the carrier demands, mixed mode radio is selected. Otherwise, split mode radio is selected.

Related concepts

Engineering Guidelines for Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

## 3.1 Split Mode Cell Shapes

Vertical split, horizontal split, or no split (single carrier) is automatically selected

based on the cell shapes of the carriers:

- MACRO: Vertical split of antenna
- HOTSPOT: Horizontal split of antenna
- HIGHRISE: Vertical split of antenna

Figure 2   Antenna Splits

If all carriers are set to identical cell shapes, that shape is used for the split.

(MACRO and HIGHRISE both result in vertical

split.)

If carriers are set to different cell shapes, the antenna defaults to the split of most

carriers. If the number of carriers with each cell shape configuration is equal, the

MACRO and HIGHRISE cell shapes have a higher

priority than HOTSPOT, and vertical split is used.

## 3.2 eCPRI Mixed Mode Synchronization

The eCPRI Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO feature shares radio resources between two

nodes, which requires that the nodes are synchronized.

For shared eCPRI radios, such as AIR 6488, the phase synchronization between the nodes is

assured by time and phase synchronizing both nodes. Time and phase synchronization are

described in Manage Network Synchronization.

The eCPRI Mixed Mode Radio feature supports the following methods:

- GNSS to both nodes
- PTP from backhaul to both nodes
- PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit

The PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit method has better robustness at

GNSS or backhaul PTP synchronization faults than the other methods.

For more details regarding each synchronization method, see Synchronization in

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

In some cases, an extra radio restart might be needed to allocate

resources.

When switching to split mode, after a manual restart, or after a software update,

configuration information is checked from both nodes that share the Massive MIMO radio

unit.

It is possible that configuration information from one of the nodes is not immediately

available. In this case, the system waits 30 seconds for the second node to provide the

missing information. If the second node becomes available before the timer expires, both

nodes are configured to use the shared Massive MIMO radio unit. Otherwise, only the

first node is configured.

If the second node only becomes available after the timer expires, then an additional

radio restart might be needed to reallocate resources.

Feature Operation of Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

## 9.1 Reconfigure Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

When the radio networks used together with split mode are reconfigured, sector

carriers and cells must locked. When this includes switching from split mode to non-split

mode, a manual restart is necessary.

Steps

1. Lock all sector carriers and cells on the radio on both Radio Networks that share the radio.
2. Reconfigure one or both Radio Networks. Note: A manual radio restart is required when switching from split mode to non-split mode.
3. Unlock the sector carriers and cells on both Radio Networks.

Results

The new settings take effect after the sector carriers and cells are unlocked. In

case one of the DUs start late after the unlock, the radio might restart one

additional time to reallocate resources.

Benefits

The enhancement increases the number of supported synchronization solutions by

supporting time alignment. This time alignment uses PTP from a common router that is

directly connected to the Baseband units. The router can take time from a GNSS or

from backhaul using PTP.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

To support the stable operation of the Split Mode Radio, the two Baseband units have

to be synchronized. The PTP time distributed from a switch with integrated Telecom

Boundary Clock support ensures that both Baseband units connected to the same switch

have sufficient accuracy to support the Split Mode Radio.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.d: 22.Q1: Improved Sync Solution for Mixed/Split Mode Radio on AAS

The enhancement introduces fronthaul time reference to enable better time alignment

between two Baseband units sharing the same radio.

Summary and Benefits

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- Better alignment compared to usage of PTP and GNSS receiver on each Baseband separately. Restart or reference loss on one Baseband unit does not affect the other Baseband unit.
- Redundancy by having the possibility to switch synchronization from one Baseband to other in case of reference failure. When the Baseband unit that provides synchronization has problems with its time reference, the other Baseband unit can use its own reference to provide stable synchronization until the original reference is recovered.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This enhancement introduces the

RadioEquipmentClock.fronthaulReferenceTable attribute and the

following MOs:

- FronthaulReference
- FronthaulPtpBcOcPort
- FronthaulBoundaryOrdinaryClock

To configure the time reference introduced by this enhancement, the following actions

are required:

- Each Baseband unit needs to have the following MOs configured: FronthaulBoundaryOrdinaryClock FronthaulPtpBcOcPort FronthaulReference
- For every RiPort MO that leads to the shared radio, the FronthaulPtpBcOcPort MO must be created with the FronthaulPtpBcOcPort.transportInterface attribute pointing to the same RiPort MO.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement is applicable to split-mode-capable or mixed-mode-capable TDD AAS

radio units.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 21.3 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
