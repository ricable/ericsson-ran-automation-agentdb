# 1 NR Flexible Cell Shaping High-Band Overview

The feature enables the configuration of sector shape and digital tilt.

Summary

The feature introduces flexible cell shaping, which means it is possible to choose

between different coverage shapes, allowing the service area to be configured in a

more flexible way. For coverage shapes where the elevation coverage is less than the

maximum elevation coverage of the radio, the digital tilt function can move the

service area in elevation by changing the value of the

CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt attribute.

Using one of the macro shapes introduces a trade-off of service area reduction in

elevation.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Flexible Cell Shaping High-Band

The feature has hardware dependencies, and

it is supported for

EN-DC- and NR-DC-configured UEs.

Feature Dependencies

| Feature                          | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fronthaul Sharing (FAJ 121 5213) | Related        | The NR Flexible Cell Shaping High-Band feature is supported in                                     fronthaul sharing deployments. |

Hardware

The feature is supported on the following hardware units:

- AIR 1281
- AIR 5322
- AIR 5343
- Streetmacro 6701
- Streetmacro 6705

The feature is supported in the following fronthaul sharing deployments:

- Fronthaul sharing with two or three AIR 1281 units
- Fronthaul sharing with two or three AIR 5322 units

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Flexible Cell Shaping High-Band

With this feature, non-default sector shapes can be manually selected, and the

service area can be moved by tilting the shape in

elevation.

The sector shape can be configured with the following attributes:

- CommonBeamforming.coverageShape
- CommonBeamforming.ssbBeams
- CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt

The following rules must apply to the configuration:

- All sector carriers in one sector must have the same sector shape, the same SSB beams value, and the same tilt value.
- Different sectors can be configured with different sector shapes, but the sector shapes must have the same number of SSB beams.

Inconsistent configurations of the CommonBeamforming.coverageShape,

CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt

attributes or the attribute combination raise the MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment

alarm. If the alarm is raised, the sector carrier runs in degraded state with the

default settings. The coverage shape and digital tilt that the system uses are indicated

by the following attributes:

- CommonBeamforming.usedCoverageShape
- CommonBeamforming.usedDigitalTilt

No alarm is raised if the sector shapes have different number of SSB beams indicated in

the value of the CommonBeamforming.ssbBeams attribute. However, the

wrong configuration of SSB beams might result in downlink throughput degradation for the

configured sectors.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Flexible Cell Shaping High-Band

The feature affects initial access coverage, access latency, cell throughput, and

service area.

Capacity and Performance

Macro shapes have a reduced service area in elevation (±7.5 degrees or ±10 degrees)

compared to hotspot shapes (±15 degrees).

The downlink throughput for a carrier with 12 wide beams is higher

than

for a carrier with 24 wide beams because of the lower downlink

overhead.

Macro3 has a wide beam gain increase of 2.5 dB compared to the default shape Hotspot2

when it is used on the following hardware units:

- AIR 1281
- AIR 5322
- Streetmacro 6705

For AIR 5343, the wide beam peak EIRP of the MACRO\_120\_20 coverage shape changes

compared to the default coverage shape in the following configuration modes:

- Increased by 2 dB in configuration mode 2
- Decreased by &lt;1 dB in configuration mode 1

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Summary and Benefits

Flexible cell shaping enables users to select between different coverage shapes. The

new coverage shapes allow the service area to be configured in a more flexible way.

For coverage shapes where the elevation coverage is less than the maximum elevation

coverage of the radio, the tilt function can move the service area in elevation.

Using one of the macro shapes introduces a

service area

reduction trade-off in elevation.

Capacity and Performance

The macro shapes have a reduced service area in elevation

with

15 degrees compared to existing hotspot shapes

with

30 degrees.

The downlink throughput for a carrier with 12 wide beams is higher than a carrier

with 24 wide beams because of the lower downlink overhead. Compared to default

coverage shapes, this enhancement improves the downlink throughput for the shape

Macro5

and the following shapes when they are used in fronthaul sharing deployments:

- Macro1
- Macro3
- Macro4

When the shape

Macro3

is used by AIR 1281 in

configuration mode

2 or Streetmacro 6701

in configuration mode

2, it has a wide beam gain of 2.5 dB and improves the initial

access coverage compared to the default shape

Hotspot2.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following enumeration values to the

CommonBeamforming.ssbBeams attribute and the

CommonBeamforming.usedSsbBeams attribute:

- SSB\_BEAMS\_4
- SSB\_BEAMS\_6
- SSB\_BEAMS\_8

The tilt function moves the service area in elevation by changing the value of the

CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt attribute.

The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed

Equipment alarm is raised with

different

additional texts when configurations of the following attributes and their

combinations are inconsistent with the installed radio equipment:

- CommonBeamforming.coverageShape
- CommonBeamforming.ssbBeams
- CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt

## 10.2 23.Q1: New Macro Coverage Shape and Tilt Streetmacro 6705

This feature enhancement introduces macro coverage shape and tilt function for

Streetmacro 6705.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                             |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces the tilt function to Streetmacro 6705, which is

already supported on AIR 1281, AIR 5322, and Streetmacro 6701. One additional macro

coverage shape is also introduced for Streetmacro 6705.

The tilt function can move the service area in elevation for all existing and new

macro shapes for Streetmacro 6705. Using one of the macro shapes introduces a

service area reduction trade-off in elevation.

Capacity and Performance

In configuration mode 2, Streetmacro 6705 now also supports Macro5 shape that has a

reduced service area in elevation, 15 degrees compared to 30 degrees for existing

default hotspot shape.

The downlink throughput for a carrier with 12 wide beams is higher than a carrier

with 24 wide beams because of the lower downlink overhead. Compared to default

coverage shape, the downlink throughput is improved for the Macro5 shape.

## 10.4 24.Q1.0: Macro Coverage Shapes and Tilt for AIR 5343

The feature enhancement introduces macro coverage shapes and the tilt function for

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                             |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables flexible cell shaping and the tilt function on AIR

5343. Flexible cell shaping allows users to select between different coverage

shapes. The new coverage shapes allow the service area to be configured in a more

flexible way. For coverage shapes where the elevation coverage is less than the

maximum elevation coverage of the radio, the tilt function can move the service area

in elevation.

Using the macro coverage shapes introduced in this feature enhancement reduces the

service area in elevation.

Consistency checks on the CommonBeamforming MO between and within

NR sector carriers are also supported to detect inconsistencies with beamforming

parameters in multi-carrier configurations.

Capacity and Performance

Macro coverage shapes offer the following characteristics compared to the

HOTSPOT\_120\_30 default coverage shape:

- Reduced service area in elevation by 10 or 15 degrees respectively for the MACRO\_120\_20 and MACRO\_120\_15 coverage shapes
- Improved downlink throughput for all configurations except for the MACRO\_120\_20 coverage shape in configuration mode 2
- Reduced wide beam peak EIRP by less than 1 dB for the MACRO\_120\_20 coverage shape in configuration mode 1
- Increased wide beam peak EIRP by 2 dB for the MACRO\_120\_20 coverage shape in configuration mode 2

Operation

The MACRO\_120\_15 and MACRO\_120\_20 coverage shapes are available and tilt

functionality is supported on AIR 5343.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement supports only AIR 5343.
