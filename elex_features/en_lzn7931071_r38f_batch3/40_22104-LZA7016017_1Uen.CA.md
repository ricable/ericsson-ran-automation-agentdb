Summary

The RAN Slicing Framework feature allows for the use of network slicing. The setup of the

S-NSSAI list makes the exchange of the supported slice lists possible between the

following elements:

- gNodeB
- Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
- Neighbor gNodeB

The feature also enables the S-NSSAI in PDU sessions and for slice-aware AMF selection.

The following functions are supported without activating the RAN Slicing Framework feature:

- Slicing framework for S-NSSAI configuration and handling
- Slice-aware AMF selection

The following functions are supported if the RAN Slicing Framework feature is active:

- Slice-aware QoS mapping framework
- Slice-aware handover

Hardware

The RAN Slicing Framework feature is enabled on all Baseband units supporting NR.

Network Requirements

There are no network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of RAN Slicing Framework

The RAN Slicing Framework feature adds new configurations to the S-NSSAI list and

supports slice-aware Core Network instance selection. Additionally, the feature enables the

slice-aware QoS mapping framework and facilitates slice-aware handover with the RAN Slicing

Framework license.

## 3.1 Slicing Framework for S-NSSAI Configuration and Handling

The feature supports S-NSSAI configuration and handling to select and handle a

network slice.

S-NSSAI configuration and handling is supported in the following interfaces:

- RRC
- E1
- F1
- Xn
- NG

The S-NSSAI consists of the following elements:

| Slice Service Type (SST)   |    | The SST identifies a type of network slice with specific capabilities and                             characteristics to fulfill the business requirement of services using                             that slice.   |
|----------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Slice Differentiator (SD)  |    | The SD is an optional part that is used to identify different network                             slices belonging to the same service type.                                                                          |

Figure 1   Format of the S-NSSAI

### 3.1.1 S-NSSAI Configuration

The configuration of an S-NSSAI list is supported through the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.sNSSAIListNote: The value of the NRCellDU.sNSSAIList attribute can be changed without locking and unlocking the cell. The changes in the S-NSSAI list for the cell take effect for newly connected UEs in the cell.
- GNBCUUPFunction.sNSSAIList
- When the Xn interface is not available, the ExternalNRCellCU.sNSSAIList attribute is also supported.

Based on the configured S-NSSAI list, the NRCellCU.sNSSAIList

attribute is configured with the supported S-NSSAI list within the gNodeB.

The supported S-NSSAI list is exchanged between the gNodeB and the Access and Mobility

Management Function (AMF) through the NG interface. The

TermPointToAmf.sNSSAIList attribute is configured with the

S-NSSAI list received from the AMF.

The supported S-NSSAI list is exchanged between neighbor gNodeBs through the Xn

interface. The ExternalNRCellCU.sNSSAIList attribute is configured

with the S-NSSAI list received from the neighbor gNodeB.

### 3.1.2 S-NSSAI Handling

The feature supports S-NSSAI handling in PDU sessions using the following procedures:

- Initial Context Setup
- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify
- NG Handover Resource Allocation
- Xn Handover Preparation
- S-NG-RAN Node Addition Preparation

## 3.2 Slice-Aware AMF Selection

The feature supports the AMF selection based on 5G-S-TMSI, Registered AMF or Requested

NSSAI provided by the UE through the RRCSetupComplete message during

registration procedure.

When a UE registers to the 5GC, it provides either 5G-S-TMSI, Registered AMF, or

Requested NSSAI information to the gNodeB in the

RRCSetupComplete message. The gNodeB selects

the AMF using this information in following order:

1. The 5G-S-TMSI is always preferred, if present.
2. If a 5G-S-TMSI is not present, a Registered AMF is preferred. Note: If the UE indicates that the GUAMI type is mapped, the gNodeB selects an AMF regardless of the information provided by the UE about the registered AMFs. If an AMF pointed to 5G-S-TMSI or RegisteredAMF is considered unavailable because its all associated GUAMI(s) are set to unavailable by the AMF STATUS INDICATION message, the gNodeB selects another available AMF. For more information about the AMF Status Indication procedure, see 3GPP TS 38.413 NG-RAN; NG Application Protocol (NGAP) .
3. If neither of the above are present, s-NSSAI-List is selected.

If none of this information is provided by the UE, the gNodeB selects one from the default AMFs that are configured on the node and supports the

PLMN of the UE.

If several AMFs in the PLMN of the UE are candidates for selection, the gNodeB selects the AMF among candidate AMFs based on AMF

relative capacity information contained in the

TermPointToAmf.relativeCapacity MO.

If AMF reselection is performed in the 5GC, the NAS message is transferred from the gNodeB to the initial AMF through the initial UE message and it

is directly rerouted to the target AMF. The target AMF sends the initial context setup

request message instead of the initial AMF. This case is supported by the gNodeB.

Figure 2   AMF Selection

If the gNodeB loses connection to all default AMFs, the Default

AMF PLMN Service Unavailable alarm is raised with the additional text indicating the

cause of the failure.

For more

information,

see Default AMF PLMN Service Unavailable.

## 3.3 Slice-Aware Quality of Service Mapping Framework

The gNodeB can provide differentiated QoS parameters for each

network slice. In such cases, the RAN Slicing Framework feature supports the slice-aware

QoS mapping framework. The gNodeB supports the mapping of

slice-specific QoS characteristics, using the slice QoS mapping table when the RAN

Slicing Framework license is operable.

If the EN-DC RAN Slicing feature is enabled, the feature extends

the QoS mapping framework for EN-DC traffic.

Slice-aware QoS mapping can also be performed in the Secondary Node

for NR-DC UEs. In this case, the S-NSSAI received from the Primary Node through the XnAP

interface is used.

## 3.4 Slice-Aware Handover

The RAN Slicing Framework feature enables slice-aware handover. The gNodeB uses the supported S-NSSAI list of neighbor gNodeBs received through the Xn interface during inter-gNodeB

handover evaluation. In this way, the gNodeB can avoid the

unnecessarily triggering of the handover process.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for RAN Slicing Framework

The RAN Slicing Framework feature enables the configuration of the S-NSSAI list and

default AMF.

For more information see NR SA Network Slicing Guideline.

## 9.1 Enable RAN Slicing

### 9.1.1 Enable Basic RAN Slicing

Basic RAN slicing with slice configuration is enabled if the RAN Slicing Framework

feature is not active. The following functions are not supported in this case:

- Slice-aware handover
- Slice-aware QoS framework

Steps

1. Ensure that the NRCellDU.sNSSAIList and GNBCUUPFunction.sNSSAIList attributes are configured. The NRCellDU.sNSSAIList attribute must be configured with the S-NSSAI of the network slices provided in the corresponding tracking area. Note: If the NRCellDU.sNSSAIList attribute is not configured by the operator, the S-NSSAI is defined by the following default slice service type and slice differentiator values: SST=1 for the slice service type SD=0xFFFFFF (=16777215) for the slice differentiator For the slice differentiator field, 0xFFFFFF is a reserved value which indicates that no slice differentiator value is associated with the slice service type. In this case, only the slice service type field value is included in the NGAP RAN Configuration Update message that transfers the S-NSSAI information to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and the neighbor gNodeB. The GNBCUUPFunction.sNSSAIList attribute is recommended to be configured with the S-NSSAI from all NRCellDU MOs on the gNodeB. If the GNBCUUPFunction.sNSSAIList attribute is not configured by the operator, the CU-UP function does not perform a slice-related check for bearer setup for the PDU sessions of the network slice.
2. Ensure that all NRCellDU MOs that have the same TAC and PLMN also have the same sNSSAIList configuration.
3. Ensure that the intersection S-NSSAI between the TermPointToAmf and the NRCellCU MOs are transferred to the neighbor gNodeB through the Xn interface.
4. Ensure that at least one AMF for each PLMN is configured as default in the gNodeB. The value of the TermPointToAmf.defaultAmf attributes that support each PLMN must be set to true.

### 9.1.2 Enable Full RAN Slicing

Full RAN slicing including slice-aware handover and slice-aware QoS framework is

enabled with slice configuration, and activation of the RAN Slicing Framework

license.

Steps

1. Ensure that the NRCellDU.sNSSAIList and GNBCUUPFunction.sNSSAIList attributes are configured. The NRCellDU.sNSSAIList attribute should be configured with the S-NSSAI of the network slices provided in the corresponding tracking area. The GNBCUUPFunction.sNSSAIList attribute should be configured with the S-NSSAI from all NRCellDU MOs on the gNodeB.
2. Ensure that all NRCellDU MOs that have the same TAC and PLMN also have the same sNSSAIList configuration.
3. Ensure that the intersection S-NSSAI between the TermPointToAmf and NRCellCU MOs are transferred to neighbor gNodeB through the Xn interface.
4. Ensure that the RAN Slicing Framework license is active. Note: If the RAN Slicing Framework license is active, slice-aware handover is enabled and the source gNodeB validates the following attribute during outgoing handover to check if the S-NSSAI of the UE are supported by the candidate target cell: NRCellCU.sNSSAIList in case of intra-gNodeB handover ExternalNRCellCU.sNSSAIList in case of inter-gNodeB handover
5. Ensure that at least one AMF for each PLMN is configured as default in the gNodeB. The TermPointToAmf.defaultAmf attribute supporting each PLMN must be set to true.

changing the S-NSSAI in NR standalone deployments. The change of S-NSSAI takes

effect for newly connected UEs in the cell.

This feature enhancement has the benefit of allowing operators to change the S-NSSAI

without traffic loss.

Capacity and Performance

No traffic loss or service outage is expected in the cell when changing the

S-NSSAI.
