# 1 DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink Overview

The feature enables DFT-s-OFDM waveform in uplink transmissions. The DFT-s-OFDM

waveform reduces the PAPR for the transmitted signal.

Summary

If the CP-OFDM waveform is at its maximum allowed power, the DFT-s-OFDM waveform can

provide a higher average transmission power. So the power amplifier efficiency can

be improved by using DFT-s-OFDM waveform.

Dynamic switching between the DFT-s-OFDM and CP-OFDM waveforms is also possible. With

dynamic switching, CP-OFDM waveform can be used in good radio conditions, and

DFT-s-OFDM waveform in poor radio conditions, which improves the uplink throughput.

The waveform switching options can be configured for each UE group.

The DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink feature is supported for Low-Band and Mid-Band FDD

and TDD cells, with 15-kHz or 30-kHz subcarrier spacing.

The feature is supported with the following modulations:

- QPSK
- 16-QAM
- 64-QAM
- 256-QAM

# 2 Dependencies of DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink

The feature has dependencies to other features related to uplink transmissions and UE

grouping. Some chipsets do not support DFT-s-OFDM waveform.

- π/2 BPSK is not supported.

Network Requirements

UEs built on the following chipsets do not support the DFT-s-OFDM waveform:

- Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ X50 CS1.0
- Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ X50 CS1.1
- Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ X55 CS1.0

To maintain interoperability, UEs with these chipsets are not configured for

DFT-s-OFDM, even if the DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink feature is activated in the

cell. DFT-s-OFDM for Msg3 must be disabled in cells where UEs with these chipsets

might appear, as it is not possible to differentiate the configuration of DFT-s-OFDM

or CP-OFDM for different UEs for Msg3.

It is recommended to use 23.1 or later to support the MOM for

waveform switching and UE grouping. If the Release Independence Manager application

is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink

DFT-s-OFDM or CP-OFDM waveform is used by the UE depending on the channel conditions.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The UE sends the RACH preamble (Msg1).
2. The gNodeB replies with Msg2.
3. The UE sends Msg3 with CP-OFDM or DFT-s-OFDM waveform, depending on the configuration in the RACH-ConfigCommon RRC information element.
4. The gNodeB informs the UE to use DFT-s-OFDM or CP-OFDM waveform for regular PUSCH transmissions in the PUSCH-Config interface element.

Waveform Switching

Dynamic switching between the CP-OFDM and the DFT-s-OFDM waveforms happens according

to the following principles:

- Switching to DFT-s-OFDM is triggered if the UE is in poor coverage in uplink.
- Switching to CP-OFDM is triggered if the UE is in good coverage in uplink.
- Switching is only allowed after a given period of time to avoid rapid switching between the waveforms.

Waveform switching helps to dynamically adapt the uplink transmissions to changing

channel conditions.

The gNodeB can configure the UE to use the CP-OFDM waveform to enable the

multiplexing of uplink data in the DMRS symbol. This improves throughput.

For EN-DC-capable UEs, the gNodeB configures CP-OFDM or DFT-s-OFDM waveform in the

X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message depending on the

RSRP reported in the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message.

The DFT-s-OFDM waveform allows for higher average UE transmission power than the

CP-OFDM waveform, so the uplink throughput and the uplink coverage are increased.

# 4 Network Impact of DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink

The feature can improve uplink throughput and coverage in some cases, mostly affecting

UEs at the cell edge.

Capacity and Performance

The DFT-s-OFDM waveform allows less power reductions in the power amplifier of a UE,

which might improve the uplink throughput and coverage in cases where the UE power

is the limiting factor.

The effect of the feature depends on the distribution of UEs in a cell, mostly

affecting UEs at the cell edge.

When the feature is activated, the average SINR reported by UEs in a

cell can be higher.

Given the right network conditions, fewer UEs transmit at the maximum power allowed

by the cell. In such cases, their PHR shows that they have power

headroom left.

Waveform switching affects the network in the following ways:

- When waveform switching is enabled, NR uplink throughput can increase depending on the traffic model and the setting of the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute before the activation of waveform switching. Uplink throughput impact can be observed for full buffer uplink traffic and is most visible in very good and in poor radio conditions. The impact can be different for EN-DC and NR SA. This can be observed with existing NR uplink throughput KPIs.
- In uplink, if the coverage is limited, retainability is expected to improve when waveform switching is activated compared to when only the CP-OFDM waveform is used.
- Retainability can degrade because of the additional RRC signaling for inactive UEs in poor SINR conditions. This can be related to specific UEs. If retainability is degraded, UE grouping can be used to create optimized configuration for the affected UEs.

Interfaces

The following information elements in RRC message are modified:

- PUSCH-Config
- RACH-ConfigCommon

When the waveform switching conditions are fulfilled, the RRC Reconfiguration

procedure is performed, which modifies the PUSCH-Config information

element.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Summary and Benefits

Uplink throughput at initial context setup for EN-DC can be optimized by configuring

the CP-OFDM or DFT-s-OFDM waveform, depending on the RSRP reported in the

X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message.

The gNodeB can configure the UE to use the CP-OFDM waveform to enable the

multiplexing of uplink data in the DMRS symbol. This improves throughput. The

CP-OFDM waveform is used when the UE is in good coverage.

When the UE moves into poor coverage, the gNodeB reconfigures the UE to use the

DFT-s-OFDM waveform. The DFT-s-OFDM waveform allows for higher average UE

transmission power than the CP-OFDM waveform, so the uplink throughput and the

uplink coverage can increase.

Capacity and Performance

When waveform switching is enabled, NR uplink throughput can increase depending on

the traffic model and the setting of the

NRCellDU.dftsOfdmPuschEnabled attribute before the activation

of waveform switching. Uplink throughput impact can be observed for full buffer

uplink traffic and is most visible in very good and in poor radio conditions. The

impact can be different for EN-DC and NR SA. This can be observed with existing NR

uplink throughput KPIs.

In uplink, if the coverage is limited, retainability is expected to improve when

waveform switching is activated compared to using only the CP-OFDM waveform.

Retainability can degrade because of the additional RRC signaling for inactive UEs in

poor SINR conditions. This can be related to specific UEs. If retainability is

degraded, UE grouping can be used to create optimized configuration for the affected

UEs.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the effects of the function:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacCpofdmTransUl
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacDftsTransUl
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlCpofdm
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchAttUlDfts
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlCpofdm
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacWvfSwitchSuccUlDfts

Operation

The UlWfPortSwitch and the UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg

MOs are introduced. The waveform switching function can be controlled with the

attributes in the UlWfPortSwitchingUeCfg MO.

The following attributes are introduced to control the function:

- UeBbProfileUeCfg.ulWfPortSwitchUeCfgRef
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.reservedBy
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulWfPuschStartFr1RsrpThresh
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulWfSwitchFr1CpRetProhibTimer
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulWfSwitchFr1Mode
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulWfSwitchFr1QualHyst
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulWfSwitchFr1QualThresh
- UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.userLabel

The NRCellDU.dftsOfdmPuschEnabled attribute is updated to support

the UE Grouping Framework.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

When the waveform switching conditions are fulfilled, the RRC Reconfiguration

procedure is performed, which modifies the PUSCH-Config information

element.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use an ENM version later than 23.1 to support the MOM changes introduced by this

feature enhancement. If an UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg MO instance is

created with 23.1 or earlier ENM version, the value of the

UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulWfSwitchFr1Mode attribute must be

explicitly set, otherwise the CP\_OFDM\_NOSWITCH value is set as

default. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes

are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
