# 1 Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction Overview

The feature reduces the downlink latency by increasing the responsiveness of the

downlink scheduler by an enhanced buffer reporting mechanism.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4994                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | Spectral Efficiency                          |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1015                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

The feature reduces latency by detecting downlink buffer data status and actively acquiring

downlink scheduling resources. The latency improvement increases if many small

downlink packets are scheduled in the network because the feature can be triggered

easier for the UE.

# 2 Dependencies of Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction

This feature can lower the efficiency of the Micro Sleep Tx feature.

| Micro Sleep Tx (FAJ 121                                 3089) | Related        | The Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction feature can increase PRB                                 usage. This can lower the efficiency of the energy saving function                                 of the Micro Sleep Tx feature. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The effect of the latency improvement is reduced as the system load increases.

Network Requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction

The feature detects if the eNodeB has new data indication and forwards it to the

scheduler.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The eNodeB indicates that it has new data in the buffer.
2. The Radio Link Control (RLC) detects data indication of the eNodeB.
3. The RLC forwards the data indication directly to the scheduler and starts to request scheduling resources.

# 4 Network Impact of Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction

This feature can cause increased PRB utilization and power consumption.

Capacity and Performance

This feature can increase PRB utilization, which results in a slightly increased

power consumption. The PRB utilization depends on the traffic types used by the UEs.

The downlink throughput for the UE can decrease.

The latency gain is reduced as the system load increases.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction

There are no configuration parameters for this feature.

# 6 Performance of Downlink User Plane Latency Reduction

The feature operation can be observed with decreasing KPIs, and with several PM

counters.
