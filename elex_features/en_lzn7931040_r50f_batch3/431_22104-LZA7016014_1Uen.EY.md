# 1 NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity Overview

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature provides basic connected mode

mobility to an NR network. When the feature is active, the UE can be directed to transfer

from the LTE network to the NR network while maintaining the data session.

Summary

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature manages the redirection of

UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode to an NR network when the UE measures

good coverage in an NR frequency. Redirection is controlled by the network and

triggered by UE measurement reports of the available NR cell.

The feature provides system information about alternative NR networks that can be used by a UE

in RRC\_IDLE mode. This happens when the UE measures better

coverage in an NR cell than the current LTE cell.

If this feature is not activated, the UE stays connected to the LTE network even if an NR cell

with good coverage is available.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Network capacity is improved because the UE is served by the best available RAT.
- Service performance for an individual UE is increased by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available RAT.
- Session transition to an NR network is possible with reduced interruptions to data flows during the transition process.
- Idle mode transition to an NR network is facilitated by the transmission of SIB broadcast messages.

The subpriority configuration for NR frequencies has the following benefits:

- NR carriers with the same priority are differentiated at cell reselection.
- UEs that can understand and use subpriority have more flexibility at idle mode reselection.
- Operators get better support at introduction of NR carriers on top of the existing LTE networks, while keeping the existing priority strategies.

The Outgoing NR IRAT             Handover feature is built on the framework of the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session             Continuity feature and reuses the B1 NR measurements initiated for RwR.  The B1 NR measurements are only             configured in the UE if good coverage is reported.  The B1 NR measurements are also blocked for             the UE in the following cases:  The UE is interested in MBMS on the serving frequency.     The UE is interested in MBMS on any frequency and MBMS is SCell capable.      The B2 NR measurements are only             configured on the UE if poor coverage is reported. If the UE indicates poor coverage,             existing B1 NR standalone measurements are deconfigured and new ones are blocked.  When the UE is                 moved to an LTE cell from NR Standalone by any of the following functions, the                 handover to the affected NR frequency is not initiated if the restriction is                   enabled:  The Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic                       Steering feature     The NR Data-Aware Mobility feature     Uplink-triggered Mobility Control at Poor Coverage for NR Standalone of the                       NR Mobility feature     The Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic                       Offload feature     The restriction can be enabled by setting the                   ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute to a                 value other than 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If theUePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to                                     2 or 3, Release with Redirect                                 attempts to NR in connected mode can decrease, as the NR                                 standalone-capable UE can select an NR frequency immediately in idle                                 mode.  The NR frequencies can be restricted due to the following reasons:  The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature                                             is not activated.     There is no NR frequency relation.     The NR restriction in 5GS IE is                                             detected in the HRL.     The Serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs included in the HRL                                             are not present in any                                                 GUtranFreqRelation.allowedPLMNList.    The Serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs indicated by the HRL                                         are included as 5GCFordbidden in the                                             Mobility Restriction List IE.     When the UE is                 moved to an LTE cell from NR Standalone, the affected NR frequency is excluded from                 the IMMCI IE in the RRCConnectionRelease message when                 all of the following criteria are true:    The UE is moved by one of the following functions:  The Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic                           Steering feature     The Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic                           Offload feature         The NR frequency priorities are changed by the TM9                                             Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature.     The value of the ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled                     attribute is set to 2. |

GSCN value as specified in TS 38.101.

Network Requirements

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature redirects UEs to an NR

network when the NR cell coverage becomes good enough and the conditions for UE handover are

not fulfilled.

This feature uses the B1 measurement process. The B1 measurement indicates that coverage

of an NR network is good enough for the UE to connect to the network. B1 measurement on

the selected NR frequencies can be configured to search for an NR cell when an

NR-capable UE is connected in the E-UTRAN cell.

If the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is

activated and the UE in connected mode measures good coverage in the NR cell, the

Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature takes precedence over the Release with Redirect (RwR)

function of the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature. If the handover to

the NR cell cannot be initiated, RwR is triggered.

For more information, see Outgoing NR IRAT Handover.

Release with Redirect

The UE uses the measurement parameters sent by the serving eNodeB for the measurement

process to evaluate the serving cell. These parameters sent to the UE in the

RRC RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages include the following

information:

- Threshold values
- Hysteresis values
- Time-to-trigger parameters

The time-to-trigger parameters are included in the evaluation to prevent redirection

to an NR network based on a small number of measurements taken during a rapid fade

in the radio link. Hysteresis prevents the retriggering of the B1 measurement and

triggering of the unnecessary UE measurement report transmissions.

The UE measurements are reported to the serving eNodeB to make the final decision on

redirection to an NR network.

The triggering criterion of the B1 measurement can be based on the following

measurements:

| RSRP   |    | Indicates the mean measured power per reference signal.                                                        |
|--------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        |    |                                                                                                                |
| RSRQ   |    | Indicates the reference signal quality, for example, high inter                             cell-interference. |

The eNodeB determines whether to release the UE with a redirection to an NR network

based on the following criteria:

- UE capabilities
- eNodeB licenses
- Redirection priority

If the UE is released with redirection to an NR network, the release message can

contain the RedirectedCarrierInfo IE to help the UE find a suitable

NR cell.

Cell Reselection

The feature enables the UE in idle mode to initiate cell reselection if a suitable NR

cell is found.

The eNodeB broadcasts the SIB24 IE that contains the information for

inter-RAT cell reselection. The SIB24 IE allows NR-capable UEs in

idle mode to select the most suitable NR cell.

The UE performs measurements for NR cell reselection based on the

SIB24 IE. Reselection measurements for higher-priority NR cells

are performed periodically. Reselection measurements for lower-priority NR cells are

performed if the serving cell coverage becomes poor, and the lower-priority cell

coverage becomes good.

For more information about idle mode cell reselection, see Idle Mode Support.

## 3.1 Outgoing NR IRAT Handover at Good LTE Coverage

This feature uses B1 NR standalone measurements to select a mobility action for UEs

in good LTE coverage.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram of Outgoing NR IRAT Handover at Good LTE

Coverage

Figure 2   EN-DC and Voice Bearer Check

Outgoing NR IRAT Handover at Good LTE Coverage

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB checks if the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature can configure B1 NR measurements. The feature can configure B1 NR measurements if the following conditions are met: If the feature is not operable, the eNodeB stops the B1 measurement NR measurement process.
    - The license is activated.
    - The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasEnabled attribute is set to true.
    - The UE supports NR Standalone.
    - The UE supports VoNR if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
    - The ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
    - There are no ongoing emergency calls. Note: Emergency calls are defined with a QCI1 bearer or with a bearer where the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute is set to VoIP. If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default value of -1, the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) value of an emergency call must be higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. Otherwise, the ARP value must be equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute.
    - There are no ongoing MC-PTT voice connections.
3. The eNodeB starts the configurable UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas timer.
4. The UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas timer expires.
5. The eNodeB checks if B1 NR measurements are allowed. EN-DC and voice-type bearers might cause the eNodeB to stop the measurement process. If the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasAtEndcEnabled attribute is set to true, EN-DC bearers do not prB1 measurement NR measurements. If the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true, ongoing VoLTE connections do not prB1 measurement NR measurements. The following bearers are regarded as voice-type bearers: VoLTE bearers (bearers with QCI1) MC-PTT bearers (bearers with QCI65, QCI66, or QCI69) Note: Ongoing calls configured with MC-PTT bearers always prB1 measurement NR measurements. A bearer configured with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType set to VOIP is not considered as a voice-type bearer.
6. The eNodeB determines the NR frequency candidates to configure the B1 measurement NR measurement. NR frequencies configured by the GUtranFreqRelation MO class are selected as candidates up to the value of the UeMeasControl.maxMeasNR attribute based on the priority configured in the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute. The priority is configured in the GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute for UEs with an ongoing VoLTE connection.
7. The eNodeB checks the NR frequency candidates in the GUtranFreqRelation MO. If there is no NR frequency candidate, the eNodeB stops the B1 measurement NR measurement process.
8. The eNodeB configures the B1 measurement NR measurement for the determined NR frequency candidates to the UE and starts the configurable waitForNRMeas timer. For more details, see the Calculation of the waitForNRMeas Timer.
9. The eNodeB waits for the measurement report from the UE. If the waitForNRMeas timer expires before a measurement report is received, the eNodeB deconfigures the existing B1 NR measurement and starts the configurable UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer. If the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer expires, see Step 5.
10. When the measurement report is received from the UE, the eNodeB evaluates the candidate cell to determine if the target is valid for mobility. If the eNodeB receives a B1 NR measurement report that contains a cell with not the highest frequency priority value and the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is set to a value above 0, the timer is started.Note: The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is started based on the priorities defined in the FreqPrioNR MO class if the UE has a SPID value.
11. If the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is enabled and the target cell is valid for IRAT inter-system handover, the eNodeB initiates handover to the reported cell.
12. If the target cell is not valid for IRAT inter-system handover, but it is valid for RwR, the eNodeB initiates RRC connection RwR to the reported NR frequency. The following types of RwR to NR procedures can be performed: RwR to NR is performed without the validation of the target NR cell if the following conditions apply: There is no ExternalGUtranCell MO for the reported PCI and frequency. The UE does not have an HRL. RwR to NR is performed with validation if the following conditions apply: At least one ExternalGUtranCell.pLMNIdList or ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList attribute exists with a value that is included in the HRL of the UE. For the PLMN that is included in the HRL of the UE, a non-empty ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC or ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute exists with a value other than -1. Note: The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature checks the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO first, and if this MO does not exist, the value of the ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC attribute is checked. If RwR is not possible, the handover process goes back to Step 9 and the B1 measurement report is discarded. Note: VoLTE connections are not valid for RwR even if the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true.

EN-DC Check Process

1. An EN-DC bearer is set up while the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is operable.
2. The eNodeB checks if the EN-DC bearer prevents B1 NR measurements. If the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasAtEndcEnabled attribute is set to true, the EN-DC bearer does not interrupt the measurement process.
3. The eNodeB checks if there are ongoing B1 NR measurements in cases when the EN-DC bearer interrupts the measurement process.
4. The eNodeB deconfigures existing B1 NR measurements.
5. The eNodeB stops the B1 NR measurement process.
6. The eNodeB waits until the EN-DC bearer is released. If the EN-DC bearer is released, see Step 3.

Voice Bearer Check Process

1. A voice bearer is set up while the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is operable.
2. The eNodeB checks if the voice bearer prevents B1 NR measurements. If the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true and the UE supports VoNR, the VoLTE connections do not interrupt the measurement process.Note: Emergency calls and bearers configured with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute set to MC\_SIGNALING or PTT always interrupt the B1 NR measurement process.
3. The eNodeB checks if there are ongoing B1 NR measurements in cases when the voice bearer interrupts the measurement process.
4. The eNodeB deconfigures existing B1 NR measurements.
5. The eNodeB stops the B1 NR measurement process.
6. The eNodeB waits until the last voice bearer is released. If the voice bearer is released, see Step 5.

## 3.2 Mobility back to NR after incoming IRAT handover

1. The ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute allows disabling mobility back to the source NR frequency after the UE is moved to LTE by either of the following features: The Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic Steering feature The NR Data-Aware Mobility feature Uplink-triggered Mobility Control at Poor Coverage for NR Standalone of the NR Mobility feature The DisabledMobilityModeBackToNr enum of the ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute has the following values: NO\_RESTRICTION = 0 CONNECTED\_MODE\_MOBILITY = 1 CONNECTED\_IDLE\_MODE\_MOBILITY = 2 Note: The connected mode mobility restriction is enabled by default. The source NR frequency is disabled for mobility when the ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set to a value other than 0.
2. The gNodeB triggers an IRAT inter-system handover.
3. The eNodeB identifies the cause of the handover and blocks mobility to the source NR frequency to avoid ping-pong effect. The following cases are distinguished: In connected mode mobility the eNodeB does not configure B1 NR measurements to the source NR frequency. In this case, the ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set to a value other than 0. In idle mode mobility the cell reselection to the source NR frequency is blocked. In this case, the ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set to 2. Note: A GUtranCellRelation MO must exist to enable matching the NCGI measurement with the NR frequency. The frequency restriction ends in the following cases: If the t320 timer expires. If the UE goes back to connected mode. If the UE moves to another LTE cell.

## 3.3 NR Mobility after NR Traffic Offload

The undesired ping-pong effect can be prevented by excluding the source NR frequency

from connected mode and idle mode mobility.

After the UE is moved to an LTE cell by the NR Traffic Offload feature, the source NR

frequency previously used by the UE can be excluded from the list of possible handover

target frequencies. This is done to prevent subsequent handover attempts back to the NR

cell. This can be done by using the following attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled
- RATFreqPrio.mobBackToNrFreqDisabled
- UeProfileFilter.mobBackToNrFreqDisabled

The restrictions on handover back to the source NR frequency are time-limited. The

time limits for UEs with SPID are defined as follows:

- In connected mode, the following parameters are used: RATFreqPrio.mobBackToNrFreqDisabledTime UeProfileFilter.mobBackToNrFreqDisabledTime
- In idle mode, the T320 timer is used.

## 3.4 Measurement Configuration for NR

B1 Measurement NR

The B1 measurement NR implies that the neighboring NR cell becomes better than the

threshold. This measurement is used when searching for a suitable target NR cell for

an NR-capable UE.

If the LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone feature is active and an NR

SA-capable UE performs emergency service in the LTE network, the emergency

inactivity timer extension is activated. This disables B1 measurement configuration.

The measurement can be configured if the timer extension expires and any of the

following conditions are fulfilled:

- The QCI5 bearer with an ARP for emergency is released.
- The QoS of the QCI5 bearer changes to a non-emergency ARP value.

The B1 measurements are configured on the UE only if it is in good coverage. If the

UE indicates poor coverage, existing B1 measurements are deconfigured and new ones

are blocked. B1 measurements are restored if the UE detects good coverage.

B2 Measurement NR

The B2 measurements are configured if the UE detects poor coverage and there are no

ongoing B1 NR measurements.

## 3.5 SIB24 Broadcast

If SIB24 is scheduled in SIB1 using the additional scheduling list for NR SA-capable UEs

which cannot support these additional lists, cell reselection does not happen in idle

mode.

## 3.6 Cell Reselection Subpriority

To differentiate cell reselection priority for NR carriers, subpriority configuration

is supported. For frequency relations from LTE to NR, subpriority configuration enables the

differentiation of absolute priorities at idle mode reselection.

This function enables the configuration of cell reselection subpriority for the NR

frequencies.

Subpriority configuration for NR frequencies has the

following benefits:

- NR carriers with the same priority are differentiated at cell reselection.
- UEs that can understand and use subpriority have more flexibility at idle mode reselection.
- Operators get better support at introduction of NR carriers on top of the existing LTE networks, while keeping the existing priority strategies.

The subpriority is configured with the

GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute.

If the attribute is configured with a value other than 0, the cell

reselection subpriority information is included in the SIB24 message.

If all the following conditions are true, the subpriority information is included in the

IMMCI at RRC Connection Release:

- The GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute is configured with a value other than 0.
- The UE is NR standalone-capable.

The absolute priority for NR carriers is calculated by adding the subpriority information

to the priority index according to the following formula:

For example, if the priority value for several NR carriers is 7, the NR

carriers can be differentiated using the subpriority index in the following way:

Table 2   Absolute Priority Example

|   Subpriority Index Values |   Absolute Priority |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
|                        0.2 |                 7.2 |
|                        0.4 |                 7.4 |
|                        0.6 |                 7.6 |
|                        0.8 |                 7.8 |

## 3.7 Calculation of the waitForNRMeas Timer

The waitForNRMeas timer equals the sum of the following two

attributes if the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override

attribute is set to its default value for all frequency relations:

waitForNRMeas = UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt +

ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1

If the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attributes are

set to values different than their default values, the

waitForNRMeas timer is calculated as follows:

waitForNRMeas = UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt +

max(GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override)

# 4 Network Impact of NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature provides mobility for NR-capable

UEs to NR

networks.

Capacity and Performance

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature improves network capacity. It

increases the possibility of the UE being served by the best available network.

Mobility is improved because RRC-connected UEs can be redirected to an NR network.

The time for transitioning to an NR network is reduced.

The validation check for the target NR cell for the RwR to NR procedure prevents

repeated RwR attempts to non-suitable NR cells. Because of this, the number of RwR

to NR procedures decreases.

Interfaces

The enhancement affects the RRC Protocol (TS 36.331) interface.

# 6 Performance of NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature introduces counters and

events to observe the feature operation.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

The following PM counters can decrease when RwR is not performed:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelSCNr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrp
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrq
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelSCNr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrp
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrq

The following PM counters can increase because the UE sends repeated B1 measurement

reports for non-suitable NR cells:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmB1BestCellEvalReport
- EUtranCellFDD.pmB1BestCellEvalReportRsrp
- EUtranCellTDD.pmB1BestCellEvalReport
- EUtranCellTDD.pmB1BestCellEvalReportRsrp

The following counters can also be used to observe the operation of the feature:

- GUtranFreqRelation.pmConnModeMobilityExcluded
- GUtranFreqRelation.pmIdleModeMobilityExcluded

# 7 Activate NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

The license key is installed in the node.

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012324 MO instance.

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012324 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature needs to be configured for

optimal operation.

Configure SIB24 Broadcast

SIB24 contains information and parameters required by the UE to perform idle mode

reselection to the NR network. To configure a cell to broadcast SIB24, the

GUtranFreqRelation MOs must be added as children of the

EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO instance

of the cell.

If EUtranCellFDD.sib1AltSchInfo  or

EUtranCellTDD.sib1AltSchInfo is set to true,

UEs capable of handling SIB19 and higher must support 3GPP CR4444 TS

36.331. Otherwise, UEs cannot receive information included in these SIBs.

For example, a UE is not able to receive SIB24 with NR information if the following

conditions apply:

- The UE is not updated according to 3GPP CR4444 TS 36.331.
- The value of sib1AltSchInfo is set to true.

## 9.1 Configure Release with Redirect to NR

Steps

1. Create GUtranFreqRelation MO instance for each NR frequency that is a candidate for RwR.
2. Set the selection priority of NR frequencies in the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute. Note: To exclude a GUtranFreqRelation MO instance from RwR, set the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute to -1. Note: NR frequencies having ARFCN value not corresponding to a GSCN value as specified in TS 38.101 must be excluded for Release with Redirect to NR. Note: NR frequencies involving ESS NR cell with inactive IssSupportForNrStandalone optional feature license are not recommended to be configured for Release with Redirection to NR.
3. Set the selection priority of NR frequencies for VoLTE connections in the GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
4. Set the parameters of ReportConfigB1NR MO instance for Event B1 NR report configuration.
5. Optional: Set the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute to a value different than its default value to enable the use of different time-to-trigger values for each frequency relation. Note: This step is optional. The different time-to-trigger values increase the possibility of prioritizing the affected frequency over the other frequencies during the B1 measurement.
6. Configure the following parameters for periodic B1 measurement configuration: ReportConfigB1GUtra.reportIntervalB1 UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt If the UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt attribute is set to -1, the waitForNRMeas timer does not expire, and the configured B1 measurement is not deconfigured by the timer. UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas If the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas attribute is set to -1, the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer does not expire, and the B1 measurement is not configured again after deconfiguration by the waitForNRMeas timer.
7. Configure the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasEnabled parameter to enable the feature activation on each cell. Feature activation on the nodes is controlled by license.

## 9.2 Configure Threshold for B1 NR Measurement Report

The RSRP and RSRQ threshold values that trigger the B1 measurement can be configured

separately.

Steps

1. The trigger quantity for B1 measurements can be set with the ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR attribute: Option Description Set ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR to SS\_RSRP. The ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute configures the RSRP threshold value. Set ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR to SS\_RSRQ. The ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrq attribute configures the RSRQ threshold value.
2. Set the RSRP or RSRQ threshold for B1 measurement:
    - Set the RSRP threshold with ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrp.
    - Set the RSRQ threshold with ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrq.

## 9.3 B1 Measurement Configuration to Prioritize Mobility Actions to Different NR Frequencies

Two configuration methods to enable NR frequency prioritization for B1

measurement-based mobility actions.

Time-to-Trigger Override Method

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute must

be set to a value other than -1000 to override the

ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1 attribute.

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute

allows the use of different time-to-trigger values for each frequency relation. This

attribute is used instead of the ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1

attribute if the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override

attribute is not set to its default value. The different time-to-trigger values

increase the possibility of prioritizing the affected frequency over the other

frequencies during the B1 measurement.

Time Window Method

The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attribute must be set to a value

of

40

or higher to make the timer operational.

The eNodeB stores the first B1 measurement report, but waits for the next measurement

report with a higher priority frequency until the timer expires.

If the priority of the frequency in the new measurement report is lower than in the

stored measurement report, the new report is ignored.

If the priority of the frequency in the new measurement report is equal to or higher

than in the stored measurement report, the new report replaces the stored

report.

If the priority of the frequency in the measurement report is the highest possible

configured for the UE, the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer

stops and the mobility action is triggered.

When the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow or the configurable

waitForNRMeas

timer expires, the eNodeB uses the latest stored measurement

report to trigger the mobility action to

NR

standalone.

Combined Method

If the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override and the

UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attributes are used together,

the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attribute

must be set to a lower value for a higher priority frequency. Improper configuration

might cause unnecessary delay in the mobility action to NR standalone.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q1: Release with Redirect to NR

This enhancement enables the redirection of NR capable UEs in RRC connected

mode to an NR network from an LTE network.

| Feature Name:           | NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4983                                  |
| Value Package Name:     | Basic NR Mobility Support                     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1018  R2                              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node            |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                           |

The eNodeB controls the redirection of the UEs from the LTE network to the NR

network. UE measurements of the NR coverage trigger the redirection to NR

networks.

Capacity and Performance

Network capacity is improved, because the UEs are served by the available NR

network that has higher capacity.

Mobility is improved, because RRC connected UEs can be redirected to an NR

network. The time for transitioning to an NR network is reduced.

The measurements for NR frequencies can have a negative impact on UE

performance.

Operation

The following parameters are introduced to configure RwR towards an NR

network:

- UeMeasControl.rwrToNRAllowed
- UeMeasControl.maxMeasNR
- UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas
- UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt
- UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas
- ReportConfigB1NR.b1Threshold
- ReportConfigB1NR.hysteresisB1
- ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1
- ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR
- GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- GUtranFreqRelation.qOffsetFreq

The following counters are introduced to observe the feature operation:

- pmUeCtxtRelSCNr
- pmFlexUeCtxtRelSCNr
- pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrp
- pmUeCtxtRelSCNrB1Rsrq
- pmB1BestCellEvalReport
- pmB1BestCellEvalReportRsrp

The INTERNAL\_EVENT\_MEAS\_CONFIG\_B1\_NR event is introduced.

The following event parameters are modified for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_UE\_MOBILITY\_EVAL event:

| EVENT_PARAM_REDIRECT_RELEASE_INFO   |    | The EVENT_VALUE_NR enum value is introduced.                                                       |

differentiation of absolute priorities of NR frequency carriers at idle mode cell

reselection for the operator. Sub-priority information is carried in the SIB24 message and

in the IMMCI at RRC connection release.

Summary and Benefits

Sub-priority is introduced to differentiate absolute priorities at idle mode cell

reselection.

Sub-priority

allows to increase differentiation of frequency priorities, which

enables to prioritize the NR

frequencies.

The sub-priority information for NR frequencies is broadcast in the SIB24 message, or

sent in the IMMCI at RRC Connection Release. Operators must configure the

sub-priority with a value other than zero for the eNodeB to be able to send

sub-priority information to the NR SA UE for reselection to NR and idle mode

measurements. The sub-priority information is ignored by the UEs that do not

understand or use this information, including some NR SA capable

UEs.Operators

can configure sub-priorities for each NR frequency relation.

This enhancement supports the operators at the introduction of the NR carriers on top

of the LTE networks, while keeping the existing priority strategies.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute is

introduced for the configuration of cell reselection sub-priority for NR carrier

frequencies.

If the value of the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority

attribute is 0, the sub-priority information is not sent to the

UE.

If a value other than 0 is configured,

additional

CellReselectionSubPriority-r15 IE is included in the SIB24 and

IMMCI.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Interfaces

This feature affects the RRC protocol. For more details, see the TS

36.331 3GPP standard.

The GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute is

carried in the CellReselectionSubPriority-r15 IE, which is included

in the SIB24 message and IMMCI at the RRC connection release.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                      |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves the NR Standalone frequency priority handling with

the introduction of different time-to-trigger values for NR SA B1 measurements and a

configurable time window.

The different time-to-trigger values for each frequency relation increase the

flexibility of measurement configuration and band priority control.

The configurable time window allows more time for the UE to report the availability

of a higher priority cell.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on the GutranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override

attribute settings, the number of handovers might decrease or increase. The lower

the value, the greater number of handover attempts are possible.

The configuration of the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attribute

might affect the mobility performance by delaying mobility action.

If the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override and the

UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow attributes are used together,

the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override attribute must

be set to a lower value for a higher priority frequency. Improper configuration

might cause unnecessary delay in the mobility action to NR Standalone. As a result,

the number of handover reattempts might increase.

Operation

The following attributes are introduced:

- GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1Override
- UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the RRC protocol on the Uu interface. Time-to-trigger

values are sent in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message during

the measurement configuration.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.16 22.4 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release

Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier

ENM versions also.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement excludes the source NR frequency from connected mode and

idle mode mobility back to NR Standalone when the UE is moved to LTE by the

Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function. As a result, the UE avoids the

undesired ping-pong effect.

A cell relation must exist to enable matching the NCGI measurement with the NR

frequency.

Capacity and Performance

The number of mobility actions to NR Standalone can decrease when this feature

enhancement is operable.

Operation

The ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled MO attribute is

introduced.

The DisabledMobilityModeBackToNr enum is introduced by the

ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute to

manage mobility to the related NR frequency.

This

feature enhancement is operable when the

EnodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set

to a value other than 0.

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to observe the number

of times the NR frequency is ignored as target for mobility:

- GUtranFreqRelation.pmConnModeMobilityExcluded
- GUtranFreqRelation.pmIdleModeMobilityExcluded

This feature enhancement introduces the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_FREQUENCY\_EXCLUDED PM event.

It

is created when NR frequency is excluded from mobility back to NR.

In idle mode mobility, the NR Mobility After Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System

Handover function operates on an already prepared IMMCI IE. The activation of a

feature triggering the IMMCI IE creation and addition to the

RRCConnectionRelease message is required.

Interfaces

No Impact

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

UEs must support connected mode and idle mode mobility to NR Standalone to fully

benefit from this enhancement.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                      |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement excludes the source NR frequency from connected mode and

idle mode mobility back to NR SA when a UE with a specific SPID is moved

from

NR SA  to LTE by the NR Traffic Offload feature. As a result, UEs

with specific SPID value avoid ping-pong effect for a

defined

time.

Capacity and Performance

The number of mobility actions to

NR

SA decreases when this feature enhancement is enabled.

Operation

The ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is

updated to enable the functionality provided by this feature enhancement. The

enhancement is operational only when the

ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set

to a value other than 0.

The INTERNAL\_EVENT\_NR\_FREQUENCY\_EXCLUDED event is updated to be

created when the source NR frequency is excluded from mobility back to NR

Standalone.

The following PM counters are updated to include cases where the source NR frequeny

is excluded from idle and connected mode mobility back to NR SA:

- GUtranFreqRelation.pmConnModeMobilityExcluded
- GUtranFreqRelation.pmIdleModeMobilityExcluded

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

UEs must support connected mode and idle mode mobility to NR SA to fully benefit from

this enhancement.
