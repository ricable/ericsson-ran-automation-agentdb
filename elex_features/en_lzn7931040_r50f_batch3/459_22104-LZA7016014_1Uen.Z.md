Summary

The VoLTE Rate Recommendation feature enables support for VoLTE call codec rate adaptation in

the UE by allowing the eNodeB to send recommended uplink bit rate. The uplink bit

rate limits the quality of the VoLTE calls.

The used VoLTE codec rate is defined at the beginning of the VoLTE call, which affects the

call quality if the coverage becomes worse. When this feature is activated, the

eNodeB monitors radio network conditions, and sends optimal uplink physical bit rate

to the UEs which support RAN-assisted codec adaptation specified in 3GPP Release 14.

The time interval for bit rate recommendations from the eNodeB is measured in

seconds according to 3GPP TS 36.321. The UE adapts the recommended bit

rate to codec rate based on the algorithm of the UE.

In poor radio conditions, a lower bit rate is recommended, and if it is accepted by the UE,

the lower codec rate results in fewer dropped packets through the call. In good

radio conditions a higher bit rate is proposed, and the UE adapts to the

recommendation, if this is supported. Using higher bit rates improves speech

quality.

The UE can also initiate a recommended bit rate query, if a peer UE suggests increasing the

codec rate in an ongoing VoLTE call.

The VoLTE Rate Recommendation feature improves VoLTE call quality by achieving better VoIP

Integrity, especially when high VoLTE codec rate is used. For example, if the EVS

voice codec with 24.4 kbps bit rate is used and the UE is at the cell edge, the

feature recommends reducing the codec bit rate before the UE disconnects.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The eNodeB provides recommendation for uplink only.

The feature is not supported on the following UEs:

- NB-IoT
- Category M1

Network Requirements

The UE must support RAN-assisted codec adaptation as specified in 3GPP Release

14.

# 3 Feature Operation of VoLTE Rate Recommendation

The feature enables using optimal codec rates by UEs in VoLTE calls. This is achieved

through analyzing uplink properties of VoLTE radio bearers and comparing them to predefined

thresholds.

Once the VoLTE Rate Recommendation feature is activated, radio conditions are

continuously measured, and bit rate index recommendations are periodically calculated

and sent to UEs in VoLTE calls at configured intervals. Initially the eNodeB prepares

the index value of 0, which means the eNodeB does not have any

recommendation. After this, the uplink throughput of VoLTE radio bearers is analyzed for

UEs in VoLTE calls.

If the throughput analysis result does not meet the optimal bit rate value for the UE,

the eNodeB recommends a new bit rate index to the UE. This can be a lower or a higher

bit rate index than the one currently used.

The time interval for bit rate recommendations from the eNodeB is measured in seconds

according to 3GPP TS 36.321. UEs can also query for a new rate

recommendation.

The feature is enabled or disabled for each QCI profile.

The recommendations sent to the UEs can be further refined by setting the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled attribute to

true to improve bit rate response speed.

The possible bit rate recommendation refinements are the following:

- When radio conditions are exceptionally poor, the lowest possible bit rate index is recommended.
- When radio conditions are exceptionally good, the highest possible bit rate index is recommended.
- When the bit rate index is gradually changed, the bit rate index recommendations are in three-step adjustments.

If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled or

the EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled attribute is set to

false, all bit rate index recommendations are made in one-step

adjustments.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. In each TTI, the scheduler allocates resources for UEs in the radio network.
2. If the scheduled packets are for a VoLTE radio bearer, the analysis of uplink throughput of this logical channel is performed.
3. The current throughput of the UE is compared to the throughput required by the UE. If the configured minimum recommendation time to get a stabilized result is passed, another bit rate recommendation is prepared. The EUtranCellFDD.bitRateDownRecommTimer or the EUtranCellTDD.bitRateDownRecommTimer attribute can be configured to determine the minimum recommendation time of the bit rate index when the bit rate index decreases. The EUtranCellFDD.bitRateUpRecommTimer or the EUtranCellTDD.bitRateUpRecommTimer attribute can be configured to determine the minimum recommendation time of the bit rate index when the bit rate index increases. This minimum time must be long enough to apply the needed bit rate to keep VoLTE call quality. Depending on the radio conditions and the bit rate recommendation refinement configured with the EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled attribute, the eNodeB can prepare the following recommendations:
    - A lower bit rate index is recommended if the throughput obtained by the UE is lower than the required throughput and if the configured minimum recommendation time passes. If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled attribute is set to true and there is a risk of the UE dropping the call, the lowest bit rate index is recommended.
    - Another bit rate index recommendation is prepared if the throughput obtained by the UE is not lower than the required throughput but the configured minimum recommendation time passes. This can be the previous recommendation or a higher bit rate index if the analysis result is higher than the throughput required by the UE.
    - If the previous recommendation reaches the highest possible bit rate index for the UE, and the analysis results are higher than the required throughput, the recommendation bit rate index value is set to 0. If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled attribute is set to true, the recommendation bit rate index value is set to 9 instead.
4. The UE can also send bit rate recommendation query to the eNodeB. After receiving the query, the recommended bit rate is mapped to the corresponding index value of the controlling parameter.
    - If the received query is for uplink, since optimal bit rate is calculated periodically, the index value prepared for the UE corresponds to the last recommendation.
    - If the received query is for downlink, the index value prepared for the UE is 0, which means the eNodeB does not have any recommendation.
5. The index value is sent to the UE through a MAC control element.Note: The UE adapts the recommended bit rate to codec rate based on the algorithm of the UE.

# 4 Network Impact of VoLTE Rate Recommendation

This feature improves uplink throughput, and introduces new fields to RRC messages and

MAC control elements.

Capacity and Performance

The downlink throughput is expected to be increased because the number of dropped

packets decreases at the cell edge.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState=CXC4012333 attribute to ACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance.
2. Set the bitRateRecommendationEnabled attribute in QCI profile for VoLTE bearer QCI to TRUE.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate VoLTE Rate Recommendation

If this feature is no longer needed, after following the usual deactivation

procedure, the newly introduced MO attribute must be changed, too.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the bitRateRecommendationEnabled attribute in QCI profile for VoLTE bearer QCI to FALSE.
2. Set the FeatureState=CXC4012333 attribute to DEACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 25.Q1.0: Enhanced VoLTE Rate Recommendation

This feature enhancement improves the response time of uplink bit rate index

switching and increases the accuracy of bit rate index recommendations.

| Feature Name           | VoLTE Rate Recommendation   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5014                |
| Value Package Name     | VoLTE Performance           |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0444                |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node         |
| Access Type            | LTE                         |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                    |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Improved response time of uplink bit rate index switching when radio conditions change
- Increased accuracy of bit rate index recommendations based on the uplink radio condition of the UE

Capacity and Performance

The PDCCH CCE Used resource indicator and downlink throughput might be negatively

affected because this feature enhancement requires the eNodeB to send frequent bit

rate index recommendations to the UEs.

This feature enhancement might improve the following KPIs:

- Average UL Packet Loss Rate per QCI
- VoIP Cell Integrity

Operation

The Robust Header Compression feature must be activated by setting the value of the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.rohcEnabled or the

QciProfilePredefined.rohcEnabled attribute to

true before activating the Enhanced VoLTE Rate Recommendation

feature enhancement.

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes for enabling the

refinement of bit rate index recommendations:

- EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteRateRecommEnabled

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes for the configuration of

the recommendation timers:

- EUtranCellFDD.bitRateDownRecommTimer
- EUtranCellTDD.bitRateDownRecommTimer
- EUtranCellFDD.bitRateUpRecommTimer
- EUtranCellTDD.bitRateUpRecommTimer

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters for the observation of

the time distribution of bit rate index switching:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmBitRateDownUlVoipTimeDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmBitRateDownUlVoipTimeDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmBitRateUpUlVoipTimeDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmBitRateUpUlVoipTimeDistr

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
