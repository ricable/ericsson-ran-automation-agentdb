# 1 Multiple Radio Bearers per User Overview

The Multiple Radio Bearers per User feature permits UEs to establish eight simultaneous

data radio bearers.

Summary

Each radio bearer can have a unique QoS profile so that the RBS can apply different

scheduling priorities. This feature provides the base for future traffic separation by the

QoS feature.

To achieve this, bearers are assigned different scheduling priorities depending on the type

of service. For example, delay sensitive data can be assigned a higher scheduling priority

in the RBS compared to non-delay sensitive data such as large FTP file transfers.

The feature enables support for the E-RAB Setup and E-RAB Release procedures in S1-AP

protocol.

Benefits of using the Multiple Radio Bearers per User feature, each service can be mapped

to a bearer with suitable characteristics. Otherwise all services must share the same

non-GBR bearer.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multiple Radio Bearers per User

Multiple Radio Bearers per User introduces the support for a number of 3GPP-defined

procedures related to multiple bearers per user.

Support for Multiple Radio Bearers per User is the minimum support required to provide

service differentiation with the QoS feature.This feature enables the RBS to support

more than one data radio bearer per user. Eight simultaneous data radio bearers per user

are supported.

In a multi DRB connection and a lower prioritized DRB discovers an RLC DL Delivery

Failure, a UE Context Release can be triggered or the higher or equal prioritized DRBs

can be retained. This is controlled by the Rcs.rlcDlDeliveryFailureAction

parameter.

Service allows the assignment of different scheduling priorities per bearer or to assign

different QoS levels in the DSCP of the transport network. Quality of Service provides further details.

Operational Process

The Multiple Radio Bearers per User feature introduces support for the following

procedures defined in 3GPP:

- E-RAB Setup
- E-RAB Release

This feature allows the inclusion of multiple E-RABs in the INITIAL CONTEXT

SETUP procedure and at incoming handover.

Figure 1 shows the communication flow during

E-RAB setup.

Figure 1   E-RAB Setup

E-RAB Setup is triggered by the MME by sending S1-AP message E-RAB SETUP REQUEST.

Request for a maximum of seven E-RABs can be included. One E-RAB always exists,

since the Initial Context Setup procedure must be previously performed.

The RBS allocates the radio and transport network resources for each requested E-RAB.

After successful resource allocation within the RBS, the data radio bearers are

configured in the UE, using the RRC CONNECTION RECONFIGURATION message.

The UE responds with the RRC CONNECTION RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message. The RBS

notifies the MME of the outcome with the S1-AP message E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE.

Figure 2 shows the communication flow during

E-RAB release.

Figure 2   E-RAB Release

E-RAB Release is triggered by the MME by sending S1-AP message E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND.

Request for up to seven E-RABs to be released can be included (one E-RAB must always

remain following the E-RAB release procedure).

The UE is informed of which data radio bearers to release by the RRC CONNECTION

RECONFIGURATION message.

The UE responds with RRC CONNECTION RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

The RBS releases the radio and transport network resources for each E-RAB to be

released. The RBS responds to the MME with E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE.

E-RAB release can also be triggered by the RBS when it receives a GTP-U Error

Indicator message on the S1-U interface.
