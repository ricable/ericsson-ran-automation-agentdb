Summary

The ASGH-Based Prescheduling feature reduces the user plane latency and initial

control plane latency of ASG subscribers compared to normal subscribers.

An ASG is a subset of all RRC connected users in a node that fulfill the triggering

and selection criteria of a specific ASG profile.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Extension of the uplink prescheduling coverage range is not supported for Category M

and NB-IoT.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of ASGH-Based Prescheduling

With the ASGH-Based Prescheduling feature, prescheduling can be turned off or specific

dedicated prescheduling configurations can be applied to ASGs.

Figure 1   Prescheduling Configurations for Advanced Subscriber Group Users

The dedicated prescheduling configuration for a subscriber group is carried in the

PreschedProfile MO. This MO is referenced to the

SubscriberGroupProfile with the

SubscriberGroupProfile.preschedProfileRef attribute.

If the ASGH-Based Prescheduling feature is enabled, the ASG-dedicated prescheduling

configurations are applied according to the

SubscriberGroupProfile.preschedulingMode attribute.

Uplink Prescheduling Coverage Range Control

With the ASGH-Based Prescheduling feature, the operator can extend the uplink

prescheduling coverage range for different subscriber groups. If the operator

extends the uplink prescheduling coverage range, the uplink prescheduling and user

plane latency benefits are available for more ASGH UEs. The

PreschedProfile.preschedulingSinrThreshold attribute

configures the amount of extension. This attribute is used as the uplink SINR

threshold for the corresponding ASGH UEs. Prescheduling grants are only sent, if the

uplink SINR is above this threshold.

The configuration of the

PreschedProfile.preschedulingSinrThreshold attribute has the

following effects:

- Decreasing the value of the attribute extends the uplink prescheduling coverage range. The uplink interference increases with the number of prescheduled UEs. This might lead to performance degradation.
- Increasing the value of the attribute reduces the uplink prescheduling coverage range, which can reduce the uplink interference.

# 4 Network Impact of ASGH-Based Prescheduling

This feature provides performance differentiation for a subset of UEs belonging to an

ASG.

Capacity and Performance

If UEs that belong to a certain subscriber group gain higher performance, other UEs

can have performance reduction. The impact of the feature on the network performance

depends on the following characteristics:

- The degree of difference between the configuration of the UEs in the ASG and the UEs not in the group
- The relative proportion of the UEs in the ASG with differentiated configurations and the UEs not in the group

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of ASGH-Based Prescheduling

The feature has no associated KPIs or events, but it can affect some KPIs. The feature

introduces counters to observe the number of uplink prescheduled UEs.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPI), but has a possible

impact on some KPIs, such as uplink cell throughput. The KPI impact depends on the

following:

- The degree of difference between the configuration of ASG UEs and other UEs
- The relative proportions of the ASG UEs

For more information, see Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexActiveUeUlPresched
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexActiveUeUlPresched

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate ASGH-Based Prescheduling

To use the feature, one ASG profile and the related parameters must be

configured.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- Prerequisite features are activated.
- At least one ASG profile is configured according to ASGH Framework.
- The prescheduling switch under the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO is set to TRUE.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012200 MO instance.

# 8 Deactivate ASGH-Based Prescheduling

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012200 MO instance.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q3: Enhanced Control of Prescheduling Coverage Range

This feature enhancement enables to control uplink prescheduling coverage range for

subscribers in

ASGs.

| Feature Name:           | ASGH-Based Prescheduling        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4797                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0409                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                             |

Benefits

By using this feature enhancement, the operators can control the uplink prescheduling

coverage range that is used for different subscriber groups. By configuring lower

prescheduling uplink SINR threshold, the operator can extend the prescheduling

coverage range. Lower prescheduling uplink SINR threshold for ASGH UEs ensures lower

user plane latency with minor KPI degradation. The operator can decrease the

possible uplink interference by configuring higher uplink SINR threshold higher.

Capacity and Performance

The uplink prescheduling coverage range can be controlled by configuring

prescheduling uplink SINR threshold for ASGH UEs. Uplink prescheduling can provide

user plane latency benefit for ASGH UEs. If the operator extends the uplink

prescheduling coverage range, uplink prescheduling and latency benefit are available

for more ASGH UEs. Uplink interference is increased with the number of prescheduled

UEs. This might lead to performance degradation.

The benefits of the enhancement can be observed through the increase of the

following introduced PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexActiveUeUlPresched
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexActiveUeUlPresched

Operation

The operator can extend the uplink prescheduling coverage range by configuring the

PreschedProfile.preschedulingSinrThreshold attribute. This

attribute can be configured for different subscriber groups. The attribute is used

as the uplink SINR threshold for the corresponding ASGH UEs. Prescheduling grants

are only sent, if the uplink SINR is above this threshold. To extend the uplink

prescheduling coverage range, the value of the attribute has to be decreased. This

feature enhancement is applicable only for the user plane prescheduling.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature enhancement.

The EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexActiveUeUlPresched and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexActiveUeUlPresched counters are available

from ENM version 21.3.
