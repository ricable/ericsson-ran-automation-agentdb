Summary

The RLC in Unacknowledged Mode feature is useful for services that tolerate a packet

loss rate and require lower latency. One

of the most

important

of

these delay-sensitive streaming

services

is VoIP (VoLTE or

PTT).

# 2 Dependencies of RLC in Unacknowledged Mode

This feature applies to the mission-critical bearers as to VoLTE bearers.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

Additional Information

The feature control for both eNodeB and the UE resides in the eNodeB Radio Access

Control layer. The feature realization resides in the eNodeB baseband software.

# 3 Feature Operation of RLC in Unacknowledged Mode

The operation of the feature can be divided to bearer configuration, downlink, and

uplink data transfer.

An RLC entity can be configured to perform data transfer in one of the following three

modes:

- Transparent Mode (TM)
- Acknowledged Mode (AM)
- Unacknowledged Mode (UM)

The eNodeB realization of the RLC UM entity performs both the tasks of the transmitting

RLC UM entity and those of the receiving RLC UM entity. The transmitting RLC UM entity

receives RLC SDUs from the upper layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer receiving RLC UM

entity through lower layers. The receiving RLC UM entity receives RLC PDUs from its peer

transmitting RLC UM entity through lower layers and delivers RLC SDUs to the upper layer

as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Model of Two UM Peer Entities

1. RLC UM Bearer Configuration In one eNodeB, the operator can configure up to three RLC in Unacknowledged Mode feature bearers by setting the QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcMode attribute to UM for each QCI. It is not allowed to modify the RLC mode from an already configured DRB. If the operator changes the RLC mode for a specific QCI, only new DRBs with that QCI are configured with the new mode. For more information regarding the configuration of PDCP SDU, RLC PDU format, and the length of SN, see 3GPP TS 36.322 and 3GPP TS 36.323.
2. Downlink Data Transfer
    1. The downlink data is received from the SGW on the S1 interface.
    2. The downlink is ciphered in the PDCP layer and forwarded to the RLC layer. Downlink transmission is scheduled and the RLC layer performs RLC processing which includes segmentation or concatenation. A MAC PDU is generated and transmitted by a HARQ process to the UE on the DL-SCH.
    3. A HARQ ACK is received from the UE. The UE has correctly decoded the MAC PDU. The UE has correctly used the HARQ grants that are associated with the DL-SCH transmission.
3. Uplink Data Transfer
    1. The eNodeB receives a Scheduling Request (SR) from the UE, requesting uplink resources on PUSCH.
    2. The UE generates a MAC PDU which can contain RLC PDUs from one or more radio bearers and transmits the MAC PDU using a HARQ process on the UL-SCH.
    3. The eNodeB receives and decodes the uplink data. If the data is correctly decoded, the eNodeB transmits a HARQ ACK to the UE for the related HARQ process. The eNodeB extracts any RLC PDUs from the MAC PDU and performs RLC processing which includes reordering and reassembly of the RLC PDUs to create RLC SDUs. The RLC SDUs are forwarded to the PDCP layer which deciphers the data.
    4. The radio bearer data received on DRB is sent to the SGW over the S1 interface.

## 3.1 Handover Behavior

For RLC UM bearers, both RLC and PDCP SN are reset at handover.

At handover, the eNodeB starts sending UM packets with PDCP SN starting from zero in the

target.

The RLC mode of the bearers must not be changed during handover. If the RLC modes for the

bearers are different in the source and the target, the bearers cannot be set up in the

target.

The RLC mode is configured for each QCI by eNodeB. If the source eNodeB has a bearer with

QCI configured with the RLC UM feature and the target eNodeB has mapped the same QCI to

RLC AM, the bearer is rejected.

If the target eNodeB has an invalid RLC in Unacknowledged Mode feature license, handover

can only be performed with RLC AM bearers. The UM bearers are rejected.

# 4 Network Impact of RLC in Unacknowledged Mode

This feature reduces control signaling by omitting ACK messages from the

receiver.
