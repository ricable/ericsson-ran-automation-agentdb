(1)  It is not recommended to configure a standalone NavIC as a

synchronization reference source because of insufficient quality

level.

Depending on the connected GNSS receiver unit, the feature allows for the

configuration of primary wanted and backup satellite system combinations as a

synchronization source on a Baseband Radio Node.

Receiving signals from a satellite system requires a GNSS antenna that supports the

appropriate bands.

Hardware

The feature is supported with the following GNSS receiver units:

- GPS 03
- GRU 04
- GRU 05

The GNSS receiver unit must be connected directly to the node.

The GNSS antenna must support the frequency bands used by the configured satellite

system combinations. For more information on antenna recommendations, see GNSS Receiver System Description.

Limitations

Two RAN Compute units can be connected to the same GNSS receiver unit, but only the

setting from one RAN Compute unit can be applied to a GNSS receiver. The GNSS

receiver unit synchronizes with the GNSS satellite system combination that it is

configured to use and both RAN

Compute

units synchronize with the GNSS receiver unit. Both RAN Compute units use the same

satellite system combination as a synchronization source.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multiple GNSS Support

On

a Baseband Radio Node, the feature can change the satellite system

that is

used

as a synchronization source by setting

the

primary

wanted and the

backup satellite system

combinations

through

the appropriate

attributes.

Multiple GNSS Support on Baseband Radio Node

To change the satellite system

that is

used

as a synchronization source, the

primary

wanted satellite

system

combination must be set

through

the GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted

attribute.

A backup satellite system combination can also be set through the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute. The backup satellite

system combination is used if the primary wanted one has a defect.

For more

information

on the supported

combinations,

see Manage Network Synchronization.

When the combination is applied successfully on the GNSS receiver unit, the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssStatus attribute shows one of the

following values depending on which satellite system combination is configured on

the GNSS receiver unit:

- WANTED\_GNSS\_USED if the satellite system combination is configured through the GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted attribute
- BACKUP\_GNSS\_USED if the satellite system combination is configured through the GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute

If the

feature license is not OPERABLE, the value of the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute is not applicable.

The

feature

license must be OPERABLE unless

the value

of the GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute is set to

NONE and one of the following satellite

systems

is

configured through the GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted

attribute:

- GPS
- Galileo
- GPS and Galileo
- GPS and GLONASS

Otherwise,

the

value of the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssStatus attribute

is

set to

DISABLED\_LICENSE.

In this case, the GNSS receiver

unit

uses the

previously

configured synchronization source.

If the GNSS receiver unit is not

connected

directly to the

RAN

Compute unit or the RAN Compute unit does not control the GNSS receiver

unit, the GNSS receiver unit cannot be configured, and

the

value of the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssStatus attribute

is

set to

GNSS\_REC\_UNREACHABLE.

If the GNSS receiver unit is GPS 01 or GPS 02,

the

value of the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssStatus attribute

is

set to

WANTED\_GNSS\_UNSUPPORTED,

because

these units are not supported by this feature.

The GnssInfo.satelliteInformation attribute

shows

the visible satellites

and

the SNR

of

the signal received from satellites. The

GnssInfo.multipleGnssActual attribute

shows

the satellite systems used by the GNSS receiver unit.

# 4 Network Impact of Multiple GNSS Support

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

# 5 Parameters for Multiple GNSS Support

# 6 Performance of Multiple GNSS Support

This feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

# 7 Activate Multiple GNSS Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

The license key is installed in the node.

CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is

available if something goes wrong.

Node is directly connected to the GNSS receiver.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4040019 MO instance.
2. Optional: Set the GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute to a value other than NONE. This sets a backup satellite system combination, which improves the overall robustness of the synchronization of the node by prolonging the availability of time-dependent services. Note: The possible configuration values for the GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute are the same as for the GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted attribute.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Multiple GNSS Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is

available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4040019 MO instance.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It supports Baseband Radio Node configurations that use a GRU 05 to receive signals from, and use the NavIC satellite system for time synchronization. Operators can configure the GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted attribute for the NavIC satellite system, but the NavIC related configurations are not ready for use in the field.
- It allows operators to distinguish the quality of signals from satellites that are visible by the GNSS Receiver Unit (GRU) on the L1 and L5 bands by updating the GnssInfo.satelliteInformation attribute.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following struct members for the

GnssInfo.satelliteInformation attribute, which represent the

SNR of the L5 band for all supported satellite systems and the BDS B1C signal

respectively:

- signalToNoiseRatioL5
- signalToNoiseRatioB1C

The signalToNoiseRatio struct member is only applicable to the

L1 band.

This feature enhancement updates the GnssInfo.multipleGnssActual

and GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted attributes with the following

options for satellite system combinations:

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports the use of satellite systems that transmit in the

L1 and L5 bands as the default time synchronization source. The default time

synchronization source changes to a combination of

GPS

and

Galileo

satellite systems.

If

the GNSS Receiver does not support this combination, it keeps the

previously

configured

synchronization

source.

The satellites are only used for synchronization when they are

available.

The feature enhancement also removes license control for the following satellite

systems:

- Galileo
- GPS and Galileo

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement changes the default value of the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssWanted attribute from

GPS\_GLONASS to GPS\_GALILEO. If the attribute

is set to a non-default value, the feature enhancement does not change the value of

the attribute.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature

enhancement is applicable for GRUs that support the Galileo satellite

system.

The use of the L5 signal band requires a GRU 05 with a multiband antenna system

connected to the Baseband Radio Node.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports

the

configuration of a backup satellite

system

combination. The node switches to the backup satellite

system

combination if the

primary

wanted satellite

system combination

has

a defect.

Any

satellite

system

combination that can be configured as primary

wanted

can also be configured as backup.

This feature enhancement offers the following benefits:

- Increased robustness
- Prolonged availability of TDD cells

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute.

The feature enhancement adds the following options to the

MultipleGnssStatus

enum:

- GNSS\_BACKUP\_USED
- GNSS\_BACKUP\_UNSUPPORTED

The feature enhancement adds the NONE value to the

SatelliteSystem

enum.

The feature enhancement also

supports

the configuration of the GnssInfo MO in ECT.

To activate the feature enhancement, the

GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute must be set to a

supported satellite system combination. The value must be different from the default

value

of the attribute, which is NONE.

If the feature enhancement is

activated

and a

defect is detected on

the

primary

wanted satellite

system

combination,

the system

performs

the following actions:

1. The node reconfigures the GNSS receiver unit to the backup satellite system combination from the GnssInfo.multipleGnssBackup attribute.
2. The node ensures the quality of the reconfiguration. During this process, the value of the TimeSyncIO.availabilityStatus attribute is set to OFF\_DUTY and the value of the TimeSyncIO.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.
3. Within a few minutes, the GnssInfo.multipleGnssActual attribute displays the satellite system combination used by the GNSS receiver unit.
4. The node changes the value of the GnssInfo.multipleGnssStatus attribute to BACKUP\_GNSS\_USED.
5. The TimeSyncIO.availabilityStatus attribute becomes empty.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is

required

to use ENM version 25.1 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature enhancement.
