# 1 Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control Overview

The feature enables EN-DC-capable cells that are deployed on non-Ericsson nodes to be

considered in the prioritization of EN-DC-capable frequencies for EN-DC-capable UEs at

release.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |

Summary

The Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature prioritizes EN-DC-capable

frequencies for EN-DC-capable UEs at RRC connection release. The prioritization is

based on the number of EN-DC-capable cells on each frequency, including

EN-DC-capable external cells on non-Ericsson nodes.

Hit rate on non-Ericsson EN-DC-capable target cells is also considered in EN-DC-capable

frequency prioritization if any or both of the following features are active:

- Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management
- Cell Sleep Mode

The hit rate-based frequency prioritization allows an EN-DC-capable UE to

select an EN-DC-capable frequency with better coverage probability.

The feature provides the possibility to steer EN-DC-capable UEs to frequencies served by the

nodes of other vendors if the network comprises both Ericsson and non-Ericsson

nodes.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

ENM version 20.1 or later is required for the feature.

The feature is valid for EN-DC-capable UEs that are not Category M1 UEs.

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

The feature enables the consideration of non-Ericsson external cells in the frequency

prioritization for EN-DC-capable UEs.

The Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature

uses the same frequency prioritization method as the Capability-Aware Idle Mode

Capability feature. However, the Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature

provides the way to manually or automatically configure the

ExternalEUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList or the

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute to determine

the EN-DC-capability of a neighbor LTE cell.

For more information, see Capability-Aware Idle Mode

Control.

Operational Process

1. The feature operates if the UE is qualified to be prioritized by the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control or the Basic Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature.
2. If the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute is not empty, the non-Ericsson external cell is considered in the frequency prioritization for the UE. The following table shows how the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList or ExternalEUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute can be populated with PLMN IDs, depending on how the cell is created: Table 2 Created By EN-DC Cell Capabilities Available over X2 MO Configuration Operator Yes Set automatically if EN-DC capability information is received through X2 No Has to be configured manually ANR (The cell must be a permanent cell created by CGI measurement-triggered ANR.) Yes Set automatically if EN-DC capability information is received through X2 No Set automatically with information from EUtranFrequency.extEndcAllowedPlmnListPolicy for the corresponding frequency X2 Yes Set automatically if EN-DC capability information is received through X2 No Set automatically with information from EUtranFrequency.extEndcAllowedPlmnListPolicy for the corresponding frequency EN-DC capability information is only exchanged between Ericsson nodes, but the endcAllowedPlmnList for the automatically created non-Ericsson external cell can be populated by the EUtranFrequency.extEndcAllowedPlmnListPolicy attribute.
3. Either the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management or the Cell Sleep Mode feature must be enabled for the feature to consider target cell coverage probability based on hit rate on the target EN-DC-capable cells. If both features are active, the hit rate calculated by the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature is considered for target cell coverage probability.Note: The target cell must be hit rate capable for this function to operate. This function requires the following MO configurations: The UePolicyOptimization.coverageAwareImc attribute set to true. The following configurations, depending on the activated features: Table 3 Activation of Hit Rate Calculation Depending on Feature License Activated Feature License Attribute Setting Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management The EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy MO attribute is set to any other setting than NOT\_ALLOWED.Note: If the EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy MO attribute is set to NOT\_ALLOWED, hit rate is not calculated on E-UTRAN frequencies. Cell Sleep Mode The EUtranFreqRelation.cellSleepCovCellMeasOn is set to true for the EN-DC-capable frequency. Note: The default values of the attributes allow the feature to calculate hit rate. If cell hit rate-based frequency ranking is applicable, hit rate for the EN-DC-capable non-Ericsson external cells is considered in the aggregated hit rate for EN-DC-capable cells in the frequency. If cell hit rate-based frequency ranking is not applicable, the number of non-Ericsson external cells is considered in the number of all EN-DC-capable cells in the frequency.

# 4 Network Impact of Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

The feature updates the X2 interface and messages.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

The feature adds an X2 proprietary extension to the EAB Served Cell Attribute List

for the following messages:

- X2 Setup Request
- X2 Setup Response
- ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE

This message parameter ensures that the EN-DC-allowed PLMN list is correctly

set by the EUtranFrequency.extEndcAllowedPlmnListPolicy

attribute. This way, UEs can appropriately enter external cells with EN-DC-allowed

PLMN lists.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Inter-Vendor Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

The feature introduces MO attributes to configure the allowed PLMN IDs for external

cells. Also, an attribute is introduced to control if the feature can use target coverage

probability based on hit rate.
