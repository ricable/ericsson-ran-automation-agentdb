# 1 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension Overview

The feature allows enhanced carrier aggregation to be used with up to six component

carriers and 120 MHz bandwidth in downlink.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature provides the capability to transmit data to a UE capable of 3GPP Release

13 or later on six LTE carriers simultaneously, up to a total bandwidth of 120 MHz.

For 6CC carrier aggregation, the PCell must be an FDD cell. Compared to fewer

component carriers, the 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature has the

following benefits:

- More efficient use of the scattered LTE spectrum (FDD, TDD, LAA, and CBRS)
- Higher average and peak downlink UE throughput, subject to UE category limitations

The feature uses reduced band combination signaling for enhanced carrier aggregation

according to 3GPP TS 36.331 and 3GPP TS 36.101. This

enables the UE to inform the eNodeB about relevant band combinations in a smaller

RRC capability information message. This reduces the RRC signaling load.

6CC downlink carrier aggregation is supported in Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation deployments.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

Additional Information

For more information on reduced band combination signaling for enhanced carrier

aggregation, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.101, User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and reception
- 3GPP TS 36.331, Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 4 Network Impact of 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases peak and average downlink UE throughput for 3GPP Release 13 or

later UEs with UE category 20 for downlink even in scattered LTE spectrum, FDD as

PCell in any combination of FDD, TDD, and LAA cells.

At additional SCell configuration during initial connection, connection reestablishment,

or incoming handover, the following impacts apply to UEs configured with carrier

aggregation:

- The number of RRC connection reconfiguration procedures increases when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.
- The size of the RrcConnectionReconfiguration and HandoverPreparationInformation messages and the time to complete the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure might increase when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION or ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION.

Interfaces

The following IEs are used by the feature in the RRC protocol:

- UE-EUTRA-Capability-v1310-IEs
- UE-EUTRA-Capability-v1430-IEs
- RRC Connection Reconfiguration message: RRCConnectionReconfiguration-v1310-IEs: sCellToAddModListExt-r13 sCellToRemoveListExt-r13 CQI-ReportConfig-v1310 cqi-ReportAperiodic-v1310
- Handover Preparation Information message: AS-Config-v1320 sourceSCellConfigList-r13 HandoverPreparationInformation-v920-IEs: Ue-ConfigRelease-r9
- In-Device Coex Indication message: InDeviceCoexIndication-v1310-IEs affectedCarrierFreqCombList-v1310

Other Network Elements

The feature is applicable only for 3GPP Release 13 or later UEs. UEs of earlier

releases are not affected by the feature.

Parameters for Size Reduction of UECapabilityInformation Message

Since the feature is applicable for 3GPP Release 13 and later UEs, the parameters for

Size Reduction of UECapabilityInformation Message in Carrier Aggregation also affect it.

# 6 Performance of 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

KPIs

The feature can be observed with the same KPIs as the Carrier Aggregation

feature.

Counters

The following PM counters are associated with the feature:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActivatedDl6ccSumDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaScheduledDl6ccSumDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDl6ccSCell
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDl6ccPCell

The feature can be observed with PM counters used for any of its prerequisite

features.

Depending on the SCell type, the feature can be observed with PM counters used for

the following features:

- Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD
- Elastic RAN
- Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation
- Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

Events

The feature uses the same events as the Carrier Aggregation feature.

For a full list with detailed information about PM events, see the list files in the

List Files library folder.

# 7 Activate 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- The licenses of the prerequisite features are activated.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012345 MO instance.
2. Set the following MO attributes to the mandatory values: BandCombCompression.requestReducedFormat = ENABLED BandCombCompression.requestedBandCombCompression = R13\_BAND\_COMPRESSION QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcSNLength = 16 QciProfileOperatorDefined.pdcpSNLength = 15
3. Set the following MO attributes to the recommended values to reduce the UECapabilityInformation message size: BandCombCompression.requestSkipFallbackComb = ENABLED BandCombCompression.requestReducedIntNonContComb = ENABLED

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012345 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
