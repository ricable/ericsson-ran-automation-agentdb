# 1 Device-Based Frequency Filtering Overview

The feature enables UE-specific frequency filtering to provide improved compatibility

during carrier aggregation, handover, and mobility configuration.

Summary

UE frequency compatibility is defined for frequency bands. However, certain UEs do

not support certain frequencies in certain bands. These UE limitations can be

mitigated by configuring frequency filtering.

Frequency filtering is based on the UE device type. Filtered frequencies are excluded

from UE configuration messages. This prevents compatibility issues for UEs by

restricting the use of unsupported frequencies.

# 2 Dependencies of Device-Based Frequency Filtering

The Differentiated UE Handling feature must be activated to use this feature. This

feature interacts with other features associated with carrier aggregation, handover, and

mobility.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Masked IMEISV information is required to differentiate UE models. If the masked

IMEISV information is not available, frequency filtering cannot be applied.

Network Requirements

The minimum required version for the network elements are the following:

- ENM version 20.1 or later is required for this feature.
- eNodeB must support 3GPP Release 12.2.0 or higher to handle IMEISV information.
- MME must support 3GPP Release 12.2.0 or higher to handle IMEISV information.

# 3 Feature Operation of Device-Based Frequency Filtering

The feature prevents UE configuration to unsupported frequencies.

The Device-Based Frequency Filtering feature is used to configure a list of unsupported

frequencies for specific UEs, using the

UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList attribute.

Frequency filtering excludes the configured frequencies from eNodeB configuration

messages during the following procedures:

- Blind handover
- Carrier aggregation SCell selection
- Cell reselection
- Mobility measurement configuration
- RRC connection release with redirect

UE types with frequency compatibility issues must be identified, and configured for

differentiated handling. The prerequisite Differentiated UE Handling (FAJ 121 4368)

feature provides the framework for differentiated UE handling. The Masked IMEISV

information is used to distinguish between UE types. For more information, see Differentiated UE Handling.

Frequency filtering is based on EARFCN information. Unsupported EARFCN values must be

configured for each UE type, using the UnsupportedFreqRange struct.

Using the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators (FAJ 121 3054) feature together with the

Device-Based Frequency Filtering feature provides additional control over target cell

selection. If the target cell is operating at least one frequency supported by the UE,

that frequency can be selected as target cell for the UE. Without the Multiple Frequency

Band Indicators feature, only the configured center frequency of the cell is taken into

account. For more information, see Multiple Frequency Band Indicators.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Device-Based Frequency Filtering

## 9.1 Filter Unsupported Frequencies

Unsupported frequencies can be filtered by EARFCN for UE types. UE types and

unsupported frequencies must be configured manually.

Prerequisites

The Differentiated UE Handling feature, and the Device-Based Frequency Filtering

feature are activated.

Steps

1. Configure the IMEISV of the UE type using the ImeisvProfile.listOfTacSvSns attribute. The attribute references the TacSvAndSnRange struct. The struct has the following members: maxSn maxSv minSn minSv tac For more information, see Differentiated UE Handling.
2. Configure the EARFCN value of the unsupported frequency using the UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList attribute. The attribute references the UnsupportedFreqRange struct. The struct has the following members: earfcnDlHigh earfcnDlLow Configuring the same value for both struct members results in filtering one specific EARFCN. If a UE does not support a frequency that overlaps bands, every EARFCN value associated with the unsupported frequency must be configured separately. For example, if a UE supports band 5 and band 26, but does not support 870Mhz, the correct configuration is the following: Table 3 Configuration Example: Filtering a Specific Downlink Frequency in Multiple Bands Attribute Struct Member Value Result UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList[0] earfcnDlLow 2410 870MHz is filtered in band 5. earfcnDlHigh 2410 UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList[1] earfcnDlLow 8800 870MHz is filtered in band 26. earfcnDlHigh 8800 In the following example, a UE supports band 5 and band 26, but does not support the following frequencies: 870MHz 875MHz 880MHz In this case, EARFCN ranges are configured for filtering: Table 4 Configuration Example: Filtering Multiple Downlink Frequencies in Multiple Bands Attribute Struct Member Value Result UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList[0] earfcnDlLow 2410 The following frequencies are filtered in band 5: 870MHz 875MHz 880MHz earfcnDlHigh 2510 UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList[1] earfcnDlLow 8800 The following frequencies are filtered in band 26: 870MHz 875MHz 880MHz earfcnDlHigh 8900 For more information about carrier frequency and EARFCN, see 3GPP TS 36.101.
3. Configure the ImeisvProfile.unsupportedFreqProfileRef attribute to the UnsupportedFreqProfile.unsupportedFreqList attribute.
