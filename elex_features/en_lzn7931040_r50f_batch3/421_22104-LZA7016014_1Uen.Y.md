# 1 Privileged Access Admission Balancing Overview

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature differentiates privileged access

into HPA and Emergency Call privileged access in high-load situations for efficient RBS

system resource management.

Summary

The feature adds enhanced functionality to the Basic Admission Control feature. The

Basic Admission Control feature reserves system resources for privileged access. The

feature also controls the admission of UEs and E-RABs based on whether the resource

request is privileged. Enhanced admission control of privileged access is required

if there is an excess number of privileged access users.

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature classifies privileged access into

the following categories:

- High Priority Access (HPA)
- Emergency call

From an admission control perspective, HPA privileged access has higher

priority than emergency call privileged access. To give priority to HPA privileged

access, the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature reserves a part of the

resources reserved by the Basic Admission Control feature to admit only HPA

privileged access.

System resources controlled by the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature are

the number of RRC connected users and the number of established radio bearers on BBM

level.

The feature manages system resources efficiently when the system is congested by

critical services like public safety.

# 2 Dependencies of Privileged Access Admission Balancing

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature has dependencies with features that

have an impact on load management.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Network requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Privileged Access Admission Balancing

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature enables a separate configuration of

RBS system resources for HPA and emergency call users within the privileged access

pool.

The meaning of privileged access defined by the Basic Admission Control feature is used

in the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature.

For more information, see Basic Admission Control.

Privileged access is classified into the following categories:

- HPA
- Emergency call

HPA privileged access has higher priority than emergency call privileged access. The

Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature reserves a part of the resources reserved

by the Basic Admission Control feature to admit only HPA privileged access UEs and

bearers. This gives priority to HPA privileged access users.

Privileged Access UE Classification

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature uses

establishmentCause to classify a privileged access UE into the

following categories:

- If the establishmentCause of the RRC connection request is highPriorityAccess, the UE has HPA privileged access.
- If the establishmentCause of the RRC connection request is emergency, the UE has emergency call privileged access.

If there is a reestablished or handover UE, that does not have valid

establishmentCause, the Basic Admission Control feature

differentiates privileged access UEs based on the privileged access decision of

radio bearers that belong to the UE as follows:

- If the UE has one or more privileged access bearers, the UE has privileged access.
- Otherwise, the UE has non-privileged access.

This feature classifies the following reestablished or handover privileged access UEs

into categories similarly to the Basic Admission Control feature:

- If the UE has one or more HPA privileged access bearers, the UE has HPA privileged access.
- If the UE has no HPA privileged access bearer, but has one or more emergency call privileged access bearers, the UE has emergency call privileged access.

Figure 1   Privileged Access UE Classification

Privileged Access Bearer Classification

The Basic Admission Control feature differentiates the following privileged access

bearers based on the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level and the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute.

- If the ARP priority level of a bearer is equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute, the bearer has privileged access.
- Otherwise, the bearer has non-privileged access.

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature uses the following attributes to

classify privileged access bearers:

- AdmissionControl.paArpOverride
- AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa
- AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc

If the value of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default

value of -1, calls are identified in the following ways:

- ARP levels higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute are considered emergency calls.
- ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute are considered HPA calls.

If the value of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to a

non-default value, calls are identified in the following ways:

- ARP levels equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute are considered emergency calls.
- ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute, excluding the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute, are considered HPA calls.

It is not recommended to set the values of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa and the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attributes to a value higher

than the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. This is

because HPA privileged access and emergency call privileged access are classified

based on a differentiation by the Basic Admission Control feature. The dependency

rule checks this limitation when the operator sets these attributes.

If an SRB does not have an ARP level, the Basic Admission Control feature

differentiates the following privileged access bearers based on the privileged

access decision of the UE to which the bearer belongs.

- If the UE to which the SRB belongs is a privileged access user, the SRB has privileged access.
- Otherwise, the SRB has non-privileged access.

Similarly to the Basic Admission Control feature, the Privileged Access

Admission Balancing feature classifies privileged access SRBs into the following

categories:

- If the UE to which the SRB belongs is an HPA privileged access user, the SRB has HPA privileged access.
- If the UE to which the SRB belongs is an emergency call privileged access user, the SRB has emergency call privileged access.

## 3.1 Admission Control Based on Privileged Access Categories

The Basic Admission Control feature reserves resources to admit only privileged access

for two system resources. These are the number of RRC connected users (UE resource) and

the number of established radio bearers (bearer resource) on BBM level.

Privileged access is categorized as either HPA or emergency call. HPA privileged access

has higher priority than emergency call privileged access from an admission control

perspective. To give priority to HPA privileged access, the Privileged Access Admission

Balancing feature reserves a part of resource reserved for privileged access by the

Basic Admission Control feature to admit only HPA privileged access.

Figure 3   System Resource Reservation for Admission Control

Figure 4   Admission Control Considering Categories of Privileged Access

Operations described in Figure 4 are

applied when allocating UE resources and bearer resources on BBM level.

With the Basic Admission Control feature, the amount of resources reserved for privileged

access can be configured with the

AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell attribute.

With the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell

attribute of the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature, the amount of resources

reserved for HPA privileged access users can be configured.

A part of the resources reserved for privileged access is used as resources reserved

only for HPA privileged access.

This

means that, the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell attribute

is not recommended to be set to a larger value than the

AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell attribute. This

limitation is checked by the dependency rule when the

operator

sets these attributes.

With the Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access feature, the

AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell attribute is

applicable regardless if the

AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState attribute is set

to ACTIVATED or DEACTIVATED.

Impact on Radio Bearers Admission with Preventive Preemption

From bearer admission control perspective, there are resources reserved for a special

purpose which is known as preventive preemption pool. Preventive preemption pool can

admit only privileged access SRBs in initial context setup. The purpose of the

preventive preemption pool is to give opportunity of preemption by data radio bearer

through temporarily admitting SRBs. This occurs even when there are no free

resources reserved for privileged access bearer.

The Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature impacts the use of preventive

preemption pool, because privileged access SRBs are also classified into two

categories. If the feature is activated, the preventive preemption pool can admit

only HPA privileged access SRBs in initial context setup. This is because HPA

privileged access bearer has higher priority than an emergency call privileged

access bearer.
