# 1 Dynamic QoS Modification Overview

This feature modifies the QoS profile (as defined by 3GPP) for an already established

bearer.

Summary

This feature modifies the QoS profile, which consists of the following QoS parameters:

Operational Process

Figure 1   E-RAB Modification Procedure

The Dynamic QoS Modification feature is activated by the MME using the S1AP E-RAB modification

procedure. Depending on which QoS parameter is to be modified, the feature can involve the UE in

the modification procedure, using the RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure.

The E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message contains the outcome of the modification

request for every E-RAB. If the outcome is not successful, the result also includes a cause

value indicating the reason for the failure.

If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the GBR bearer admission process

is also applied to bearer modification requests. Reject cause messages indicate if the bearer

modify request is rejected because of PTT reservations.

# 7 Activate Dynamic QoS Modification

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011061 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Dynamic QoS Modification

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is

available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011061 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Dynamic QoS Modification

The QCI value affects the E-RAB behavior.

The QCI modification is governed by the following rules to ensure that any undesirable behavior

is avoided:

- The value of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.resourceType or QciProfilePredefined.resourceType attribute must not change from GBR to non-GBR, or from non-GBR to GBR.
- The value of the following attributes must not change:QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcSNLength QciProfilePredefined.rlcSNLength QciProfileOperatorDefined.pdcpSNLength QciProfilePredefined.pdcpSNLength QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcMode QciProfilePredefined.rlcMode
- If the Robust Header Compression feature is OPERABLE and the UE has capabilities for Robust Header Compression, the value of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.rohcEnabled or QciProfilePredefined.rohcEnabled attribute must not change.
- If the Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature is OPERABLE, the value of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.dataFwdPerQciEnabled or QciProfilePredefined.dataFwdPerQciEnabled attribute must not change.
- If the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is OPERABLE, the value of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.serviceType or QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute must not change to and from PTT or MC\_SIGNALING.
- The value of the attribute QciProfileOperatorDefined.aqmMode or QciProfilePredefined.aqmMode must not change.

Inability to comply with the rules governing a QCI modification leads to a modification failure

of the E-RAB, with the S1AP Radio Network Layer Cause IE set to

Not supported QCI Value.
