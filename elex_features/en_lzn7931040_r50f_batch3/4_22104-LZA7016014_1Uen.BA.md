Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The RBS hardware configuration and the site equipment configuration are prepared for 18 cells. For more information, see Radio Node Configurations and Manage Configuration Files.

# 3 Feature Operation of 13-18 Cell Support

The 13-18 Cell Support feature supports configurations of up to 18 cells with one

Baseband 6648 and RAN Processor

6651.

Supported Configurations with Baseband 6648 and RAN Processor

6651

For information on the maximum antenna bandwidth and carrier branches supported with radios

from group 3-4 and 5, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity in the

Radio Node Configurations library.

For information on what group a radio belongs to and a definition of the radio group

concept, see Radio Node Configurations.

Supported Bandwidth Configurations

Single-carrier configurations can be used with any of the available bandwidths between 5

and 20 MHz. For a description of supported configurations and configuration limitations, see

Radio Node Configurations and Antenna and RF Connections.

License Handling

An alarm is raised whenever an operator tries to unlock a cell that is out of the licensed

capacity, that is, when one of the following conditions applies:

- If the 6 Cell Support feature is not activated, an attempt to unlock of the fourth cell raises the Feature Resource Missing alarm. An additional text states that the 6 Cell Support feature must be activated.
- If the 6 Cell Support feature is activated, an attempt to unlock of the seventh cell raises the Feature Resource Missing alarm. An additional text states that the 7-12 Cell Support feature must be activated.
- If the 6 Cell Support and the 7-12 Cell Support features are activated, an attempt to unlock of the 13th cell raises the Feature Resource Missing alarm. An additional text states that the 13-18 Cell Support feature must be activated.
- If the 6 Cell Support, the 7-12 Cell Support, and the 13-18 Cell Support feature are activated, an attempt to unlock the 19th cell raises the Feature Resource Missing alarm. An additional text states that the 19-24 Cell Support feature must be activated.

Removing or deactivating the license in a node takes effect when the cells are locked and

unlocked, or when the node is restarted. This means that enabled cells are not immediately

affected when the license is removed or deactivated.

Baseband R Characteristics

Baseband R503 has the following capabilities:

- Three splitters with one Baseband side CPRI port with 9.8, or 2.5-Gbps line rates and four radio side CPRI ports.
- Radio side CPRI ports have flexible CPRI line rate 9.8 Gbps, 4.9 Gbps, or 2.5 Gbps.
- One radio side CPRI port for each splitter limited at 4.9 Gbps or 2.5 Gbps.
- Per splitter flexible carrier branch mapping between the Baseband and radio side CPRI ports.
- The Baseband must be connected to at least one of side ports 1 or 2. Connection to port 3 only is not supported.

For more information about the Baseband R503 capabilities, see Radio Node Configurations.

Figure 3   Baseband R503 Ports

Figure 4   Baseband R Capabilities

Baseband 6648 and RAN Processor 6651

Configuration

Baseband 6648 and RAN Processor 6651 have the following

capabilities:

- One single Baseband 6648 or RAN Processor 6651 configuration supports up to 18 cells.
- A mix of two, four or eight antennas per cell is supported.
- 960 MHz antenna bandwidth is supported.
- Six frequency bands are supported.
- A mix of carrier bandwidths is supported.
- A mix of FDD and TDD is supported.
- For FDD, up to 72 carrier branches are supported.
- For TDD, up to 96 carrier branches are supported.

This configuration increases the cell throughput and coverage of the eNodeB. The increased

number of cells and increased bandwidth for each eNodeB results in fewer sites being

required.

For information on the maximum antenna bandwidth and sample rate, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and

Massive IoT RAN.

# 4 Network Impact of 13-18 Cell Support

This feature increases the coverage and capacity of the NodeB.

Capacity and Performance

This feature increases eNodeB capacity up to eighteen cells, providing increased coverage

with the possibility to configure up to 18 sectors.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q4: 1560 MHz Antenna Bandwidth Support on Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318 and Baseband 6630

This feature enhancement supports 1560 MHz ABW on Baseband 5216, Baseband 6318 and

Baseband 6630 for TDD and FDD.

With this enhancement, increased ABW of 1560 MHz is available on a single Baseband 5216,

Baseband 6318, and Baseband 6630 for TDD and FDD mode.

The enhancement is valid for FDD and TDD mode, when using 19-24 Cell Support, and for TDD

mode only when using the 7-12 Cell Support, or 13-18 Cell Support features.
