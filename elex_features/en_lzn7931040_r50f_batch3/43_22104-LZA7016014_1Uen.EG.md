Summary

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature supports RRC connection

re-establishment for EN-DC-capable UEs with context established in both LTE RAN and

NR RAN used in an EN-DC deployment. The feature initiates the Secondary Node Release

procedure during RRC connection re-establishment.

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature supports the

re-establishment procedure in cells that are not the serving cell. This includes

cells that belong to another eNodeB and are connected through an X2 interface.

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature supports a basic

inter-vendor re-establishment procedure between cells that belong to Ericsson or

non-Ericsson eNodeBs.

The RRC Connection Re-establishment basic feature makes it possible to reinstate a UE

context with a UE that lost connection to the serving cell.

RRC connection re-establishment is initiated in the UE when it detects any of the

following failures:

- Radio link failure
- Handover failure
- Mobility from E-UTRA failure
- Integrity check failure
- RRC connection reconfiguration failure

For more information, see Radio Bearer Service.

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature has the following

benefits:

- During an ongoing voice call (VoLTE or PTT), the UE connection is improved, and the voice connection is sustained.
- From an eNodeB perspective, the KPIs related to the UE and bearer retainability are improved because the UE stays connected with no abnormal releases.
- Signaling is reduced between the core network and the RAN because the UE is not released and set up again.
- Signaling is reduced between the UE and the RAN because the UE is not released and set up again.
- Less abnormal UE releases occur between different vendor eNodeBs.
- The UE is more likely to stay connected if a re-establishment procedure is triggered between cells controlled by different vendor eNodeBs.
- KPIs related to the UE or to the bearer retainability are improved.
- The RRC connection re-establishment success rate is improved.

Additional Information

For more information and related topics, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.300, Overall description
- 3GPP TS 36.331, Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification

# 2 Dependencies of Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature conflicts with the Shared

LTE RAN feature and the Radio Bearer Service has to be activated first. The Multi-Target RRC

Connection Re-Establishment feature is also related to multiple other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- To get support for any kind of connection re-establishment in an eNodeB, the ENodeBFunction.rrcConnReestActive attribute must be set to true. This is also applicable for basic re-establishment attempts in the serving cell. For more details on the ENodeBFunction.rrcConnReestActive attribute, see Radio Bearer Service.
- When re-establishment involving more than one eNodeB is performed, the two eNodeBs exchange information, when the X2 connection is set up. The retrieve UE context procedure is used towards other vendor eNodeBs while the EAB UE context fetch procedure is used between Ericsson eNodeBs.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment

When RRC connection re-establishment is initiated, the UE selects a target cell. This cell

can be any cell in any eNodeB. The UE sends a

RRCConnectionReestablishmentRequest message to the target cell with the

following identification information:

- CRNTI used in the cell where the failure occurred
- PCI of the cell where the failure occurred
- Message Authentication Code for Integrity (MAC-I)

If the eNodeB of the selected cell finds the context of the UE and can reinstate it, the

eNodeB accepts the re-establishment. The UE reconnects to the RAN. For the additional messages

sent, see Figure 1.

Figure 1   Successful RRC Connection Re-Establishment

If the eNodeB cannot handle the UE re-establishment request, the re-establishment is

rejected. For the additional messages sent, see Figure 2.

Figure 2   Failed RRC Connection Re-Establishment

As described in Radio Bearer Service, the basic eNodeB support for RRC Connection Re-Establishment

only handles re-establishment when the following conditions are met:

- The target cell for re-establishment chosen by the UE is equal to the source cell.
- No RCC procedure is ongoing for the UE in the chosen cell.

In all other cases the eNodeB responds to the UE with an

RRCConnectionReestablishmentReject message.

The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature supports the following additional

cases:

Re-establishment in a different cell:

- Re-establishment in another cell in the serving eNodeB. This cell can be on the same or on a different frequency.
- Re-establishment in a cell of another eNodeB, if there is an X2 connection. This cell can be on the same or on a different frequency.

Data forwarding is supported for RRC Connection Re-establishment, except after transmission

of the handover command, when the re-establishment is initiated during an ongoing handover.

Also, data forwarding is not supported for Re-establishment during RRC Connection

Reconfiguration triggered by RRC Connection Re-establishment.

Re-establishment is supported during the following ongoing procedures:

- Re-establishment during intra-eNodeB handover.
- Re-establishment during X2 handover.
- Re-establishment during SRVCC handover to WCDMA and GERAN.
- Re-establishment during S1 handover (excluding SRVCC), before transmission of the handover command.
- Re-establishment during S1 handover (excluding SRVCC), after transmission of the handover command.
- Re-establishment during RRC connection reconfiguration triggered by TTI Bundling activation or deactivation.
- Re-establishment during RRC connection reconfiguration triggered by measurement configuration, except during initial attach procedure.
- Re-establishment during RRC connection reconfiguration triggered by add, remove, or change of SCell.
- Re-establishment during RRC connection reconfiguration for scheduling resource allocation over PRACH, following Out-of-Sync detection.
- Re-establishment during RRC connection reconfiguration triggered by Transmission Mode change.
- Re-establishment during DL NAS procedure on SRB2.
- Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by E-RAB Setup.
- Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration triggered by RRC Connection Re-establishment (RRE). Note: Re-establishment is not supported during reconfiguration triggered by previous RRE if re-establishment cause is reconfiguration failure and in previous re-establishment attempt full UE reconfiguration was performed.

## 3.1 Re-establishment in a Different Cell

If the eNodeB finds no context for the UE in the re-establishment target cell, it checks to

determine whether the Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature is operable. If the

feature is not operable, the re-establishment request is rejected.

Otherwise, the eNodeB tries to fetch the UE context from all cells with the PCI received in

the RRC Re-establishment Request message from the UE. These cells can be handled as

follows:

- The same eNodeB. For these cells, the context fetch attempt is done with internal eNodeB signaling.
- A different Ericsson eNodeB. For these cells, the context fetch attempt is done with Ericsson-specific X2AP:PRIVATE MESSAGE messages between the eNodeBs.
- A different non-Ericsson eNodeB. For these cells, context retrieve attempt is done with the X2AP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message instead of a context fetch attempt.

Only the cell that has a context for the UE responds.

Figure 3 shows the case when both the original

serving cell and the new target cell reside in the same eNodeB, and the feature is

operable.

Figure 3   RRC Connection Re-establishment in a Cell Handled By the Same eNodeB

Figure 4 shows the case when the original

serving cell and the new target cell reside in different Ericsson eNodeBs, and the feature is

operable. A path switch request is sent to the MME after re-establishment is completed, but

before the UE is reconfigured.

Figure 4   RRC Connection Re-establishment in a Cell Handled By a Different eNodeB

The Context fetch request message can arrive in the serving cell

during an ongoing procedure for the UE. Depending on which procedure is ongoing, the behavior

differs.

If the ongoing procedure is an outgoing intra-eNodeB or X2 handover, the handover is

canceled. The context information is sent back to the re-establishment target cell in the Context fetch response message.

The handover is canceled if the ongoing procedure is an outgoing S1 handover. The context

information is sent back to the re-establishment target cell in the Context fetch response message. In this case, an S1AP:HANDOVER

CANCEL message is also sent to the MME, see Figure 7 and Figure 8.

If the ongoing procedure is different from an outgoing handover, the procedure is canceled if

RRC Connection Reconfiguration is triggered by the following:

- TTI Bundling activation or deactivation
- Non-default measurement configuration
- Add or Remove or Change the SCell
- SR allocation over PRACH following an Out-of-Sync detection, or Transmission Mode change
- Service Specific DRX configuration

If the ongoing procedure is DL NAS Transfer on SRB2, DL NAS Transfer procedure is

canceled.

The context information is sent back to the re-establishment target cell in the Context fetch response message.

Figure 5 shows that a Context

fetch failure message is sent to the re-establishment target cell during one of the

following ongoing procedures:

- RRC connection reconfiguration triggered by ERAB setup, modify, or removal procedures
- RRC connection reconfiguration triggered by intra-cell handover because of reasons other than TTI bundling
- UE capability inquiry
- S1 handover (excluding SRVCC) after transmission of the Handover Command if the serving cell and the re-establishment target cell belong to different eNodeBs
- During the S1 handover execution phase, the target eNodeB sends back Context Fetch Failure message to RRE target eNodeB after the reception of Context Fetch Request.

Figure 5   Context Fetch Failure Message Sent in Ongoing Procedure

Figure 6 shows that a Context fetch response or Context fetch failure message is

not sent to the re-establishment target cell during other ongoing procedures. The target

eNodeB sends a RRCConnectionReestablishmentReject signal to the UE just

before the context fetch timer (t301) expires in the UE.

Figure 6   The Context Fetch Timer Expires in UE During Other Ongoing Procedures

Figure 7 and Figure 8 show a S1AP:HANDOVER CANCEL

message is sent to the MME from the serving cell when a context fetch request arrives during

an ongoing S1 handover. The response message from the MME, S1AP:HANDOVER CANCEL

ACKNOWLEDGE, is handled in the re-establishment target cell. According to 3GPP TS

36.413, the eNodeB is to consider the handover cancellation as successful even if the

S1AP:HANDOVER CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE is not received. In that case, expiry

of the timer ENodeBFunction.tS1HoCancelTimer indicates that the handover

cancellation is considered completed. The purpose of waiting for the S1AP:HANDOVER

CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE, or the ENodeBFunction.tS1HoCancelTimer, is

to guarantee that no new UE procedure and no path switch procedure is initiated towards the

MME until the handover cancellation is completed.

Figure 7   RRC Connection Re-establishment in a Cell Handled By the Same eNodeB, When S1 Handover

Is Ongoing in the Serving Cell

Figure 8   RRC Connection Re-establishment during SRVCC Handover and S1 Handover in a Cell Handled

by an eNodeB other than the eNodeB handling the Serving Cell

A serving cell immediately rejects an incoming context fetch request by sending a context

fetch failure message in the following cases:

The MOM attribute ENodeBFunction.mtRreWithoutNeighborActive is

FALSE and at least one of the following criteria is true:

- An EUtranCellRelation does not exist to the re-establishment target cell
- The attribute EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed is FALSE.
- The target Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) cannot be matched in attribute ExternalEUtranCellFDD.activePlmnList or ExternalEUtranCellTDD.activePlmnList of the serving cell.

For more configuration information, see Shared

LTE RAN.

## 3.2 Re-establishment in Target Cell During X2 Handover

The RRC connection re-establishment procedure is supported in the target cell during X2

handover when the UE is tuned to the target cell, and the Path Switch procedure is not

finished.

RRE Support in Handover Target Cell Before Path Switch Request is Sent

The behavior of the RRE target node differs from the previous versions in two cases.

The cases when the behavior is different are detected with information elements in

the Context Fetch Response message according to the following scenarios:

- When the Context Fetch Request is initiated by handover source eNodeB, then the handover target includes the Previous eNB UE X2AP ID information element into the response. The RRE target uses this information to find the UE context and avoid Path Switch procedure.
- When the Context Fetch Request is initiated by the cell on the same eNodeB, then the handover target includes Ongoing Procedure information element into the response and sets it to incomingX2Handover. The RRE target uses this information as indication to perform the Path Switch procedure.

RRE Support in Handover Target Cell After Path Switch Request is Sent

If the handover target eNodeB receives Context Fetch Request message when the Path

Switch procedure is started, it queues the message and waits for Path Switch Request

Acknowledge from the MME. If the Path Switch Request Ack message contained E-RAB To

Be Released List information element, then the corresponding information is included

in the response. The RRE target uses information from the response during

reconfiguration of the UE.

## 3.3 Feature Operation in the UEs

From a UE point of view, the flow of a re-establishment procedure is always the same. The UE

is re-established in the same way when the eNodeB is using the basic re-establishment feature,

the Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature, even in case of inter-vendor eNodeB

scenarios. The eNodeB uses the Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature, for

example when a UE re-establishment is attempted during an ongoing handover.

For more details on the flow of re-establishment from an UE, see Radio Bearer Service.

## 3.4 Re-establishment for UEs with EN-DC Established

The RRC connection re-establishment procedure is supported for UEs with EN-DC

established. When RRC re-establishment is completed, PDCP is relocated to the

re-establishment target LTE cell for the following bearer types:

- Master Node terminated MCG bearer
- Secondary Node terminated Split bearer
- Secondary Node terminated MCG bearer

After the RRC re-establishment is completed, the Secondary Node is released from

the source LTE cell. B1 measurement based setup is always initiated after

re-establishment, except when TTI bundling is active. The LTE RRC Re-establishment

feature always initiates the B1 measurement-based setup after re-establishment, even

when configuration-based setup of SCG radio resources is configured in the

re-establishment target cell. If there is no need to set up EN-DC, then the B1

measurement-based setup process must be canceled. All DRBs are set up as Master Node

terminated MCG bearers in the re-establishment target LTE cell.

For a scenario where RRC connection re-establishment is initiated for a UE with EN-DC

established, see Figure 9. For a cell handled by

a different eNodeB, a path switch request is sent to the MME after re-establishment is

completed, but before the UE is reconfigured. For a cell handled by the same eNodeB, an

ERAB modification indication is sent to the MME instead of a path switch request.

## 3.5 Inter-vendor Re-establishment between Ericsson and non-Ericsson eNodeBs

RRC connection re-establishment is provided in a cell different than the serving cell

and belonging to a different vendor eNodeB.

The Basic Inter-vendor RRC Connection Re-establishment configuration is supported for UEs

with certain ongoing UE procedures in the serving cell.

Figure 10   Basic Inter-vendor RRC Connection Re-establishment Configuration

The Retrieve UE Context procedure is sent to other vendor eNodeBs, while the EAB UE

Context Fetch procedure is used between Ericsson eNodeBs:

1. The UE attempts RRC Connection Re-establishment in an unprepared cell.
2. The target Ericsson eNodeB retrieves the UE context from the source eNodeB operated by a different vendor by sending the RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message. The ongoing UE procedure is ended to release the allocated resources. The source eNodeB sends back the context information to the target eNodeB in the Retrieve UE Context Response message. Figure 10 shows the execution of the the Retrieve UE Context procedure.
3. The Re-establishment timer is started if the following options are fulfilled: The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment feature is activated. Both the target and the source enodeBs support MFBI or FBIP.

The execution of the Retrieve UE Context procedure is supported during the following

ongoing UE procedures:

- Outgoing X2 Handover
- Outgoing Intra-eNodeB Handover
- SCell Reconfiguration
- Measurement Reconfiguration
- RRC ReconfigurationNote: The execution of the Retrieve UE Context procedure is only supported after incoming X2 Handover.
- CGI Measurement
- UE Capability EnquiryNote: The execution of the Retrieve UE Context procedure is not supported during Initial Context Setup.

For other procedures, the Retrieve UE Context procedure to the target cell is rejected

with the Retrieve UE Context Failure message.

Sending the DATA FORWARDING ADDRESS INDICATION message is optional. The

target Ericsson eNodeB can provide a data forwarding address for each re-established

E-RAB to the source eNodeB operated by a different vendor.

The reception of the SN STATUS TRANSFER message is optional. It depends on

whether at least one DRB is configured in the RLC AM of the source eNodeB.

The target eNodeB expects reception of the SN STATUS TRANSFER message

until the tRrcConnReest timer expires. The re-establishment sequence

does not continue until the SN STATUS TRANSFER message is received or

until the timer expires. When the timer expires, the UE signaling connection is released

by the target eNodeB.

Inter-vendor Re-establishment for UEs with EN-DC Established

The inter-vendor RRC connection re-establishment configuration is supported for

EN-DC-configured UEs when no procedure is ongoing, or when one of the following

supported RAN procedures is ongoing:

- Outgoing X2 Handover
- Outgoing Intra-eNodeB Handover
- SCell Reconfiguration
- Measurement Reconfiguration
- RRC Reconfiguration
- CGI Measurement
- UE Capability Enquiry

The execution of the Inter-Vendor RRC Connection Re-establishment Procedure is not

supported during Initial Context Setup. The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is only

supported after an incoming X2 Handover.

Figure 11   EN-DC Support for Inter-Vendor Multi-Target RRC Connection

Re-establishment Procedure

If an Ericsson eNodeB acts as the source eNodeB, the Inter-Vendor Multi-Target RRC

Connection Re-establishment procedure is performed with the following sequence:

1. The source eNodeB receives the X2 RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message and identifies the corresponding UE context, in which EN-DC is configured.
2. Optional: The ongoing UE procedure is aborted to release the allocated resources.
3. The source eNodeB finds the UE context, then prepares and sends the X2 RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE message.
4. The source eNodeB sends the X2 SGNB RELEASE REQUEST message to the secondary gNodeB and requests the release of the NR resources.
5. The source eNodeB receives the X2 SGNB RELEASE REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message from the secondary gNodeB.
6. The source eNodeB receives the X2 UE CONTEXT RELEASE message from the target eNodeB and releases the UE context.
7. The source eNodeB sends the X2 UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to the secondary gNodeB and releases the UE context.

# 6 Performance of Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment

Existing KPIs are expected to be affected when support for UE Connection Re-

Establishment is offered in different handover situations and in re-establishment target

cells.

KPIs

The retainability KPI is improved because several abnormal UE releases can be

avoided. It is also assumed that releases also decrease as a consequence when

bearers have data in buffers.

The numerical values of the accessibility KPIs can be slightly decreased to support

for re-establishment. Compared with the situation where re-establishment in a cell

is not supported, and the UE attempts connection establishment instead. The

nominator and denominator of the fraction in the accessibility KPI formula are

decreased with the same value. This leads to a decrease in the fraction value.

The table lists the main PIs associated with the feature, and their formula.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q3: Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment Enhancements

Enhances Multi-target Connection Re-establishment feature, supporting RRC Connection Re-establishment in cells.

| Feature Name:           | Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3023 R3                                |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE Performance                              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0444 R4                                |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                            |

This improvement enhances Multi-target Connection Re-establishment feature.

It supports RRC Connection Re-establishment in a cell which belongs to a different eNodeB

than the serving cell during SRVCC Handover and S1 Handover (before transmission of the

Handover Command).

It is accomplished by requesting Handover Cancel procedure from the source eNodeB and

Path Switch procedure from the target eNodeB when it has a confirmation that there is no

handover procedure ongoing in MME.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This functionality requires no action from the operator.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 18.Q3: Support for RRC Connection Re-Establishment in Target eNodeB During Handover Execution

The enhancement introduces support for RRC Connection Re-establishment in the target

eNodeB during handover execution, after the UE is tuned to the target cell and until the

Path Switch is completed. It also defines new formulas to show a gain of the

re-establishment

features.

| Feature Name:           | Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3023 R4                                |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE Performance                              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0444 R5                                |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                            |

Definition of the following new PI formulas is introduced that reflect a network quality

and show benefits of RRC Connection Re-establishment and Multi-Target RRC Connection

Re-establishment features:

- Drop Avoidance Rate by RRC Connection Re-establishment (DAR)
- UE Contexts Fetched Over Time (CSF)

The

enhancement

has the benefit of reduced end user service interruption, especially for a UE that

performs X2 handover. For UE that performs S1 handover, it shortens the time of

rejection of RCC Connection Re-establishment Request.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The enhancement has the following impact on the existing KPIs:

- Improvement in the RRC Connection Re-establishment Success Rate
- Improvement in the UE Context Fetch Success Rate
- Moderate improvement in the Retainability KPIs (depending on the occurrence of the scenarios covered by the enhancements in the operator network)

The enhancement introduces the following new PM Counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchSuccErabActQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchSuccErabActQci
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttX2HoIn
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttX2HoIn
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchSuccX2HoIn
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchSuccX2HoIn
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttIntraEnbHoIn
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttIntraEnbHoIn
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchSuccIntraEnbHoIn
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtFetchSuccIntraEnbHoIn

Interfaces

The enhancement affects the following interfaces:

- X2 interface, Ericsson X2AP Private Extension The new optional Previous eNB UE X2AP ID information element is introduced in the EAB UE Context Fetch Response message. The new incomingX2Handover value is introduced for existing information element EAB Ongoing Procedure.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.c: 18.Q4: Extended Observability for Re-establishment Attempts during RRC Connection Reconfiguration

The enhancement introduces five new pm counters related to re-establishment attempts

## Appendix A.d: 19.Q2: Support for RRC Connection Re-establishment during RRC Connection Reconfiguration

The enhancement introduces new supported procedures for the Multi-Target RRC

Connection Re-establishment feature.

| Feature Name:           | Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-Establishment   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3023                                   |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                            |

The enhancement improves the Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature by

introducing support for RRC Connection Re-establishment during RRC Connection

Reconfiguration initiated by the following procedures:

- E-RAB Setup
- RRC Connection Reestablishment

Reject cause in E-RAB Setup response for intra-eNodeB reestablishment must be configured using the ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary52 configuration parameter:

| For Ericsson MME     |    | The Interaction with other procedure is to be used. Set the value of the ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary52 parameter other than 1 (the default value is -2000000000).   |
|----------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                      |    |                                                                                                                                                                     |
| For non-Ericsson MME |    | The X2 Handover triggered is to be used. Set the ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary52 parameter to 1.                                                                      |

To avoid a loop of re-establishment attempts during RRC connection reconfiguration

initiated by the previous RRC connection re-establishment procedure, the source eNodeB

rejects re-establishment, if the cause is reconfiguration failure and in previous

re-establishment attempt full UE reconfiguration was performed.

The enhancement also improves observability of re-establishment attempts performed during

RRC connection reconfiguration. This is done by facilitating detection of situations

when Context Fetch Request is received during RRC

connection reconfiguration triggered by Initial Context Setup procedure

and the reason for re-establishment is reconfiguration failure.

The following limitations apply for the enhancement:

- Re-establishment during reconfiguration initiated by E-RAB Setup is not supported for UEs, that do not support full reconfiguration.
- Packet forwarding is not supported during re-establishment that is initiated during reconfiguration, triggered by previous re-establishment procedure.
- Re-establishment during reconfiguration initiated by previous reestablishment is not supported, if reestablishment cause is reconfigurationFailure and the UE does not support full reconfiguration.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- pmUeCtxtFetchSuccReconfErabEstab
- pmUeCtxtFetchSuccReconfRrcConnReest

| Access Type:            | LTE                                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement improves the Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment

feature. It enables the execution of the 3GPP-defined Retrieve UE Context procedure

while another UE procedure is ongoing in the source eNodeB.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits in inter-vendor network

deployments:

- End-user service interruption time is reduced. Fewer abnormal UE releases occur during the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure in inter-vendor scenarios.
- Score on the VoLTE performance benchmark is improved, as the ability of the UE to stay connected is improved.
- Retainability KPIs are improved.

Capacity and Performance

KPIs related to retainability between UE and bearer are improved.

The performance of the enhancement can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRetrReestAtt
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRetrReestAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRetrReestSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRetrReestSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRetrReestFailOngUeProc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRetrReestFailOngUeProc

Operation

When the source eNodeB receives the UE context retrieval request from the target

eNodeB, the ongoing UE procedure is gracefully terminated. All previously allocated

resources are released, and the inter-vendor Retrieve UE Context procedure is

executed.

The following PM counters are updated by extending stepping conditions to include the

inter-vendor RRC connection re-establishment scenario:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtFetchAttX2HoPrep

| Access Type:            | LTE                                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables the execution of the 3GPP-defined Retrieve UE Context

procedure for EN-DC configured UEs in non-Ericsson eNodeBs and improves the

Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Fewer abnormal UE releases during the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure between eNodeBs belonging to different vendors. EN-DC-configured UEs are more likely to stay connected, and as a result, KPIs related to retainability between the UE and the bearer are improved.
- Inter-vendor RRC Connection Re-establishment procedures triggered for EN-DC-connected UEs are supported. As a result, the RRC Connection Re-establishment Success Rate KPI is improved.
- When the UE is EN-DC capable and the NR leg is activated, end-user service interruption time for EN-DC configured UEs is reduced.

Inter-Vendor Multi-Target RRC Re-establishment is not supported when the NR leg is

being set up, modified, or released.
