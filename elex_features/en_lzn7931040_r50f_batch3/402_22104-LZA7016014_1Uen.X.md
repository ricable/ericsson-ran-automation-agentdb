Summary

IDC is the ability to host multiple radio transceivers in the same UE in a way that

prevents interference between those transceivers. When the UE informs the eNodeB

that it experiences radio interference, the eNodeB prevents carrier aggregation from

using SCells on problematic frequencies.

UEs use the following RRC IEs:

- The inDeviceCoexInd-UL-CA-r11 IE is used to declare the UE capability of reporting IDC indications addressing the interference for uplink carrier aggregation.
- The VictimSystemType-r11 and the AffectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 IEs are used to report the detected interference problems.

The eNodeB remedies the interference problem by disabling inter-band and

intra-band uplink grants for the reported problematic frequencies.

Figure 1   IDC for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

This feature has the following benefits:

- UEs experience reduced uplink radio interference from SCells during uplink carrier aggregation.
- UE malfunction caused by radio interference is prevented between transceivers in live networks. This can happen when the UE uses carrier aggregation to carry uplink data.
- Multiple uplink carrier aggregation transmissions do not cause interference in other UE components like GNSS. The Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature can remain activated.

# 3 Feature Operation of IDC for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

Operational Process

1. A UE that supports IDC functionality indicates related UE capabilities to the eNodeB through IE inDeviceCoexInd-UL-CA-r11.
2. The eNodeB can configure Uplink Carrier Aggregation related IDC capable UEs to provide IDC indications in order to initiate transmission of the InDeviceCoexIndication message through IE idc-Config.
3. The UE reports its IDC issues to the eNodeB using the RRC message InDeviceCoexIndication with the following IEs: Information Element Implementation Rules and Limitations victimSystemType-r11 Provides detailed victim system related control input to the feature IDC for Uplink Carrier Aggregation. gps-r11 Turns on handling for GPS related IDC if set to TRUE. Turns off handling for GPS related IDC if there is no value associated. glonass-r11 Turns on handling for GLONASS related IDC if set to TRUE. Turns off handling for GLONASS related IDC if there is no value associated. bds-r11 Turns on handling for BDS related IDC if set to TRUE. Turns off handling for BDS related IDC if there is no value associated. galileo-r11 Turns on handling for Galileo related IDC if set to TRUE. Turns off handling for Galileo related IDC if there is no value associated. wlan-r11 Turns on handling for WLAN related IDC if set to TRUE. Turns off handling for WLAN related IDC if there is no value associated. Presence of IE affectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 is also required. bluetooth-r11 Turns on handling for Bluetooth related IDC if set to TRUE. Turns off handling for Bluetooth related IDC if there is no value associated. Presence of IE affectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 is also required. affectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 Lists frequency combinations which can cause IDC issues for the reporting UE if present.
4. The UE that has IDC problems does not receive uplink grants from the eNodeB on the affected SCells. If the IE AffectedCarrierFreqCombList-r11 is included in the IDC indication, then uplink grants are disabled on SCells with the least anticipated impact on uplink throughput. For victim systems referenced by the IE VictimSystemType-r11, uplink grants are disabled on SCells with bands causing interference on frequencies used by the victim systems. If a previously received IDC indication identified a selected SCell as a cell that impacts IDC, then uplink grants are disabled when the SCell selection is made. If an SCell is already configured, and it is known to be a cell that impacts IDC because of a received IDC indication, then uplink grants are disabled as a result. The UE receives the uplink grants again from the eNodeB on the SCells once it is free from IDC issues. For this to happen, the UE must send a new InDeviceCoexIndication, where the information which originally triggered the disabling of the uplink grants are now removed. This can happen if the user turns off GPS on the UE.

Handover

When initiating a handover, the source eNodeB sends the required IEs in IE

HandoverPreparationInformation. The target eNodeB uses the

IDC parameters that it received from the source eNodeBs over S1AP or X2AP.

# 4 Network Impact of IDC for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

This feature has impact on IDC-capable UEs.

Capacity and Performance

When the UE

sends an IDC

indication

by the dedicated RRC signalling to the eNodeB, and

the

eNodeB disables uplink grants on one or several carriers for the

affected UE, then

the

uplink

capacity of

the UE is reduced.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

Other Network Elements

UE must support Carrier Aggregation as specified in 3GPP Release 10 and it must also

be IDC-capable.

# 5 Parameters for IDC for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

IDC for Uplink Carrier Aggregation introduces no new parameters and affects no legacy

parameters. Three parameters connected to SCell selection, the channel number for the

central downlink frequency, and the uplink channel bandwidth in the cell can affect the

feature.
