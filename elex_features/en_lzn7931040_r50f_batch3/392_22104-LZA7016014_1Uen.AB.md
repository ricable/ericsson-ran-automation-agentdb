# 1 Robust SRVCC Handover at Call Setup Overview

The feature introduces the possibility to delay the SRVCC handover to ensure a VoLTE

call can be successfully set up before transferring it to GSM or WCDMA.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4855                                 |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE                                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0443                                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license for each node. |

Summary

In the LTE radio coverage, the data coverage area is larger than the voice coverage

area. VoLTE calls in weak coverage on cell edges can trigger the SRVCC handover to

GSM or WCDMA immediately at setup.

When the SRVCC handover at call setup in pre-alerting phase is not supported, the

feature provides the eNodeB with robust SRVCC handover at call setup. This means the

eNodeB delays the IRAT handover to GSM or WCDMA in the pre-alerting phase and

triggers it only after the SIP 180 (Ringing) response. The delay ensures that VoLTE

calls can successfully be set up and transferred to GSM or WCDMA.

Activating the feature is not needed

in a network where an Ericsson MSC is used with the Robust SRVCC feature activated.

# 3 Feature Operation of Robust SRVCC Handover at Call Setup

The feature delays the SRVCC handover at call setup. The duration of the delay is

configurable through a timer.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Process Steps

1. The eNodeB checks the Bearer Setup Response S1 message to confirm the QCI 1 is set up successfully in the current bearer setup.
2. If the QCI 1 is set up successfully and the EUtranCellFDD.srvccDelayTimer or the EUtranCellTDD.srvccDelayTimer attribute is greater than 0, the eNodeB starts a delay timer for the UE.
3. An incoming B2 measurement report can trigger the SRVCC handover to GSM or WCDMA. If the eNodeB receives the report when the delay timer is running, the eNodeB does not trigger the handover preparation process. Instead, the eNodeB caches the handover preparation process. If another handover preparation is already cached, the eNodeB replaces it with the new one.
4. If the SRVCC handover preparation to GSM or WCDMA is cached and the delay timer is running, the following events can affect the operation:
    1. The eNodeB receives a measurement report again. The following cases can happen:
        - The eNodeB receives a B2 measurement report that can trigger the SRVCC handover to GSM or WCDMA. The eNodeB does not trigger the handover preparation process, but caches it, and replaces the already cached handover process.
        - The eNodeB receives an A1 measurement report about the UE being in good coverage. The eNodeB discards the SRVCC handover preparation to GSM or WCDMA and stops the delay timer.
        - The eNodeB receives an A3 or A5 measurement report that triggers LTE IRAT handover or RwR. The eNodeB discards the SRVCC handover preparation to GSM or WCDMA and stops the delay timer.
    2. The QCI 1 or UE context is released. In these cases, the eNodeB discards the cached SRVCC handover preparation to GSM or WCDMA and stops the delay timer.
5. When the timer expires and the SRVCC handover preparation to GSM or WCDMA is cached, the eNodeB triggers the handover preparation.

# 7 Activate Robust SRVCC Handover at Call Setup

To use the feature, it must be first activated following the usual feature activation

procedure and setting the EUtranCellFDD.srvccDelayTimer or the

EUtranCellTDD.srvccDelayTimer attribute.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.
- Depending on the handover target RAT, the SRVCC Handover to GERAN feature or the SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature must be active.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012240 MO instance.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.srvccDelayTimer or the EUtranCellTDD.srvccDelayTimer attribute to greater than 0.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Robust SRVCC Handover at Call Setup

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is

available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012240 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Robust SRVCC Handover at Call Setup

The timer determining the duration of the SRVCC handover delay can be configured by

the operator. It is important to set this timer appropriately to optimize the feature

benefits.

This feature is not recommended to be used with high speed UEs.

The EUtranCellFDD.srvccDelayTimer or

EUtranCellTDD.srvccDelayTimer attribute must be set to be greater

than 0 for the feature to operate. This attribute determines how long the feature delays

the SRVCC handover. Therefore, it is important to set this timer appropriately.

If the delay is set to be too long, there is no time to finish the handover before the

call drops at the edge of the coverage area. If it is too short, the handover starts

during the pre-alerting phase and the VoLTE call drops. Because of this, the shortest

recommended value for the delay timer is the time between the QCI 1 E-RAB setup and the

SIP 180 (Ringing) response. The recommended value of this attribute in typical

conditions is 6000 ms. In different conditions, appropriate values can be determined by

tuning.
