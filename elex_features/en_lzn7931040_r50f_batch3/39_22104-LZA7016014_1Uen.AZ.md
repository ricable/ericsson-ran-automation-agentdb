# 1 Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover Overview

The purpose of the Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover feature is to reduce downlink packet

loss during an S1 handover. The feature ensures that data buffered in the source eNodeB is

not lost and the data rates remain high following an S1 handover.

Summary

A short interruption occurs in the service during the handover between the source and target

eNodeBs. The Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover feature allows reducing this

interruption time the end user experiences during the S1 handover process. This is

particularly required by delay-sensitive applications, such as the VoIP.

# 3 Feature Operation of Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover

When the source eNodeB initiates an S1 handover, it chooses between indirect and direct

packet forwarding. The method of packet forwarding depends on the availability of a direct

path indicated by the source eNodeB.

Process Steps

1. The source eNodeB initiates data forwarding and indicates if a direct path is available. This can be overridden by the MME or the target eNodeB.
2. Depending on the override of the MME or the target eNodeB, the initiated data forwarding can be the following: Direct Indirect Data forwarding not possible Table 2 Possible Methods of Packet ForwardingMethod of Packet Forwarding Direct Path Availability Indicated by Source Node Packet Forwarding Supported by Target Node Indirect Packet Forwarding Supported by the MME Action Direct Yes Yes N/A The target eNodeB sends the IP address and GTP-U TEID for each admitted bearer to be used for packet forwarding back to the source eNodeB. Indirect No Yes Yes The MME sends the IP address and GTP-U TEID it received from the SGW to the source eNodeB for packet forwarding. Data forwarding not possible No No No The MME indicates to the target eNodeB for each bearer that data forwarding is not possible. The target eNodeB does not send the IP address and GTP-U TEID for packet forwarding.
3. The source eNodeB forwards the packets to the target eNodeB if it receives the packet forwarding IP address and the GTP-U TEID without indication of the packet forwarding being direct or indirect.

## 3.1 S1 Handover Preference

The S1 handover is used when the X2 handover is not possible and when the handover occurs between nodes belonging to different MMEs. However, S1 handover can also be used between eNodeBs that belong to the same MME in the following scenarios:

- No X2 interface exists between the source and the target eNodeBs.
- No X2 control plane interface exists for signaling although IP connectivity exists between the source and the target eNodeBs.
- Temporary X2 control plane interface failure.

## 3.2 Methods of Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover Initiation

The following methods of packet forwarding are available when the source eNodeB initiates an S1 handover:

| Direct Packet Forwarding   |    | Data is transferred over the X2 user plane between the source and the target eNodeBs. The source eNodeB indicates to the MME that a direct path is available in the S1AP control signaling.                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Indirect Packet Forwarding |    | Data is transferred over the S1 user plane through the source or target SGWs between the source and the target eNodeBs. When no direct user plane path exists, the source eNodeB does not indicate that a direct path is available in the S1AP control signaling. This results in indirect packet forwarding. |

# 4 Network Impact of Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover

This feature affects the performance by enabling to have maximum network capacity during

S1 handover.

Capacity and Performance

The Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover feature ensures that the network capacity is maximized by

minimizing downlink packet loss during S1 handover. It also ensures that the data

rates remain high following an S1 handover.

Interfaces

If a direct path exists between the source and the target, the packet is forwarded on the X2 user plane. However, if no such path exists, the data is forwarded on the S1 user plane using the source and target SGW.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.
