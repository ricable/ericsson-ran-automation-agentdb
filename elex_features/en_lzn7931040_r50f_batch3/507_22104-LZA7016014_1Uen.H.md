# 1 Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access Overview

The feature introduces a third threshold within the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature. Above this threshold, all UE requests, including Privileged Access (PA)

requests are immediately rejected or queued.

Summary

By activating the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

feature, PA is also considered when the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature

compares the total load against the introduced third threshold. If the total load is

above the third threshold, all admission requests, including PA user requests, are

immediately rejected or queued instead. After a period, the queued requests can be

admitted or rejected depending on the availability of system resources.

The Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature has the

following benefits:

- Increased retainability KPIs during overloaded situations
- Increased integrity KPIs during overloaded situations
- Reduced risk that admitted PA UEs cannot be properly served according to the QCI parameters (minimum bit rate, maximum waiting time, delay) because of overload

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

This feature enables the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature to reject immediately or

queue Privileged Access (PA) user requests for a period in case of

overload.

Operational Process

Without this feature, the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature always admits PA user

requests.

If the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is

activated, a third threshold is added within the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature. Using the two features together, the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature

rejects PA users also, if the total MSR load exceeds the third threshold.

PA user requests about to be rejected due to overload are queued instead for a period

if the two features are activated together with the Prioritized Call Queuing at High

Load feature.

## 3.1 Thresholds for Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

If the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated,

three different thresholds are defined for each MSR group. When a UE attempts to connect

to the node, the filtered MSRs are compared to these three thresholds. The result of

this comparison determines whether the cell is considered to be overloaded or not. When

any of the filtered MSRs is above a corresponding threshold, specific UE access requests

are immediately rejected or queued instead. After a period, the queued requests can be

admitted or rejected depending on the availability of system resources. If the Enhanced

PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the downlink PTT dynamic MSR reservation is

also compared to the three different thresholds beside the filtered MSRs. The total load

is compared to the following thresholds:

Table 2   Thresholds to the Total Load Is Compared

| Thresholds  (1)             | Accepted UE Access Requests above the Threshold                      | Queued or Rejected UE Access Requests above the Threshold                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| xxDynUeAdmCtrlRetDiffThr    | Reestablishment and handover     Privileged Access (PA) request  (2) | RRC Connection Request                                                      |
| xxDynUeAdmCtrlOverloadThr   | PA request                                                           | RRC Connection Request     Reestablishment and handover  (3)                |
| xxDynUeAdmCtrlPaOverloadThr | No accepted UE access request                                        | RRC Connection Request     Reestablishment and handover     PA request  (4) |

(1)

The first two characters xx of the threshold

parameter names mean downlink, uplink, or CCE MSR group.

(2)

The following types of requests are considered

to be PA:

- RRC connection requests with emergency or high priority access establishment causes.
- For handover requests and RRC connection reestablishment requests, where any of the E-RABs has an Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level value equal to or below that of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute.
- With the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature activated, the mobile-terminating access requests with paging priority higher than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This threshold is configured by the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute.

(3)

Call queuing function is not available for

handover requests and RRC connection

reestablishment requests.

(4)

Call queuing function is not available for

handover requests and RRC connection

reestablishment requests.

Figure 1 shows the admission policy with three

admission thresholds. The first two characters xx of the threshold

parameter names refer to downlink, uplink, or the CCE MSR group.

Figure 1   Admission Policy

## 3.2 Mobile Terminating Access Handling with Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

When the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is

activated, the privileged mobile-terminating access requests can be rejected during high

load.

When the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature is activated, the

mobile-terminating access requests with a paging priority that is equal to or higher

than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This

threshold is configured with the

EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute. If the

Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated and the

load in the cell is above the privileged access overload threshold, all the privileged

mobile-terminating access requests are rejected.

Figure 2 shows how the privileged access

admission control function is related to the admission control decisions of

mobile-terminating access requests.

Figure 2   Admission Control for Privileged Access

## 3.3 Privileged Access

Without the activation of the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

feature, Privileged Access (PA) user requests are always admitted by the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature. When the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature

is activated, PA user requests are rejected in case of overload. Activating the two features

together with the Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature, the PA user requests that are

about to be rejected because of overload, are queued instead.

The following types of requests are considered to be PA:

- RRC Connection Requests with emergency or high priority access establishment cause.
- For handover requests and reestablishments where any of the E-RABs has an Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level equal to or below the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. Call queuing function is not available for handover requests and RRC connection reestablishment requests.
- With the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature activated, the mobile-terminating access requests with paging priority higher than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This threshold is configured by the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute.

# 4 Network Impact of Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

This feature improves the retainability and integrity KPIs by rejecting Privileged

Access (PA) requests in case the resources are not

available.

Capacity and Performance

This feature improves the admission control process of the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature. It ensures additional protection of the system against high number

of PA users overloading the node in a short time. This feature improves the

retainability and integrity KPIs. As PA user requests can be rejected in case of

high load, the rejection rates of the following PIs are increased:

- High Load Cell Handover Rejection Rate
- High Load Cell RRC Connection Establishment Fail Rate
- High Load Cell RRC Connection Reestablishment Fail Rate

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.12 or later is required for this feature.

# 5 Parameters for Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

The feature introduces MOM attributes for

configuration.

# 6 Performance of Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

The feature measures failed connections and handovers, and it monitors system

resource use for Privileged Access (PA) UE

requests.

KPIs

The feature is expected to improve retainability and maintain the cell throughput on

an acceptable level during overload scenarios for PA requests, at the cost of
