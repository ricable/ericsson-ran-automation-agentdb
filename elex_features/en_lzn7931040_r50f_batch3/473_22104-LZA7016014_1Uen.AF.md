Summary

The Incoming NR IRAT Handover feature handles handovers arriving from an NR cell connected to

the 5G core network to an LTE cell connected to the EPC over the N26 interface.

Handover requests from the 5G core network to the LTE network are expected because

service coverage of the 5G network is smaller than that of the LTE network. This

feature provides reduced interruptions to data flows during session transition from

an NR cell to an LTE cell.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

- ENM version 20.1 or later is required for this feature.
- The UE must be capable of handover from the 5G network to the LTE network.
- All network elements in the source and target core networks and RANs, as well as the LTE cell must be ready for IRAT handover from NR to LTE over the N26 interface.

# 3 Feature Operation of Incoming NR IRAT Handover

The feature enhances the eNodeB to support incoming IRAT handovers from the

gNodeB.

Following the deployment of the 5G network, IRAT handovers from a 5G-RAN node are

necessary due to the occasional lack of NR SA coverage. Therefore, the mobility function

between the 5G system and the EPS must be supported. To achieve this, the eNodeB is

enhanced to handle incoming IRAT handovers from a gNodeB.

Figure 1   IRAT Handover from gNodeB

This feature handles an incoming handover from an NR cell to an LTE cell, where the

eNodeB and the gNodeB are connected to the EPC and the 5G Core network respectively. The

feature maintains a connection with a UE in connected mode with minimal performance

impact when moving between an NR and an LTE cell.

The 3GPP defines the N26 interface between the MME in EPC and the Access and Mobility

Management Function in 5GC. This interface is required to enable seamless session

continuity for single registration mode UEs when the connected network for the UE is

changed. When the source gNodeB decides that the UE must be handed over to the E-UTRAN

because of

- new radio conditions,
- load balancing issues,
- or service related reasons,

the AMF forwards the UE context to the MME over the N26 interface. Subsequently,

the UPF and the SGW are interworking for data forwarding between the 5G system and the

EPS.

This feature handles the S1 HANDOVER REQUEST message received from the

target MME and sends S1 HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message back to the

target MME. The EPS Bearer Setup list includes a list of addresses and TEIDs allocated

at the target eNodeB for downlink traffic on the S1-U reference point, that is, one TEID

for each bearer. It also includes addresses and TEIDs for receiving forwarded data if

necessary.

Direct packet forwarding can be blocked if the source gNodeB is included in the gNodeB

blocklist and the ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail attribute

is set to FALSE.

Figure 2   IRAT Handover with N26 Procedure

Operational Process

The eNodeB treats an incoming handover from an NR cell the same way it treats an

incoming S1-based handover from an LTE cell.

Figure 3   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The eNodeB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message from the MME.
2. The eNodeB performs admission control on receipt of the HANDOVER REQUEST. If the HANDOVER REQUEST is rejected by admission control, the eNodeB sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the MME and the handover procedure terminates.
3. The eNodeB checks if the license for the Incoming NR IRAT Handover feature exists. If the license is not operable, the eNodeB sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the MME and the handover procedure terminates.
4. The eNodeB allocates cell resources required for the UE. If any resource allocation failure occurs, the eNodeB sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the MME and the handover procedure terminates.
5. The eNodeB sends a HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message with the information about the assigned resources to the MME. The source NR cell forwards this information to the UE, then the UE attempts the handover to the target LTE cell using the assigned resources.
6. If the UE is successfully connected, that is, RA and RRC CONNECTION RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE messages are received from the UE, the eNodeB sends a HANDOVER NOTIFY message to the MME. Otherwise, the eNodeB releases the resources allocated for the UE.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Incoming NR IRAT Handover

## 9.1 Prevention of Configuration Reset of the ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail Attribute

If the ExternalGNodeBFunction MO instance is removed and recreated by

the Automated Neighbor Relations feature, the configuration of the

ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail is reset and direct

packet forwarding is enabled. The operation of the following features can be

affected:

- Automated Neighbor Relations
- X2 Configuration EN-DC
- Incoming NR IRAT Handover

To keep the configuration of the

ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail MO attribute, the removal

of the ExternalGNodeBFunction MO instance can be prevented, by

setting the ExternalGUtranCell.isRemoveAllowed attribute to

false.
