# 1 Automatic SCell Management Overview

The feature enables the automatic configuration of cells as SCells for carrier

aggregation on existing cell relations.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature detects potential SCells based on hit rate. The detected cells are

configured as SCell candidates, so carrier aggregation features can include them in

SCell candidate lists. The feature can also configure SCells with low hit rate as

not suitable for carrier aggregation.

Hit rate is defined as the likelihood of a certain target cell to be qualified as

SCell for the UE in the PCell. To estimate the hit rate value for each cell

relation, periodic Report Strongest Cells measurements are performed by inactive UEs

connected to the PCell.

When the qualified periodic measurement report from the UE is received, the eNodeB

performs the following steps:

- It decreases the hit rate value of all cell relations on the measured frequency.
- It increases the hit rate value of the qualified cell relation reported as the strongest cell.

If the periodic measurement report is not qualified, the hit rate value decreases for

all cell relations on the measured frequency.

Additional Information

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Automatic SCell Management

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Automatic SCell Management

The feature detects potential SCells and configures them as SCell candidates based on

their hit rate.

Operational Process

If the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute of a cell

relation is set to AUTO, the

EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is updated at each

asmStatus update cycle, which is 1 hour long.

Changing the value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate

attribute from AUTO has the following results for the cell relation

at the next update cycle:

- The Automatic SCell Management feature is switched off.
- The hit rate table is removed.
- The EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set to NOT\_ALLOWED.

The EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection attribute can be set to

the following values to define cell detection for a frequency relation:

| OFF                |    | Disables SCell detection on the related frequency relation. The                                 Automatic SCell Management feature does not initiate periodic                                 measurements on this frequency relation.   |

| EXTERNAL           |    | Enables SCell detection and configuration for external cells.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| EXTERNAL_AND_LOCAL |    | Enables SCell detection and configuration for local and external                                 cells.                                                                                                                                  |

When the value of the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection

attribute is changed, all cell relations in the frequency relation that are excluded

by the new value are affected in the following ways:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set to NOT\_ALLOWED.
- The hit rate is set to the initial value.

The Automatic SCell Management feature is configured differently for local and

external cells.

Figure 1   Automatic SCell Management Configuration Part 1

Figure 2   Automatic SCell Management Configuration Part 2

Maximum Number of SCell Candidates

The maximum number of SCells that can be configured in a node for each PCell is

controlled by the AutoSCellMgmFunction.sCellCandidateLimit

attribute. The maximum number of SCells includes the following SCell candidate

types:

- Automatically configured SCell candidates with EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate set to AUTO and EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL
- Manually configured SCell candidates with EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL
- LAA cells

The relations to LAA cells use the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed

MO, which cannot be configured by the Automatic SCell Management feature. LAA cells

are always considered to be potential SCell candidates. The Automatic SCell

Management feature uses LAA cells only to determine the limit.

It is possible to have a higher number of manually configured SCell candidates than

the defined maximum number of SCells. The automatic configuration of SCell

candidates is only possible when the number of LAA and manually configured SCells

drops below the limit.

Automatic SCell Management for CBRS Cells

It is not recommended to use the Automatic SCell Management feature for CBRS cells

because the CBRS Domain Coordinator can dynamically change the EARFCN of the CBRS

cell when frequency grants are modified by the SAS.

## 3.1 Cell Relation Qualification

The qualification is performed by using reported RSRP and RSRQ values, and A1 measurement

and A2 measurement attributes.

The reported strongest cell is considered as qualified cell if the following conditions

are met:

- The cell relation is known.
- If ReportConfigSCellA1A2.triggerQuantityA1A2 is set to RSRP: Reported RSRP value ≥ ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrp
- If ReportConfigSCellA1A2.triggerQuantityA1A2 is set to RSRQ: Reported RSRQ value ≥ ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrq

The Automatic SCell Management feature can fail to detect an

available SCell candidate if any of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The signal strength of the cell is too low.
- The hardware configuration is incorrect.
- Interference occurs from other cells.
- The UE is in an ASG and the inter-frequency measurements with measurement gap are disabled.

## 3.2 Periodic Measurement Intensity Control

The periodic measurement intensity for each hour for each frequency on PCell is

controlled by the following intensity control parameters:

- AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportDecr
- AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportIncr
- AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMax
- AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMin

Changing these parameters instantly updates the periodic measurement intensity.

High Intensity Period

During a high intensity period, the periodic measurement intensity is at maximum for

48 hours. The targeted maximum intensity is defined by the

AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMax attribute. The

high intensity timer is triggered by the following conditions:

- The feature license is activated. The timer starts on each frequency relation with the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection attribute set to LOCAL, EXTERNAL, or EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL.
- The PCell becomes enabled when the feature is active. The timer starts on every frequency relation of the enabled PCell with the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection attribute set to LOCAL, EXTERNAL, or EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL.
- The EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection attribute is changed to LOCAL, EXTERNAL, or EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL when the feature is active. The timer is started only for this frequency relation.
- The value of the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection is changed in the following way: From LOCAL to EXTERNAL or EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL From EXTERNAL to LOCAL or EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL

After the timer expires, the intensity starts to decrease (defined by the

AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportDecr) until low

intensity is reached.

Low Intensity Period

During a low intensity period, the periodic measurements intensity is at minimum, to

reflect changes in existing cells such as coverage change. The targeted minimum

intensity is defined by the

AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMin attribute.

High Intensity Periodic Measurements and Hit Rate

The measurements start with high intensity at feature activation or cell and node

restart to get enough statistics for the hit rate table. The time it takes for the

hit rate table to provide valid information depends on the following factors:

- Number of cell connections
- AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMax value

### 3.2.1 Consolidation of Measurement Intensity Control

The following features use the same periodic measurement function:

- Automatic SCell Management
- Automated Neighbor Relations
- Cell Sleep Mode

The measurement intensity control is consolidated among these features, which means

that the need for high intensity always supersedes the need for low intensity. The

periodic measurement intensity control is set by the highest value of the following

attributes if the corresponding feature is activated:

- Maximum target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMax AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportMax CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportMax
- Increment of the target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportIncr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportIncr CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportIncr
- Minimum target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMin AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportMin CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportMin
- Decrement of the target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportDecr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportDecr CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportDecr

### 3.2.2 Disabling Inter-Frequency Measurements Based on ASGH

Inter-frequency measurements triggered by the Automatic SCell Management feature can

be disabled in a subscriber group for downlink and uplink UE throughput

improvement.

If the UE is in a subscriber group, the inter-frequency measurements triggered by the

Automatic SCell Management feature can be disabled. This is possible if the measurements

need measurement gap.

For disabling the measurements, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute must

include the value that corresponds the Automatic SCell Management feature name.

With the disabled inter-frequency measurements, the downlink and uplink throughput

improves for the UE. However, the detection of SCell candidates can be less

effective.

If the Cell Sleep Mode feature is enabled to configure inter-frequency periodic

measurements, the measurements cannot be disabled for the Automatic SCell Management

feature. The reason is that these features use the same inter-frequency periodic

measurement function for inactive UEs.

## 3.3 Periodic Measurements for Hit Rate Estimation

Periodic measurements are performed on inactive UEs if the feature is activated. The

measurements are needed to estimate hit rate.

Inactive UEs are configured to perform Report Strongest Cells measurement on the selected

frequency if the ReportConfigEUTRA IE of the

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message contains the following

fields:

- periodical::purpose = reportStrongestCells
- triggerQuantity = rsrp
- reportQuantity = both
- maxReportCells = 1
- reportAmount = r1 if the UE is Release 10 or later and has no sCell configured. Otherwise, reportAmount= r2.
- reportInterval = ms1024

## 3.4 Automatic SCell Management-Triggered Inter-Node Tunnel

The Automatic SCell Management feature can trigger tunnel configuration for the

Elastic RAN and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features.

Tunnel configuration for the Elastic RAN and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

features can be enabled by setting the value of the

EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute to

ALLOWED for external cell relations.

The differentiable default value of the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellPriority attribute can be assigned for

new cell relations (cell relations converted from candidate cell relations are an

exception) from the following nodes:

- Local node
- Remote co-sited node
- Remote non-co-sited node

The following conditions apply if the tunnel is not established between the nodes:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set to CANDIDATE.
- The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail or the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute is set to a different value than ENABLED.

When the value of the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is

changed from ALLOWED for the last SCell on the external node, the node

stays connected with the Elastic RAN link.

Once the Elastic RAN tunnel is established, the node stays connected even if there are no

cell relations with the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute set to

ALLOWED on the external node.

The Inter Node Feature

Incompatibility alarm is raised when the Elastic RAN or inter-eNodeB

Carrier Aggregation connection tunnel triggered by the Automatic SCell Management

feature cannot be set up. The alarm can be suppressed when the following conditions are

met:

- The tunnel setup is automatically triggered by the Automatic SCell Management feature.
- The tunnel setup fails because of one of the following cases: The Elastic RAN feature is not activated in the remote node. The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is not activated in the remote node. The Elastic RAN and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are not activated in the remote node.
- The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute is set to true.

If the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is

suppressed, the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_ASM\_TRIGGERED\_ALARM\_SUPPRESSED event is

reported.

## 3.5 Automatic SCell Management-Triggered Intra-Node Tunnel

The Automatic SCell Management feature can trigger tunnel configuration for

intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module carrier aggregation.

If an internal E5 tunnel between the capacity modules cannot be found, the Automatic

SCell Management feature can trigger tunnel configuration. To trigger the setup of the

internal E5 tunnel between the capacity modules, the following conditions must be

met:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to AUTO.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL.

## 3.6 Disabled SCell Handling

A configuration value for SCell handling changes for cell relations that target

potential SCells.

For the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail and the

EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

attributes, the PCELL\_DISABLED value has higher priority in a relation

than the SCELL\_DISABLED value. The PCELL\_DISABLED

value might be overwritten by any value that is not SCELL\_DISABLED.

The PCELL\_DISABLED value has higher priority in a relation than the

SCELL\_DISABLED value.

Local SCells

If the value of the operationalState attribute is set to

DISABLED for a local cell, the following results are applicable

to all cell relations between the cell and the potential SCells:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute or the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute is set to PCELL\_DISABLED.Note: This is also applicable for local manual SCell candidates.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set from ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL to CANDIDATE.

The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail or

the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

attribute is set to LOCAL\_SCELL\_DISABLED or

ICM\_SCELL\_DISABLED for the relations to the cell in which the

locked cell is a potential SCell. This is applicable for local cell relations to

disabled cells.

If the value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

attribute is set to ICM\_SCELL\_DISABLED, this value might be

overwritten by any other value that indicates that the resource is inoperable.

External SCells

The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail or

the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

attribute is set to ESCELL\_DISABLED if either of the following

attributes are set to DISABLED first for an external cell, then for

all cell relations:

- ExternalEUtranCellFDD.remoteCellState
- ExternalEUtranCellTDD.remoteCellState

This is also applicable for external manual SCell candidates.

# 4 Network Impact of Automatic SCell Management

The feature can impact MP load and memory usage.

Capacity and Performance

Additional UE measurements and PM events of the feature can slightly increase the MP

load. The hit rate table creation process can increase memory use.

UE throughput can decrease when inactive UEs become active and require the

measurement gap.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Automatic SCell Management

# 7 Activate Automatic SCell Management

The feature must be activated following the usual feature activation procedure. Cell

relations and frequencies are need to be configured for the feature.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012123 MO instance.
2. Set the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection attribute to one of the following values for the frequency to be used by the feature: Value Result LOCAL Detection and configuration is enabled for local cells. EXTERNAL Detection and configuration is enabled for external cells. EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL Detection and configuration is enabled for local cells and external cells. This is the default value.
3. Set the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute to AUTO for the cell relation to be used by the feature.
4. If the inter-cell distance is larger than 300 meters, set the EUtranCellRelation.asmSCellDlOnlyAllowed attribute to DL\_ONLY for the cell relation.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Automatic SCell Management

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012123 MO instance.

Results

The feature is deactivated and all EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus

attributes are set to NOT\_ALLOWED on the eNodeB.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

Engineering Guidelines for Automatic SCell Management

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Automatic SCell Management

## 9.1 Disabling the Automatic SCell Management Feature

The feature can be disabled separately for each cell or frequency.

Disabling the Feature on Cell Level

Setting the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute to

NOT\_ALLOWED or ALLOWED disables the feature

for the cell. This also sets the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus

attribute to NOT\_ALLOWED for the cell.

Disabling the Feature on Frequency Level

Setting the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection to

OFF disables the feature for the frequency. This also sets all

EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attributes to

NOT\_ALLOWED under this EUtranFreqRelation MO

instance.

## 9.2 Inter Node Feature Incompatibility Alarm Suppression

The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute suppresses

the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm.

The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute controls

whether the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is

raised because of a tunnel setup failure. If configured, the attribute takes effect at

the next alarm suppression. The

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_ASM\_TRIGGERED\_ALARM\_SUPPRESSED PM event is

reported when the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm

is suppressed.

The Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is suppressed

when the following conditions are all met:

- The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute is set to TRUE.
- One of the following conditions is true: The Elastic RAN feature is not activated in the remote node. The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is not activated in the remote node. The Elastic RAN and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are not activated in the remote node.
- The Elastic RAN or Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation connection tunnel setup is automatically triggered by the Automatic SCell Management feature.

If all conditions are fulfilled, the alarm is suppressed for the following additional

texts:

- Inter Node Feature Incompatibility, Elastic RAN feature is not activated in remote eNodeB
- Inter Node Feature Incompatibility, Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation is not activated in remote eNodeB
- Inter Node Feature Incompatibility, Neither Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation nor Elastic RAN is activated in remote eNodeB

## 9.3 Configuration for Customizing Default SCell Selection Priority

The default value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellPriority

attribute can be customized based on whether a cell relation is from a local, remote

co-sited, or remote non-co-sited node.

Configuration for Neighboring Cells between Local and Remote Nodes

The EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityLocal and the

EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtNonCoSited attributes must

be configured per frequency to customize the default value of the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellPriority attribute.

If a higher priority is preferred for the SCell from a local node than from a remote

node, the EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityLocal attribute must be

set to a higher value than the

EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtNonCoSited attribute.

Configuration for Neighboring Cells among Local, Remote Co-Sited, and

Non-Co-Sited Nodes

The following attributes must be configured per frequency:

- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtCoSited
- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtNonCoSited
- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityLocal

The ExternalENodeBFunction.coSited attribute must be configured

manually based on whether the external eNodeB is co-sited.

If a higher priority is preferred for the SCell from a local node than from a remote

co-sited and non-co-sited node, the

EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityLocal attribute must be set

to a higher value than the following attributes:

- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtCoSited
- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtNonCoSited

Benefits

This feature enhancement extends the Automatic SCell Management feature to cells in

neighboring nodes. The enhancement also introduces attributes that improve the

configurability of the Automatic SCell Management feature.

Capacity and Performance

The system load is slightly increased because of additional UE measurements and

internal events.

UE throughput can be decreased when inactive UEs become active, because the UEs

require the measurement gap for the measurement period.

The throughput decrease can be more significant immediately after the activation of

the feature and during the high intensity measurement period. The decrease is

mitigated with the automatic transition to the low intensity measurement period.

After node restart, some cell relations are unavailable for carrier aggregation until

the first asmStatus update cycle is completed. The order in

which the cells become available depends on the order in which the cells are

unlocked.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

AutoSCellMgmFunction.sCellCandidateLimit attribute.

The following attributes are introduced to replace the

EUtranCellRelation.esCellCaConfigurationAvail and

EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.esCellCaConfigurationAvail

attributes:

- EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail
- EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

The following attributes are deprecated and replaced by the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail and

EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

attributes:

- EUtranCellRelation.esCellCaConfigurationAvail
- EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.esCellCaConfigurationAvail

The EXTERNAL and the EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL values are

added to the EUtranFreqRelation.asmSCellDetection attribute. The

default value is changed to EXTERNAL\_AND\_LOCAL. Because of this,

the feature evaluates both external and local cells on the frequency by default.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

## Appendix A.b: 24.Q2.0: Configurable Default SCell Selection Priority for Local and External SCell Candidates

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to configure the default SCell

priority and to suppress the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility

alarm.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows for the configuration of the default value of the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellPriority attribute from local, remote

co-sited, and remote non-co-sited nodes. A functionality is also introduced to

suppress the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm

when the Elastic RAN or Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation connection tunnel triggered

by the Automatic SCell Management feature cannot be set up.

By introducing these functionalities, this feature enhancement reduces the need for

manual operator intervention.

The maintenance work needed to handle connection tunnel setup failures is reduced

with the alarm suppression functionality.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement introduces the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_ASM\_TRIGGERED\_ALARM\_SUPPRESSED PM event,

which provides observability for the suppression of the Inter Node

Feature Incompatibility alarm.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes related to the

configuration of default SCell priority selection:

- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtCoSited
- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityExtNonCoSited
- EUtranFreqRelation.sCellPriorityLocal
- ExternalENodeBFunction.coSited

This feature enhancement introduces the

AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute, which

allows for the configuration of alarm suppression.

The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute controls

whether the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is

raised because of a tunnel setup failure.

If alarm suppression is enabled, the alarm is suppressed for the following additional

texts:

- Inter Node Feature Incompatibility, Elastic RAN feature is not activated in remote eNodeB
- Inter Node Feature Incompatibility, Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation is not activated in remote eNodeB
- Inter Node Feature Incompatibility, Neither Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation nor Elastic RAN is activated in remote eNodeB

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
