# 1 Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling Overview

The Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature provides a new way of baseband uplink

resource distribution.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature is responsible for allocating air-interface

resources to users. Each uplink scheduler for cells on the same Baseband operates

independently, through the shared hardware. The uplink resource capacity of the

Baseband is distributed based on the number of users with uplink transmission

requirements.

When large user traffic differences are measured between cells, the default baseband resource

distribution way may result in inferior performance due to inefficient hardware

utilization.

This feature implements a resource-optimized way of baseband resource distribution based on

the portion of the estimated uplink resource blocks of the cells in the same

Baseband.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improved hardware utilization
- Improved uplink throughput

The benefits of the feature can be observed with the following existing

PM

Counters:

- UL PRB Utilization
- UL Throughput

# 2 Dependencies of Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling

The Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature has conflicting dependency with

Baseband Resource Cell Prioritization feature.

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No special network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling

This section contains the operational process of the Resource-Optimized Uplink

Scheduling feature.

This feature provides a new way of distributing baseband uplink resources, based on the

estimated cell resources. The uplink resource capacity of the baseband is distributed

more efficiently because user traffic differences between cells are taken into account.

Operational Process

The Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature allows the optimization of hardware

utility and uplink throughput performance. It provides different ways of

distributing baseband resources for each scenario.

If Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling is activated, the uplink

resources

of the

basedband

are

distributed according to the estimated

resources

of

cells involved, see figure

1 for

an example.

# 4 Network Impact of Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling

The Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature improves the uplink throughput under a

target

scenario.

Capacity and Performance

The Resource-Optimized Uplink Scheduling feature can improve the uplink throughput

under a target scenario. The gain depends on the site load, the number of cells

activated and the UE and traffic distribution of these cells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
