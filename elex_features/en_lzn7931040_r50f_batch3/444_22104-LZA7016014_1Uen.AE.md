Summary

The Global SCell Evaluation feature evaluates all PCell and UE-relevant SCell

combinations. This results in an enhanced effective bandwidth evaluation function.

The evaluation function considers the following factors when determining SCell

combinations:

- Downlink and uplink bandwidth
- High-order modulation capability
- Whether the SCell is FDD, TDD, or LAA
- Uplink weight in the combination
- MIMO layers
- Configured SCell and frequency priorities when the Configurable SCell Priority feature is activated
- Cell load based on SCell credits

The feature has the following benefits:

- Suboptimal initial selection of SCell combinations is avoided through the introduction of global search over all supported band combinations.
- The UE throughput gain provided by carrier aggregation is improved. This is because of the better use of available resources for SCell data scheduling.
- The best potential throughput is provided for the UE by enhancing the Effective Bandwidth Evaluation function to consider more factors.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature does not support interworking with NR. An EN-DC configured UE cannot use

the Global SCell Evaluation feature during initial SCell selection and

reselection.

Network Requirements

ENM 19.08 version is required for the feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Global SCell Evaluation

The feature evaluates carrier aggregation band combinations. It considers various

factors to find the SCell band combinations with the best potential throughput for the

UE.

Different initial SCell blind selection methods are available depending on the activated

SCell selection-related features and the setup of the

CarrierAggregationFunction.dynamicSCellSelectionMethod

attribute.

## 3.1 SCell Selection Process

The feature can evaluate band combinations with any number of component carriers

(CCs) depending on the configured SCell selection mode.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Global SCell Evaluation algorithm compares UE capabilities with the configuration of the eNodeB and the activated carrier aggregation features. This determines the possible band combinations for SCell selection.
2. The evaluation can include band combinations with any number of component carriers or can be restricted to band combinations on certain CC levels. This depends on the on the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode and CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellEvaluationLevel attributes: Table 3 Evaluation of Band Combinations sCellSelectionMode sCellEvaluationLevel Evaluation Method ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION N/A The band combinations are evaluated on one CC aggregation level at a time. It starts on the 2 CC level. ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION EFFECTIVE All band combinations on all CC levels are evaluated at the same time. HIGH The band combinations are evaluated on the highest possible CC level.
3. The evaluation rates the band combinations based on the following factors: Downlink and uplink bandwidth High order modulation capability Whether the SCell is FDD, TDD, or LAA Uplink weight in the combination MIMO layers Configured SCell and frequency priorities when the Configurable SCell Priority feature is activated Cell load, based on SCell Credits
    1. If any SCell of the selected band combination has the EUtranFreqRelation.caFreqPriority or EUtranCellRelation.sCellPriority set to -1, the combination is not selected at initial SCell selection. The SCell can be selected at reselection when reported by A6, see Configurable SCell Priority. If this results in no valid SCell combinations, the outcomes are the following, depending on the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode and CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellEvaluationLevel attributes: Table 4 Outcome of Evaluation without Valid SCell Combination sCellSelectionMode sCellEvaluationLevel Outcome ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION N/A Waiting period starts for next SCell configuration.(1) ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION EFFECTIVE Waiting period starts for next SCell configuration.(1) HIGH The evaluation restarts with band combinations on the lower CC level. If all CC levels are evaluated and there is no SCell among the CCs (just the PCell), waiting period starts for next SCell configuration.(1) (1) Controlled by theCarrierAggregationFunction.waitForCaOpportunity or CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForAdditionalSCellOpportunity attribute
    2. If the evaluation finds valid SCell combinations, it selects the one with highest rating. Note: If there are more than one SCell combination with the same highest rating, the following applies: If the selection mode is simultaneous and the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellEvaluationLevel attribute is set to EFFECTIVE, the SCell combination on the lowest CC level is selected. In any other configurations, one is randomly selected.
5. The SCells in the selected combination are configured for the UE.

SCell Reselection

If A1 is not received or A2 or A6 is received  after the initial SCell configuration,

the reselection process is triggered. Possible band combinations are evaluated. If a

band combination with better throughput is found, the SCells are reconfigured.

## 3.2 Effective Bandwidth Evaluation

This function rates the band combinations that are selected for the UE by the Global

Bandwidth Evaluation algorithm. The combination with the best result is configured for the

UE.

The band combinations are evaluated by considering various configurations of the eNodeB

and the activated features.

## 3.3 Uplink Weight in the Evaluation

If the Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature is activated, the weight of the

uplink-capable band combinations in the effective bandwidth evaluation can be set by the

CarrierAggregationFunction.selectionPolicyUlWeighting attribute. The

attribute can be set to -1 to have the system internally set the preference

between downlink and uplink carrier aggregation.

Initial SCell Selection

If the CarrierAggregationFunction.selectionPolicyUlWeighting

attribute is set to -1, the

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference attribute is

considered in the following way:

SCell Reselection

If CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to

ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION, uplink-capable band

combinations are preferred if there are no uplink-capable SCells after the

deconfiguration. This happens regardless of the value of the

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference attribute.

## 3.4 Load Distribution in Global SCell Evaluation

The feature considers the current and the maximum number of SCell configurations

during the effective bandwidth evaluation to balance the UE load on the SCells.

The load balancing uses a credit handling algorithm. The maximum number of credits can be

set by the operator. Each SCell configuration uses up one credit. When credits are used

up on a high priority frequency, the next lower prioritized frequency with credits left

is used. An SCell is excluded from the evaluation when all credit for an SCell are used up.

The maximum number of credit for an SCell is calculated as the following formula:

If the Configurable SCell Priority feature is activated, the maximum number of credits

for an SCell on a frequency is calculated as the following:

Updating the Maximum Number of SCell Configurations

The following operations update the maximum number of SCell credits:

- Adding or removing a EUtranCellRelation MO with SCell candidate if the corresponding EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED
- Setting the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute from ALLOWED to NOT\_ALLOWED or the other way around
- Changing the EUtranCellFDD.caPrioThreshold or EUtranCellTDD.caPrioThreshold attribute

If the Configurable SCell Priority feature is activated, the following

operations also update the maximum number of SCell credits:

- Changing the EUtranFreqRelation.caFreqProportion attribute
- Changing the EUtranCellRelation.sCellPriority attribute

# 4 Network Impact of Global SCell Evaluation

The feature can increase carrier aggregation throughput and allows controlling the

number of SCell configurations. It can also increase MP load.

Capacity and Performance

The enhanced effective bandwidth evaluation algorithm helps finding the best SCell

combination considering the capacity and configuration of the UE and eNodeB. This

can increase carrier aggregation throughput in downlink and uplink. The better

utilization of the available resources for SCell data scheduling decreases the

number of SCell configurations.

The feature can increase the time of the SCell configuration process for the UE. This

can result in increased MP load, depending on the following factors:

- the number of SCell candidates on the node
- the number of frequencies with SCell candidates
- the number of connected UEs with the capability for five or more component carriers

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Global SCell Evaluation

The feature introduces new parameters and is affected by parameters that are related

to SCell load balancing.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Global SCell Evaluation

Avoiding Downlink-only SCell Selection

If the selection mode is simultaneous and the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellEvaluationLevel attribute is

set to HIGH, the band combinations are evaluated on the highest

possible component  level. If there is no uplink capable SCell among the

combinations on the highest component carrier level, there is no uplink component in

the SCell selection. To avoid this possibility, set the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellEvaluationLevel to

EFFECTIVE or the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode to

ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.

This enhancement enables the effective bandwidth evaluation function of the feature

to support all the possible values of the

EUtranFreqRelation.caFreqPriority attribute. It also provides an

easier configuration of the preference between downlink and uplink carrier aggregation in

simultaneous mode SCell selection.

| Access Type:            | LTE                          |

Benefits

This enhancement provides the following benefits:

- User-friendly setting of how the potential bandwidth evaluation weighs between downlink and uplink. The operator can choose to have the system internally set the preference between downlink or uplink carrier aggregation in simultaneous mode SCell selection.
- Support for the full range of frequency carrier priorities.
- Reduced processing delay time in SCell configuration.

Capacity and Performance

The SCell configuration time for each UE can decrease, resulting in smaller MP

load.

Operation

- The Configurable SCell Priorities feature must be activated for the EUtranFreqRelation.caFreqPriority attribute to be considered.
- The Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature must be activated and the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode must be set to ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION or UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION for the CarrierAggregationFunction.selectionPolicyUlWeighting and CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference attributes to be considered. If the above criteria are met, setting the CarrierAggregationFunction.selectionPolicyUlWeighting to -1 has the following impact on the potential effective bandwidth evaluation: At initial SCell selection, CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference applies. At SCell reselection, band combinations with uplink component carriers (CCs) are preferred if there are no uplink CCs on any configured SCells after the deconfiguration. This happens regardless of the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference attribute.
