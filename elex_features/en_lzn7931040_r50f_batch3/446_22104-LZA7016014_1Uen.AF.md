Summary

The feature improves the accessibility of voice requests by allowing for the

following processes:

- Incoming RRC connection request messages can be identified by the UE as mobile-originating voice requests.
- Mobile-originating voice requests are prioritized higher than other data connections during high load. This results in a higher probability for them to be admitted.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load

The Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load feature enhances VoLTE access by using increased

priority Mobile Originating Voice requests in Dynamic UE Admission

Control.

An incoming RRC Connection Request is recognized as voice-related request using the

mo-VoiceCall-v1280 parameter that adheres to 3GPP TS

36.331 V12.8.0.

The following benefits can be observed by enabling the Optimized VoLTE Access at High

Load feature:

- Decreased number of admission control functionality rejections for voice-related requests.
- Configurable traffic prioritization in admission control of voice-related requests.

To observe feature benefits, the following prerequisites must be met:

- High load in the network, which means that the differentiation threshold in the Dynamic UE Admission control feature must be reached.
- The voiceServiceCauseIndication-r12 3GPP standard parameter must be set to true.
- The SIB2 must order UEs to use mo-VoiceCall when initiating Voice calls.
- UEs need to support 3GPP TS 36.331 V12.8.0.

Operational Process

The introduction of the mo-VoiceCall establishment cause enables additional

differentiation of non-PA requests. Such requests are now identified as Mobile

Originating Voice. This feature increases the priority of Mobile Originating Voice

requests resulting in an increased chance for the requests to be admitted.

Figure 1    Mobile Originating Voice Call Introduction in Dynamic UE Admission

Control

A Mobile Originating voice request is given the same priority level as

Reestablishment and Handover requests. This means that the following processes are

implemented:

- When the xxDynUeAdmRetDiffThr threshold is reached, all Mobile Originating Voice, Reestablishment and Handover requests are admitted. Other non-PA requests are rejected.
- When the xxDynUeAdmOverloadThr threshold is reached, all Mobile Originating Voice, Reestablishment and Handover requests are rejected. Only PA requests are admitted.

Different behavior of the system can be achieved by configuring the two thresholds

differently in the following ways:

- If Mobile Originating Voice, Reestablishment and Handover request prioritization is needed, the xxDynUeAdmOverloadThr prioritization threshold must be set to its maximum value. Note: This impacts resources reserved for PA requests.
- If no resources need to be reserved for Mobile Originating Voice, Reestablishment and Handover requests the xxDynUeAdmRetDiffThr threshold must be set to the same value as xxDynUeAdmOverloadThr.

By proper configuration of the resources reserved by the two thresholds, the

accessibility of Mobile Originating Voice, Reestablishment and Handover requests can

be adjusted according to traffic needs.

Figure 2    Dynamic UE Admission Control Algorithm

An incoming admission request is first checked if it is PA or not. If the request is

not PA, the blocking state of DUAC state machine is checked:

| Admit All        |    | Request is admitted.                                                                                                          |
|------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Initial Blocking |    | Request is admitted in case it is Mobile Originating Voice, Handover, or                             Reestablishment request. |
|                  |    |                                                                                                                               |
| Block All        |    | Request is rejected.                                                                                                          |

Figure 3    Dynamic UE Admission Control State Machine

In case the request is rejected, the state of Control State Machine in RAC, used for

UE Setup requests, switches from Accept to

Initial Blocking or Block

All depending on the rejected state.

# 4 Network Impact of Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load

The Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load has impact on network interfaces.

Capacity and Performance

The calculation formula for the KPI Initial E-RAB Establishment Success Rate

per QCI is impacted. The newly introduced moVoice call counters are added

to the calculation to compensate for the extraction of MO Voice requests from MO

Data requests.

No impact on overall KPI value is expected.

Interfaces

This feature introduces the following interface related changes:

- RRC related changes SIB2 includes voiceServiceCauseIndication-r12 parameter set to true RRC connection request introduces a 3GPP standard TS36.331 V12.8.0 compatible establishment cause value mo-VoiceCall-v1280.
- S1AP related change. An InitialUEMessage, sent toward the core network, introduces RRC establishment cause value: mo-voicecall.

Other Network Elements

- UEs need to support 3GPP TS36.331, V12.8.0
- This enhancement requires ENM version 19.05 or later.
- Core Network needs to support TS36.413, v13.2.0 or later versions.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load

The Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load feature is an enhancement of the Dynamic UE

Admission Control feature and it ensures acceptance of initial voice RRC Connection Requests

in situations when the xxDynUeAdmRetDiffThr threshold is

reached.

As described in Feature Operation of Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load, different behavior of the system can

be achieved by configuring Dynamic UE Admission Control thresholds to meet the traffic

needs.
