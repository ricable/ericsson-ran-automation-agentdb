# 1 TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control Overview

The feature checks UE capability at RRC connection release to prioritize TM9-capable

frequencies for TM9-capable UEs. The feature can also consider target cell coverage

probability for TM9-capable UEs based on hit-rate measurements.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature prioritizes the frequencies with TM9-capable cells for the UE. The

frequency prioritization for each UE is based on the number or the hit-rate value of

TM9-capable cells on each frequency.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- TM9-capable UEs are steered to a TM9-capable frequency.
- TM9-capable UEs are steered to frequencies with better coverage probability if hit-rate measurements are available.
- The number of TM9-capable UEs that are configured with TM9 in RRC connected mode can be maximized.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

The feature interacts with several other features that mainly concern load management

and frequency prioritization.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

The feature is supported on all Baseband units that support LTE.

Limitations

The feature does not consider cells of eNodeBs from other vendors as highly

loaded.

Network Requirements

ENM version 20.1 or later is required for the feature.

The feature is valid for TM9-capable UEs that are not Category M1 UEs.

# 3 Feature Operation of TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

The feature prioritizes TM9-capable frequencies at RRC connection release for the

UE.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram, Part 1

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram, Part 2

1. The feature operates at RRC connection release.
2. If the UE is involved in CSFB or Release with Redirect, the UE is not affected by the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature.
3. If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is activated, and the SPID value associated with the UE matches the value of the corresponding RATFreqPrio.spidListattribute, the following outcomes are possible: The UE is qualified to be prioritized by the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature if the RATFreqPrio.ueCapPrioAllowed attribute is set to true in the corresponding RATFreqPrio.spidList MO instance. The UE is prioritized by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature if the RATFreqPrio.ueCapPrioAllowed attribute is set to false in the corresponding RATFreqPrio.spidList MO instance.
4. An NR standalone-capable UE is not affected by the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature if the following conditions are met: The UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to a value other than 1, 2, or 3. There is at least one non-restricted NR frequency available. NR frequencies can be restricted because of the following reasons: The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature is not activated. There is no NR frequency relation. The NR restriction in 5GS IE is detected in the HRL IE. The Serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs included in the HRL IE are not present in any GUtranFreqRelation.allowedPLMNList attribute. The Serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs indicated by the HRL IE are included as 5GCFordbidden in the Mobility Restriction List IE.
5. If the UE is qualified to be prioritized by the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature, the UE capability is checked. If the UE is not TM9-capable, it is not affected by the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature.
6. If the UE is TM9-capable and the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature is not active, the TM9-capable frequencies are prioritized for the UE. If the UE is TM9-capable and the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature is active, the following outcomes are possible: If the UE is both EN-DC-capable and TM9-capable, see Frequency Prioritization for EN-DC- and TM9-Capable UEs If the UePolicyOptimization MO is not created, TM9-capable frequencies are prioritized for the UE. If the UePolicyOptimization MO is created, TM9-capable frequencies are only prioritized for the UE if TM9 is configured in the UePolicyOptimization.ueCapPrioList attribute.
7. If all the criteria are met for the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature to affect the UE, the TM9-capable frequencies are placed in the IMMCI IE for the UE. The priority for a frequency is based on the number of TM9-capable cells or the aggregated hit rate of the cells on each frequency. Cells are only considered if they have cell relations from the serving cell. The serving frequency gets the highest priority if it is TM9-capable. If it is not, it is ranked among other E-UTRA frequencies in the prioritization. Other prioritized frequencies are placed in the following order to the IMMCI IE: TM9-capable frequencies E-UTRA frequencies that are not TM9-capable IRAT frequencies other than NR A frequency is not included in the prioritization if it is not supported by the UE according to the reported UE capabilities or if it has the EUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority attribute set to -1. If the UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to 2, after the prioritization of TM9-capable frequencies, NR frequencies with a cell reselection subpriority value other than 0 are selected and prioritized according to the configured cell reselection priority and subpriority. If the UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to 3, after the prioritization of TM9-capable frequencies, NR frequencies are selected regardless of the cell reselection subpriority value. These NR frequencies are prioritized based on the comparison of the relative priority values of the LTE and NR frequencies.
8. The IMMCI IE with the dedicated frequency priorities is sent to the UE in the RRC Connection Release message. The feature considers internal and external cells deployed on Ericsson nodes in the ranking of TM9-capable frequencies. Information must be received over the X2 interface for external cells to be considered TM9-capable. The IMMCI also includes NR frequencies that are selected based on cell reselection priorities and subpriorities.
9. Cell reselection priority is updated.
10. The pmTm9PrioritizedUe PM counter is stepped for each frequency that has a TM9-capable UE that is prioritized with the EUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority attribute set to 7.

For more information on the NR frequencies, see NR Frequency Selection for NR Standalone-Capable UEs.

## 3.1 Frequency Prioritization for EN-DC- and TM9-Capable UEs

The UePolicyOptimization.ueCapPrioList attribute controls if both

EN-DC- and TM9-capable frequencies are included in the prioritization, or only one of

them. It also controls if all EN-DC frequencies have higher priority than TM9

frequencies or the other way around if both of them are prioritized. The attribute is

only considered if both the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and the TM9

Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control features are activated.

Frequencies where the cells have high load can be down

prioritized in the IMMCI IE if the UePolicyOptimization.loadAwareImc

attribute is set to true. The cell load threshold for load-aware idle

mode control can be configured through the

EUtranCellFDD.subscriptionRatioHighThresh or the

EUtranCellTDD.subscriptionRatioHighThresh attribute.

See Figure 3 for the consideration of

the UePolicyOptimization.ueCapPrioList attribute in the frequency

prioritization for EN-DC- and TM9-capable UEs.

Figure 3   UE Capability Prioritization

The order of the frequencies is the following:

(1)

The frequency order for the UE if the serving frequency

is EN-DC-capable is not applicable in case of the

configuration-based, UE capability-based, and load-based

prioritization methods. This is because the

configuration-based, UE capability-based, and load-based

prioritization methods do not give the highest priority

to EN-DC-capable serving frequencies.

For more information on NR frequency

prioritization, see NR Frequency Selection for NR Standalone-Capable UEs.

Example 1   Frequency Priorities

Table 3 shows the  prioritization output

for the following circumstances:

- The UePolicyOptimization.ueCapPrioList attribute is set to EN-DC, TM9.
- The prioritization method is based on number of cells.
- Serving frequency is neither EN-DC or TM9-capable.

Table 3

|   Priority | Frequency         | Number of Cells                            |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|          7 | F2                | 5 EN-DC-capable cells                      |

## 3.2 Prioritization Methods

The EN-DC or TM9 capability-aware frequency prioritization method can be based on hit

rate value or the number of the cells on each frequency. For EN-DC-capable frequencies, the

configuration-based and UE capability-based prioritization methods are also

available.

Prioritization Methods

The order of the frequencies of the same capability is decided by one of following

methods:

Priority of Serving Frequency without EN-DC or TM9 Capability

If the serving frequency does not have the respective capability (EN-DC or TM9), its

priority depends on the prioritization

method.

## 3.3 TM9-Capability of Frequencies

A frequency is considered TM9-capable if at least one cell is TM9-capable in the

frequency. A cell is TM9-capable if one of the following criteria is met:

- The EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode or EUtranCellTDD.transmissionMode attribute is set to TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9 and at least one of the of the following features are active: TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance Package
- The EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode attribute is set to TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9 and the TM9 with AAS FDD feature is active.

## 3.4 NR Frequency Selection for NR Standalone-Capable UEs

NR

standalone-capable UEs can immediately select one of the NR frequencies in the IMMCI while

the t320 timer is running if the UE enters NR coverage in idle mode and if the SIB24 is

broadcast.

An NR SA-capable UE can immediately select one of the NR frequencies in the IMMCI if the

UE enters NR coverage in idle mode and if the SIB24 is broadcast. The UE can select a

frequency while the UePolicyOptimization.t320 timer is running.

To select an NR frequency, the following conditions must be met:

- The sa-NR-r15 IE is set to be supported in UE capability.
- The UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to 2 or 3.
- The NR Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is operable.

NR Frequency Selection

The eNodeB selects the candidate NR frequencies based on the configuration of the

GUtranFreqRelation MO instances. Frequencies are discarded by

the eNodeB if one of the following conditions

applies:

- The GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority attribute is set to -1 for the frequency.
- The frequency is unsupported based on UE capability indicated in the supportedBandListNR-SA-r15 IE.
- The GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute is set to 0 and the UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to 2.Note: If the UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to 3, NR frequencies are included in the prioritization even if the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute is set to 0.
- The serving PLMN and the equivalent PLMN of the frequency are not included in the GUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute.
- The frequency is in the range of 630,000-636,666 if the value of the ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77Supported attribute is set to true, but the UE capability does not indicate IRAT in the extendedBand-n77-r16 RF parameter.
- The frequency is in the range of 643,334-665,333 if the value of the ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute is set to true, but the UE capability does not indicate IRAT in the extendedBand-n77-2- r17 RF parameter.
- The frequency does not have a GUtranFreqRelation MO with a serving cell.
- The NR restriction in 5GS IE is detected in the HRL.
- The serving PLMN and equivalent PLMNs indicated by the HRL are included as 5GCForbidden in the Mobility Restriction List IE.
- The NR-ARFCN value of the NR frequency does not correspond to a standard GSCN value.
- The ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute is set to 2, the source NR frequency is excluded from idle mode mobility back to NR standalone when the UE is moved to LTE network by the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function.

If the value of the UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute

is 2, NR frequencies are prioritized according to the configured

cell reselection priority and cell reselection subpriority.

If the UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to

3, NR frequencies are prioritized based on comparison of the

relative priority values set for LTE and NR frequencies. In this case, the following

prioritization order applies:

1. EN-DC or TM9-capable frequencies are prioritized.
2. The configured cell reselection priority value and cell reselection subpriority value of NR frequencies and the configured cell reselection priority value of LTE frequencies are compared. Based on this comparison, the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control features assign dedicated priorities to the NR frequencies used for idle mode cell reselection. An NR frequency always acquires higher dedicated priority than the dedicated priorities of LTE frequencies whose configured priorities are lower than the NR frequency.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

## 9.1 Configuration of a TM9-Capable Cell

For the feature to affect the UE, at least one cell must be TM9-capable in the target

frequency. A cell is TM9-capable if one of the following criteria is met:

- The EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode or EUtranCellTDD.transmissionMode attribute is set to TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9 and at least one of the of the following features are active: TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance Package
- The EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode attribute is set to TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9 and the TM9 with AAS FDD feature is active.

## 9.2 Target Cell Coverage Probability Calculation

The TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature considers target cell coverage

probability based on hit rate on the target TM9-capable cells if one of the

following features is activated:

- Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management
- Cell Sleep Mode

If both features are active, the hit rate calculated by the Best Neighbor

Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature is considered for target cell

coverage probability.

This function requires the following MO configurations:

- The UePolicyOptimization.coverageAwareImc attribute set to true.
- Table 6 Activation of Hit Rate Calculation Depending on Feature License Activated Feature License Attribute Setting Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management The EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy MO attribute is not set to NOT\_ALLOWED.Note: If the EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy MO attribute is set to NOT\_ALLOWED, hit rate is not calculated on E-UTRAN frequencies. Cell Sleep Mode The EUtranFreqRelation.cellSleepCovCellMeasOn is set to true for the TM9-capable frequency.

## 9.3 Cell Reselection Priority Timer Configuration

The feature uses the value of the UePolicyOptimization.t320

attribute to determine the period of time for the cell reselection priority for the

UE.

## 9.4 Prioritization if Subscriber Triggered Mobility Is Active

If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is active, the prioritization of the UE

depends on the setup of the RATFreqPrio.ueCapPrioAllowed attribute

(in the MO instance corresponding to RATFreqPrio.spidList):

Table 7   Prioritization Method for the UE

| RATFreqPrio.ueCapPrioAllowed   | Effect                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| true                           | The UE can be prioritized by the following features:  Basic Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control     Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control     TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control |
| false                          | The UE is prioritized by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility                                     feature.                                                                          |

## 9.5 Preventing Inter-Frequency Handover in Connected Mode

If the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is active, UEs in connected mode can be

moved to target cells through inter-frequency handover even if load balancing is only

expected in idle mode. To prevent the handover of UEs in connected mode, the

EUtranFreqRelation.lbActivationThreshold attribute, which is

controlled by the IFLB Activation Threshold feature, must be set to the maximum

value.

Summary and Benefits

If this feature enhancement is enabled, the NR frequencies are added to the IMMCI

during the RRC Connection Release procedure based on the configured cell reselection

priorities and

subpriorities.NR

standalone-capable UEs can connect to NR frequencies faster because the UEs can

reselect NR frequencies in idle mode from the IMMCI.

While the UePolicyOptimization.t320 timer is running, the NR

standalone-capable UEs immediately select the NR frequency that is included in the

IMMCI. This is possible only if the UE is in the coverage of the NR cell in idle

mode and the SIB24 is broadcast.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits

for

NR standalone-capable UEs in NR coverage in idle mode:

- NR-standalone capable UEs can be steered in idle mode to be provided with NR coverage in connected mode.
- The duration of NR service delays is reduced.

Capacity and Performance

The Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control

features allow the inclusion of the selected NR frequencies based on the cell

reselection priorities and subpriorities of the

GUtranFreqRelation MO in the IMMCI.

When

the IMMCI is signaled to NR standalone-capable UEs for idle mode mobility control,

the number of RRC connections to the LTE cell are reduced. Because of this, the NR

standalone-capable UEs are steered to the NR cell.

Operation

The feature enhancement is enabled by setting the

2. This affects NR standalone-capable UEs during connection

release if the UE qualifies to be released with prioritized EN-DC or TM9-capable

frequencies. If this configuration is used, the frequency selection process is

performed according to the following steps:

1. EN-DC or TM9-capable frequencies are prioritized.
2. NR frequencies for which the value of the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority attribute is equal to or greater than 0 are selected.
3. NR frequencies with the value of 0 in the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute are disregarded.
4. The RRC Connection Release procedure is performed to the UE with EN-DC or TM9-capable frequencies and NR frequencies in the IMMCI.

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Summary and Benefits

The

features affected by this feature enhancement prioritize the NR frequencies in IMMCI

based on the comparison of the relative priority values set for LTE frequencies and

NR frequencies. These priority values are configured by the operator. The

NR

frequencies are assigned with dedicated priorities for IMMCI based on the relative

priority order. This way, the

NR

and LTE frequencies are sorted in a relative priority order in the IMMCI signaled to

the NR standalone-capable UE during the RRC Connection Release procedure. The NR

standalone-capable UE uses the NR frequencies in IMMCI for cell reselection in idle

mode.

This

feature enhancement increases the chance for NR standalone-capable UEs to be steered

to the desired LTE or NR frequency in idle mode by considering the priority order

between the LTE and NR frequencies. The priority order is configured by the

operator.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is used to enable

this feature enhancement. If the

UePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute is set to

3, the

NR

frequencies in IMMCI are prioritized by the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and

the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control features for NR standalone-capable UEs.

The process considers the relative priority order between the

LTE

frequencies and NR frequencies.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.
