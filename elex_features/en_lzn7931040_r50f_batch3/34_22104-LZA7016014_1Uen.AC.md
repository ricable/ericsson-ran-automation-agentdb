Summary

The Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity feature (optionally combined with

the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature) provides the

RBS with the possibility to release User Equipment (UE) and direct it to a TD-SCDMA

frequency (release with redirect) in the event of poor coverage in the serving

cell.

The purpose of the Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover feature is, first, to extend this

with the option of initiating a handover to a TD-SCDMA cell, instead of initiating a

release. Second, to handle an incoming handover (to an LTE cell) from a TD-SCDMA

cell.

The added benefits of the Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover feature over the

Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity, considering also the possibility to

perform incoming handover from TD-SCDMA to LTE, can be summarized as follows:

- Session transition to a TD-SCDMA cell and from a TD-SCDMA cell to an LTE cell is possible with reduced interruptions to data flows during the transition process.
- Enhanced control over how UEs are transferred between frequencies and cells.
- Using handover to transfer UE between the nodes of different technologies enables the target node (RBS and RNC) to use different admission criteria than would be used at a plain connection setup. This makes it possible to improve the probability that a service, for example, Voice over IP (VoIP) is not interrupted in a network with high load.

In addition, the Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover function can also be seen as

helping to off-load an LTE cell, depending on measurement threshold settings. The

higher the thresholds values of, for example, poor coverage, the better off-loading

is achieved. This way, the different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) (here, mostly

TD-SCDMA) present in the network can be used efficiently to best serve the users

present in the network.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a

valid license key must be installed and the feature must be explicitly activated by

setting a MOM attribute.

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- License keys must be activated to operate both the Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity and Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover feature. Details on the process required to load and activate a license can be found in Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
- The Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity feature must be configured correctly. Details on how to do this can be found in Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity. If the feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is enabled, it must also be configured correctly.
- There must be UE in the network that have the capability do TD-SCDMA handover. This is indicated in bit 38 (or bit 8 for dual mode UE) of the featureGroupIndicators, which is part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability information element as described in TS 36.331.

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

# 3 Feature Operation

This section describes the Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover

feature, considering outgoing handover to TD-SCDMA, in more detail,

including network configuration requirements and operation flows.

This feature extends the Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity

feature and the Mobility Control at Poor

Coverage feature.

The Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity feature uses

the A2 measurement (serving cell becomes worse than threshold) measurement

process to detect poor coverage in the serving cell. The RBS determines

what other frequencies (LTE or other RATs) are target candidates for

transferring the UE.

If the highest prioritized frequency that the UE can handle (has

capabilities for) is a TD-SCDMA frequency, the RBS can do one of the

following two actions:

- When the UE does not have voice bearers established, and the RBS determines that the UE is in sufficiently poor coverage, it can release the UE with a redirection indication for this frequency. This is referred to as "blind release with redirect" .
- Start a B2 measurement (serving becomes worse than threshold1 and inter-RAT neighbor becomes better than threshold2) in the UE to determine whether there is a cell on this TD-SCDMA frequency that is covering the UE. Wait until the UE sends a report for this measurement and release the UE with a redirection indication for this frequency.

The Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover feature extends this

with the following two new options:

- When the RBS determines that the UE is in sufficiently poor coverage, it can initiate a handover for the UE to a cell on the target TD-SCDMA frequency that is known by the RBS to cover the source cell completely. This is referred to as "blind TD-SCDMA handover".
- Start a B2 measurement in the UE to determine whether there is a cell on this TD-SCDMA frequency that is covering the UE. Wait until the UE sends a report for this measurement and initiate a handover for the UE to one of the cells received in the measurement report. This is referred to as "measurement based TD-SCDMA handover".

The circumstances under which the RBS will consider a UE in sufficiently poor coverage, and

what will trigger the RBS to configure a B2 measurement in the UE will vary depending on the

feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage.

Regarding incoming TD-SCDMA handover (using only the S1 connection),

the LTE RBS treats such a handover request exactly like it treats

an incoming handover from an LTE cell.

## 3.1 Triggering WCDMA Handover

### 3.1.1 Blind and Measurement Based Handover

A TD-SCDMA Handover can be triggered in two ways:

- As a blind handover, meaning that the target cell of the handover is chosen based on pre-configured information, that is, not based on measurements performed by the UE
- As a measurement based handover, meaning that the target cell of the handover is chosen based on a TD-SCDMA target measurement report received from the UE

See Configure for Blind TD-SCDMA Handover for how to configure

a cell for blind handover, and Configure for Measurement-Based TD-SCDMA Handover for how to configure for measurement based handover.

### 3.1.2 Features Triggering WCDMA Handover

Details on how and when TD-SCDMA handover is triggered for a certain

UE varies between features, but common criteria are:

- The feature Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover must be OPERABLE.
- The UE must be capable of doing a Handover to a TD-SCDMA cell.
- Information about the target frequency and cell must be configured in the eNodeB, see O&amp;M Information.

See the following features for more details on under what circumstances

TD-SCDMA handover is triggered:

- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

### 3.1.3 Handover Procedure

If a target cell was selected for handover, the RBS proceeds to

prepare and execute the handover attempt. This is done in the same

way as is described in Intra-LTE Handover, with the following two differences:

- The target node is a TD-SCDMA RNC node.
- The connection used when communicating with the node (RNC) handling the target cell is the S1 connection, that is, the communication always goes through the core network, through the Mobility Management Entity (MME).

The events sent from the RBS during handover preparation and execution will contain

information saying that it is a "TD-SCDMA handover" and whether the handover was initiated

based on a preconfigured target cell or whether a B2 measurement was used to find a target

cell, see Table 5.

A TD-SCDMA handover is considered successful if at least one of

the UE's bearers is accepted and established in the TD-SCDMA

target.

## 4.2 Affected Parameters

The implementation of this feature affects no parameters.

# 5 Network Impact

This section describes how the feature impacts the network functions

and capabilities.

## 5.1 Capacity

This section provides information on the impact of the feature

on network capacity.

The feature ensures that network capacity is enhanced by improving

the possibility that the UE is served by the best available frequency

or cell within the network.

## 5.2 Performance

The feature improves the time taken to make connected mode transitions

from an LTE cell to a TD-SCDMA cell.

## 5.3 Configuration impact

This feature provides enhanced active mode mobility between LTE

and TD-SCDMA cells or frequencies in the operator's network. When

the feature is active, UE can be directed to do a handover to a TD-SCDMA

cell while maintaining the data session; also, UE coming from a TD-SCDMA

cell is allowed to be handed over to an LTE cell. Considering outgoing

TD-SCDMA handover, correct configuration of the Coverage-Triggered

TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover feature is required to ensure the following:

- That the UE will be transferred to a TD-SCDMA cell for which the UE has coverage.
- That a B2 measurement is configured in the UE whenever blind handover is not possible.
- That the UE does the handover directly, without a B2 measurement, whenever there is (at least) one target cell which is known to cover the source cell completely.

No special configuration is needed to be able to correctly perform

an incoming handover from a TD-SCDMA cell.

# 7 O&amp;M Information

This section provides Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) information

for this feature.

## 7.1 Activate Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011011 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

## 7.2 Deactivate Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011011 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

## 7.3 Configure for Outgoing TD-SCDMA Handover

Regardless of whether the eNodeB executes

a blind or measurement-based handover for a certain UE, for a certain

TD-SCDMA cell to be usable as target cell for the handover, the following

two parameters must be set to values that are different from the default

value:

| lac   |    | Location area code  Must be sent to the MME to correctly identify the target SGSN that serves the target TD-SCDMA RNC                               |
|-------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       |    |                                                                                                                                                     |
| rac   |    | Routing area code  Must be sent to the MME to uniquely be able to identify the target SGSN in the target location area of the target TD-SCDMA cell. |

For a TD-SCDMA cell

ExternalUtranCellTDD

Managed Object (MO) instance that is created by an operator

(that is, manually) it is expected that the values for the

rac

and

lac

parameters are filled in at creation of the MO instance.

This is not mandated, but very much recommended.

## 7.4 Configure for Blind TD-SCDMA Handover

To indicate that blind handover can be used for this TD-SCDMA target

frequency, the operator must configure the RBS in the following ways:

- The covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG attribute for the serving cell must be set to the value true.
- The mobilityAction TOOLTIPFLAG attribute must have the value HANDOVER for the UtranTDDFreqRelation TOOLTIPFLAG MO representing the target frequency under the source cell in the Managed Object Model (MOM).
- There must be a UtranCellRelation TOOLTIPFLAG below the UtranTDDFreqRelation TOOLTIPFLAG target that indicates a cell that is covering the serving cell completely, and therefore is safe to send the UE to from the serving cell without measuring. This is achieved in the UtranCellRelation TOOLTIPFLAG by setting the coverageIndicator TOOLTIPFLAG attribute to the value COVERS. Also, the isHoAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG attribute must have the value true. This cell relation represents the target cell in the resulting blind handover.

## 7.5 Configure for Measurement-Based TD-SCDMA Handover

When the RBS has selected a TD-SCDMA frequency as a candidate target for transferring the UE,

the RBS will check whether the UE should be transferred there with a blind release with

redirect, a blind handover, or whether a B2 measurement should be started in the UE. If the

decision is to start a B2 measurement, the RBS will wait for the resulting report and then

decide whether the UE should be transferred to the target frequency with a release with

redirect, or a handover to one of the cells included in the measurement report.

To indicate that measurement-based handover can be used for this

TD-SCDMA target frequency, the operator must configure the RBS in

the following ways:

- If the feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is active the ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN TOOLTIPFLAG attribute must be set to the value true. Otherwise, the ueMeasurementsActive TOOLTIPFLAG attribute must be set to the value true.
- The mobilityAction TOOLTIPFLAG attribute must have the value HANDOVER for the UtranTDDFreqRelation TOOLTIPFLAG MO representing the target TD-SCDMA frequency under the source cell in the MOM.
- For every cell that should be possible to use as a target cell, there must be a UtranCellRelation TOOLTIPFLAG below the UtranTDDFreqRelation TOOLTIPFLAG target where the isHoAllowed TOOLTIPFLAG attribute has the value true.
