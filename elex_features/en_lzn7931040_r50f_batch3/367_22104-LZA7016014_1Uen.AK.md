Hardware

This feature is only supported on 8TX/8RX radio units.

Limitations

The TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature is only supported for

TDD.

Transport block size index 33A is not supported.

Network Requirements

The UE must support eight CSI-RS ports in TM9 with a maximum of four layers.

It is recommended to activate the TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package

feature if there is at least 20% of TM9 traffic penetration.

# 3 Feature Operation of TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The feature enables the reconfiguration of the UE to TM9 8x4.

This feature supports TM9 with up to four layers transmission in TDD. Over the four

dual-polarized antenna arrays in the eNodeB, TM9 gets higher beamforming gain over TDD

specific TM8 and

TM7.

In TM9 DCI format 2C is used to schedule one or two PDSCH codewords on antenna ports 7

to 14.

Figure 1   TM9 Principle of 8TX and 4RX Use

Figure 2   TM9 over Four Dual-Polarized Antenna Arrays

In TM9 the eNodeB is configured with two CRSs, 8-port CSI-RSs, and a supported TDD

configuration. DMRS is only transmitted if there is a TM9 UE in the cell.

When the UE makes an initial connection in TM3 or TM7 for 8TX/8RX, the eNodeB retrieves

the UE capabilities through RRC signaling (FGI bits). The eNodeB initiates a switch to

TM9 8x4 by reconfiguring the UE through RRC if the following pre-conditions are

fulfilled:

- The UE is capable of TM9 with 8-port CSI-RS (FGI 104 = true).
- Periodic CSI sub-mode is supported (FGI 109 or 110 = true).
- The number of TX antennas is eight.
- The number of supported layers of the UE category is four.
- The transmission mode is enabled (controlled by license).

Process Steps

Figure 3   TM9 MIMO Operation

1. The eNodeB sends out CSI-RS symbols through the eight antennas.
2. The UE estimates CSI based on CSI-RS symbols from the eNodeB.
3. Based on the feedback from the UE, the eNodeB calculates the beamforming weights on antenna port 7, 8, 9, and 10.
4. The eNodeB dynamically schedules data on one to four layers. The number of used layers depends on the following factors:
    - CSI report, which includes for example CQI, PMI, and rank indicator.
    - HARQ feedback information. See 3GPP 36.213 for more details about retransmissions.
    - Low rank is used because of only one codeword transmission, for example, if the amount of new data is too little.

# 4 Network Impact of TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The TM9 8x4 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature affects UEs that comply

with release standards earlier than Release 10 negatively, and can positively affect the

downlink throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The CSI-RS overhead reduces peak rates if there is no Release 10 UE in the

network.

UEs that comply with release standards earlier than Release 10 are negatively

affected because they are not aware of the CSI-RS in the CSI-RS subframe. The degree

of degradation depends on the CSI-RS periodicity and on the selected

systemization.

The throughput of the UEs is decreased if the UE configured with TM9 is not

monitoring the CSI-RS during TRX sleep time, resulting in inaccurate CSI

reports.

The DL Throughput KPI is positively affected if there are many TM9 8x4 UEs in the

network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 18.01 is needed for updated counters and events.
