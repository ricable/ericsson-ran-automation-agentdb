# 1 Intelligent Power Emission Control Overview

The Intelligent Power Emission Control feature monitors and controls the sector

carrier-wide, time averaged radiated power of the LTE classic and AAS radio. The purpose of

this feature is to keep the sector carrier-wide, time averaged radiated power below a

configurable level. This level is determined by the operator in order to meet EMF regulatory

requirements when the radio is deployed at a site.

Summary

The Intelligent Power Emission Control feature adds support to control the average radiated

power over a certain time period. This allows compliance with radio frequency EMF

exposure requirements present in most markets. The operator can configure the

maximum time averaged power at a level determined to obtain a certain radio

frequency EMF exclusion zone while affecting performance and capacity as little as

possible.

Hardware

The feature is not compatible with Baseband 6621.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- The radiated power is estimated and computed in the Baseband unit.
- Power calculation is performed on a sector carrier level for LTE only.
- Beamforming gain and power boost are not considered while computing time averaged radiated power. Only PDSCH resources that are limited and beamforming gain is taken into account when calculating the resulting radio frequency EMF exclusion zones based on the configured averaged radiated power.
- The following bandwidths are not supported: 1.4 MHz 3 MHz
- The Intelligent Power Emission Control feature is not supported on eNodeBs configured with two LTE capacity modules in a mixed mode configuration.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Intelligent Power Emission Control

The feature measures and controls the time averaged power emission on the sector carrier

level by limiting resource use for PDSCH.

The feature operates as a continuous loop of output power measurements and power control.

The loop is made up of control steps. Each of the feature operation steps occurs

simultaneously at every control step. If multiple sectors in the cell are used, this is

done for all sectors separately. However the final backoff power determination for the

entire Baseband unit is taken once per cell from all sectors. The emitted power levels

are controlled by dynamically limiting the use of downlink PDSCH resources based on

continuous monitoring.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Continuous Power Measurement and

Control

1. The Baseband unit determines the transmitted power at a regular time interval (at each control step). The transmitted power measurements are taken and calculated in the Baseband unit.
2. The amount of transmitted power is sampled and added to a sliding window. The sliding window holds a set of previously taken samples. The PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime attribute controls the length of this window in time. An average of all the currently held samples is calculated along with an estimate of the momentary power a transmission without restrictions can require.
3. The following inputs are used to determine the backoff amount. The total transmitted power threshold controlled by the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute over the average time configured by the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime attribute. The average of the sliding window samples
4. If the time averaged transmitted power exceeds the configured threshold, power backoff is used. The PDSCH power is dynamically controlled by limiting the used resources. Limiting PDSCH resource use allows to control momentary output power and time averaged output power.

## 3.1 Power Estimation

The Intelligent Power Emission Control feature uses a two-part estimation of the

output power for EMF power control.

Power estimation is based on the following values:

- The unavoidable amount of downlink control power.
- The dynamically adjusted power determined by the Intelligent Power Emission Control feature.

The unavoidable amount of downlink power emission refers to the emission caused by

transmitting the following elements:

- Control channels
- Reference signals
- A certain amount of resources required by data transmission of system information. Examples of such system information can be the following data: SIB SI RA Paging

The exact amount of control power is based on the network configuration. This power stays

constant during operation. It depends on the following aspects of the network:

- Number of antennas (1, 2, or 4)
- CFI mode selected (1-3)
- Cell bandwidth

For optimal performance and power management, it is recommended to configure the

PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute to a value higher than

the minimum amount of unavoidable power transmissions. To configure the threshold

properly, it is important to subtract the amount of unavoidable power from the total

allowed downlink power.

# 4 Network Impact of Intelligent Power Emission Control

The feature dynamically limits the resources for data traffic in the Baseband unit to

remain below the configured amount of output power. As a result, it has a minimal effect on

downlink throughput. Coverage is not affected by the feature.

Capacity and Performance

Due to power backoff, a reduction in capacity and throughput is possible on traffic

channels, while coverage remains unaffected. The reduction occurs in case of high

traffic load, when the time averaged transmitted power is expected to exceed the

configured threshold. The system continuously reevaluates power backoff to minimize

the impact on capacity, cell performance, and throughput.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Intelligent Power Emission Control

The feature introduces power backoff attributes. These attributes control the time

periods for measurement and the thresholds under which the EMF power levels must be kept.

The feature also interacts with attributes related to PDSCH resource use

restriction.

# 6 Performance of Intelligent Power Emission Control

The feature introduces PM counters and a PM event to monitor the transmitted average

power and the extent of power backoff when it is

active.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffDynResThrDistr
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffHardLimit
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffPwrDistr
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffOnPwrDistr
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffSamp
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDistr
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffSum
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffSumOn
- SectorCarrier.pmRadioTxPowerMaxConfigured

The value read from the

SectorCarrier.pmRadioTxPowerMaxConfigured counter can show

some difference when compared to the value set for the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. This is because

the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute is configured in

mW units. Using the configured value, the maximum possible power output at an

antenna reference point (ARP) is indicated in 0.1 dBm units by the

SectorCarrier.maximumTransmissionPower read-only attribute.

The value in mW units read from the

SectorCarrier.pmRadioTxPowerMaxConfigured counter is

converted from the value of the

SectorCarrier.maximumTransmissionPower attribute in the

current ROP. The conversion is based on the following formula:

If the SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

attribute is changed in the ROP the

SectorCarrier.pmRadioTxPowerMaxConfigured

counter is set to the peak value of all the changes that happened

during that ROP.

Events

The INTERNAL\_PER\_SECTORCARRIER\_EMF\_POWER\_CONTROL PM event is used for

tracking power and control state in each control step.

The associated PM event parameters reflect values of power backoff control. The scope

of the following event parameters applies to the given cell:

- pmEventPbAvgPow
- pmEventPbStatusTrue
- pmEventPbOnOffTrig
- pmEventPbResThr
- pmEventPbOnAvgPow
- pmEventPbStepPow
- pmEventPbSamp
- pmEventPbHardLimit

# 7 Activate Intelligent Power Emission Control

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure, followed by the creation of the MO instance specific to the feature. This MO

instance must be configured when it is created.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012486 MO instance.
2. Configure the attributes of the PowerBackoff MO instance when creating it. To set new attribute values, the MO instance must be deleted and recreated. The attribute values become fixed after making the initial configuration. This is to limit the risk of accidental changes and violating EMF regulations.
    1. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffEnabled attribute to true.
    2. Configure the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime and the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attributes based on the averaging time of applicable EMF regulations and determined power threshold.
3. Lock and unlock the cell to complete the activation process.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Intelligent Power Emission Control

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated in the feature state MO and

then by locking and unlocking the cell. It must also be deactivated before the activation of

any conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012486 MO instance.
2. Delete all existing instances of the PowerBackoff MO.
3. Lock and unlock the cell for complete deactivation of the feature in the cell. Note: The PowerBackoff MO attributes are restricted. This means that they can only be set, when the MO is created. To change them, the MO must be deleted and re-created. This is done to limit the risk of accidental changes of the attributes that could cause the violation of the EMF regulations. None of the parameter changes take effect until the next sector carrier unlock.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Intelligent Power Emission Control

The measurement and power backoff functions of the feature can be configured. This

can affect cell throughput.

The configuration of the feature is determined by the following attributes:

- PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime
- PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh
- SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

The PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime

attribute is the EMF limit averaging time. The averaging time is specified in the

applicable EMF regulation for the carrier frequency associated with the sector carrier

(for example six

minutes).

The PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThreshattribute is the percentage of the maximum

power of the radio that is used for exclusion zone design or EMF requirement compliance

at a site. The potential impact on throughput and cell performance becomes increasingly

more noticeable the lower the value of the

PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute is set. The feature

only regulates PDSCH power by means of PRB limitation, PDCCH is left

unaffected.

The SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute is the maximum power

of the radio (for example 20 W). The PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh

attribute is configured in the percentage of the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute.

Power Backoff Threshold Configuration

For an optimal power backoff function and performance, it is recommended to set the

PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh

attribute to a value higher than the minimum power. This value is based on the

network configuration and on the power output of reference signals and control

channels that are always scheduled.

Table 3 shows values that apply to an FDD

cell:

Observability without Power Backoff

When the PowerBackoff MO is created and the Intelligent Power

Emission Control feature is disabled, the observability of the power distribution is

still possible. In such a case, the following configurations must be made:

1. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffEnabled attribute to False.
2. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute to 1000.
3. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime attribute to any value that power distribution aims to estimate (for example, 6 minutes).

With this configuration, the observability of the power distribution can be made with

the following PM counters:

- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffPwrDistr
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDistr
- SectorCarrier. pmEmfPwrBackoffSamp
- SectorCarrier. pmRadioTxPowerMaxConfigured

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces interaction between the Intelligent Power Emission

Control and Carrier Aggregation features. The feature enhancement enables predicting

and controlling the power density to comply with EIRP exposure regulations for the

separated sector or cell. Global SCell Evaluation is updated with a modified

algorithm for bandwidth factor based on the power limitations for SCell selection or

reselection. This improves Carrier Aggregation throughput when the number of PRBs is

limited by the Intelligent Power Emission Control feature.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The Intelligent Power Emission Control feature can keep the network compliant with EIRP exposure regulations and simultaneously coexist with the Carrier Aggregation feature.
- The Global SCell Evaluation feature is updated with an enhanced algorithm for bandwidth factor to improve UE throughput when the number of PRBs is limited by power backoff.

Capacity and Performance

Carrier Aggregation throughput is increased. This also increases the Average DL PDCP

UE Throughput for Carrier Aggregation KPI.

The following PM counters can be used for further observation of the performance

improvement:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbCa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbLastTTICa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpTimeDlCa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbCa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbLastTTICa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpTimeDlCa
- SectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffDynResThrDistr

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.ipecPrbCycles
- EUtranCellFDD.ipecGseEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.ipecGseEnabled

The EUtranCellFDD.IpecGseEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.IpecGseEnabled MO attribute must be set to

true for using the enhanced algorithm for bandwidth factor of

the Global SCell Evaluation feature.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement introduces X2AP private extension messages to request, and

report the number of available PRBs from external cells, which is reduced by the

Intelligent Power Emission Control feature.
