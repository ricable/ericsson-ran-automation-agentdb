# 1 Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility Overview

This feature detects UEs with high uplink traffic and moves them to cells with higher

uplink capacity to improve throughput.

Summary

This feature enables the eNodeB to evaluate the continuous uplink traffic of UEs and

to flag UEs as uplink-heavy. If there are neighboring cells with higher uplink

capacity, the feature uses A5 measurements to find a cell that can better serve the

uplink throughput demand of the UEs. If a suitable cell is available, the eNodeB

triggers UE handover towards the cell.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved uplink throughput for uplink-heavy UEs
- Improved utilization of the uplink capacity of the network by moving uplink-heavy users to cells with higher uplink capacity

The main use case for the feature is a TDD-FDD mixed network because TDD cells have

typically lower uplink capacity than FDD cells. If the Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover

and the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility features are both enabled, the

uplink-heavy UEs are moved from the TDD cells to the FDD cells in mixed

networks.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility

The feature detects uplink-heavy UEs and uses measurement-based handover to direct these

UEs to cells with higher uplink capacity.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

The high-level operation of the feature consists of the following steps:

1. Uplink-Heavy UE Detection The node periodically probes the estimated buffer size of UEs to search for uplink-heavy UEs. If the buffer size is above a configured threshold, it detects the UE as uplink-heavy. If the buffer size of an uplink-heavy UE falls under a configured threshold, it considers it as not uplink-heavy.
2. Frequency Selection After a UE is detected as uplink-heavy, the node selects candidate frequencies for UE measurements.
3. Uplink-Heavy Measurement Configuration If there are selected frequency candidates, and the UE has no voice bearer, uplink-heavy measurement is configured. If the UE has voice bearers, no measurement is configured. But if the voice bearer is released, and the UE is still considered uplink-heavy, measurement is configured. UEs with voice bearers are not considered by this feature in order to not decrease the quality of the voice service with the uplink-heavy triggered handovers. Voice bearers can be VoLTE or PTT bearers.
4. Uplink-Heavy Measurement Deconfiguration If no measurement report is received until the node determines the UE as not uplink-heavy during the uplink-heavy UE detection process, the measurement is deconfigured. If the UE remains uplink-heavy, but a voice bearer is set up, the measurement is also deconfigured.
5. Uplink-Heavy Handover After the measurement report is received, the node selects the best target cell and triggers handover to it.

Uplink-Heavy UE Detection

For the uplink-heavy UE detection, the node uses thresholds determined by the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh and

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst attributes.

The eNodeB probes the estimated buffer size of each UE periodically. If the buffer

size is higher than the sum of ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh

and ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst, a detection window is

started. If the buffer size remains higher than this threshold condition during the

detection window, the UE is detected as uplink-heavy by the node. If the UE does not

fulfill the uplink-heavy criterion, the node continues the periodic probing.

For a UE that is detected as uplink-heavy, the periodic probing starts again after an

internal timer runs out. If the estimated buffer size is lower than the difference

of ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh and

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst, a detection window starts.

If the buffer size remains lower than this threshold condition during the detection

window, the UE is detected as not uplink-heavy by the node. If the UE does not

fulfill the non-uplink-heavy criterion, the node continues the periodic probing and

continues to consider the UE as uplink-heavy.

Figure 2   Buffer Size Thresholds for Uplink-Heavy UE Detection

Frequency Selection

After a UE is detected as uplink-heavy, the node selects the measurement frequencies

for the UE. The node considers the following criteria for the selection:

- If the RFPM function of the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is active, and the UE has a SPID value, the frequency priority for it is modified. The node compares the configuration of the RATFreqPrio and EUtranFreqRelation MOs and uses the intersection of the two to determine the frequencies to be used for measurement and handover.
- EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction must be set to HANDOVER for the selected frequency.
- Frequencies with EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio set to -1 are not selected for UE measurements.
- The UE Capability must support the selected frequency band and the inter-frequency measurement and handover towards that band.
- Inter-mode frequency relations (between TDD and FDD) are only considered if the Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover feature is activated, and the UE Capability supports inter-mode handover.
- The selected frequency must be allowed by the Handover Restriction List.
- EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed and EUtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus must be set to true for at least one neighbor cell in the selected frequency.

The node calculates the uplink cell peak throughput of the frequencies that fulfill

the criteria. Those frequencies can be considered for the uplink-heavy measurement,

where

| ulCellCapCoeff   |    | The value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCellCapCoeff or                                 the EUtranCellTDD.ulCellCapCoeff attribute.   |
|------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                  |    |                                                                                                                                |
| CPTsource        |    | The uplink cell peak throughput of the source cell.                                                                            |

If too many frequencies fulfill all criteria to be candidate frequencies, the node

selects subset of them to avoid high load because of too many measurements by the

UE.

Uplink-Heavy Measurement Configuration and Deconfiguration

The uplink-heavy measurement uses the same configurations as other A5 measurements,

but with different parameters. For the uplink-heavy measurement, attributes of the

ReportConfigA5UlTraffic MO are used.

The UeMeasControl.a5MobilityTimerUlTraffic timer controls the

duration of the uplink-heavy measurement. The measurement is deconfigured when this

timer expires and the uplink-heavy handover process is not triggered until that

time.

Uplink-Heavy Handover

After receiving the measurement report, the node selects the target cell using the

following tests:

- Select the cell with the highest uplink cell peak throughput.
- If the cell peak throughput values are equal, select the cell with the best RSRP or RSRQ, depending on which is set as the trigger quantity of the A5 Event.
- If the RSRP or RSRQ values are equal, select one frequency randomly or use the UeMeasControl.bothRsrpRsrqCheckUlTraffic attribute to check both RSRP and RSRQ conditions before triggering the uplink-heavy handover process. Enabling this attribute can prevent handover oscillation with the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature. Beamforming for PDSCH contributes to interference in CRS symbols. This causes RSRQ to decrease for AAS, as the RSRQ estimation of UEs is affected. Because of this, using RSRP is recommended for features related to mobility and load balancing.

After the target cell is selected, the node triggers handover to it.

Following the uplink-heavy handover, no uplink-heavy measurement is configured until

an internal timer runs out. This prevents the UE from being handed over immediately

after the previous handover.

The feature operation for EN-DC-capable UEs is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility Support for EN-DC-Capable UEs

For those EN-DC-capable UEs that trigger uplink-heavy handover, the uplink-heavy handover

process is also modified to target a neighbor cell of an EN-DC-capable cell.

The UE is allowed to enter the EN-DC setup if all the following conditions are

fulfilled:

- The Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature is activated on the serving cell.
- The Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature is activated for the IMEISV profile of the user.
- At least one of the Serving or Equivalent PLMN identities listed in the HRL match one of the identities configured in the following MOs for the primary LTE cell: EUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList EUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList
- At least one of the band combinations of the EN-DC setup is supported by the UE.

If at least one of these conditions is missing, the UE is not allowed to enter the EN-DC

setup. In this case, the UE can still enter the EN-DC-triggered handover process if all

of the following conditions are true:

- All the following features are activated on the serving cell: EN-DC-Triggered Handover during Setup EN-DC-Triggered Handover during Connected Mode Mobility
- At least one EN-DC-capable neighbor cell is available.

If at least one of these conditions is missing, the UE is not allowed to enter the

EN-DC-triggered handover process.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility

The feature improves the uplink throughput of the network, but does not take the

downlink capacity into account. It uses new private IEs in S1 and X2 messages for

uplink-heavy handovers.

Capacity and Performance

By handing over uplink-heavy UEs to cells with higher uplink capacity, the average UE

and cell uplink throughput is improved. But the feature does not take the downlink

capacity into account, which can lead to degradation in the downlink throughput.

Interfaces

- S1 Interface A new Ericsson private IE is added to the Source eNodeB to Target eNodeB Transparent Container. This IE is transmitted for uplink-heavy handovers.
- X2 Interface A new Ericsson private IE is added to the X2 Handover Request. This IE is transmitted for uplink-heavy handovers.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility

Enable QCI-1 Level Mobility with Offset

When the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature and the Multi-Layer

Service-Triggered Mobility features are activated, the priority for QCI-1 must be

higher than for QCI-5. This is done by setting the

QciProfilePredefined.priority attribute value of QCI-1 and

QCI-5 respectively.

For example, if the value of the QciProfilePredefined.priority

attribute for QCI-1 is 2, and the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.priority attribute for QCI-5 is

1, the following must be done:

- For QCI-1, the QciProfilePredefined.priority attribute must be set to 1.

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 10.1 21.Q4: Enhanced Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility

This feature enhancement improves the uplink-heavy handover process for EN-DC-capable

UEs and improves the measurement handling of uplink-heavy UEs.

| Feature Name:           | Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5044                        |
| Value Package Name:     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0409                        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                 |

Summary and Benefits

The enhancement disables the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature for those

EN-DC-capable UEs that are allowed to enter the EN-DC setup or the EN-DC triggered

handover process. For those EN-DC-capable UEs that are not allowed to enter the

EN-DC setup or the EN-DC-triggered handover process, the enhancement modifies the

uplink-heavy handover process to target a neighbor cell of an EN-DC-capable

cell.

The enhancement also improves the measurement handling of uplink-heavy UEs by

introducing a timer to limit the duration of A5 measurements.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved downlink and uplink throughput for uplink-heavy UEs
- Increased number of EN-DC-capable UEs in RRC connected mode

The benefits of the enhancement can be best observed when there is a large number of

users in heavy uplink traffic in the NR NSA deployment.

Capacity and Performance

The downlink and uplink throughput of uplink-heavy UEs is improved. This improvement

can be observed with the following KPIs:

- Average DL PDCP UE Throughput
- Average UL PDCP UE Throughput

The number of RRC connected EN-DC-capable UEs is increased in the primary cell. This

improvement can be observed with the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnMaxEndc0
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnMaxEndc0
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnMaxEndc2
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnMaxEndc2

The number of uplink-heavy handovers can decrease because this process is not

triggered for those UEs that are allowed to enter the EN-DC setup or the EN-DC

triggered handover process. This change can be observed with the following

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic

Operation

The enhancement introduces the

UeMeasControl.a5MobilityTimerUlTraffic attribute. This timer

ensures that A5 measurements are removed from uplink-heavy UEs as soon as possible

if the uplink-heavy handover process is not triggered by the feature.

The enhancement also introduces the

UeMeasControl.bothRsrpRsrqCheckUlTraffic attribute to check

both RSRP and RSRQ before triggering the uplink-heavy handover process.

The enhancement introduces the following counters to better observe the measurement

reports of the feature:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUlTrafficA5MeasRepUe
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUlTrafficA5MeasRepUe
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUlTrafficQualifiedUe
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUlTrafficQualifiedUe

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 21.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

## 10.2 23.Q4: Improved Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility for EN-DC Handling

This feature enhancement improves the configuration flexibility for EN-DC-capable

UEs.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves configuration flexibility to disable the

Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature for the following conditions:

- EN-DC-capable UEs that are allowed to enter the EN-DC setup or the EN-DC-triggered handover process
- EN-DC-capable UEs that are EN-DC-configured

Capacity and Performance

The number of uplink-heavy handovers might increase if all EN-DC-capable UEs can

trigger the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature.

The number of uplink-heavy handovers might decrease if the Uplink-Traffic-Triggered

Mobility feature is disabled only for the EN-DC-configured UEs.

This change can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoExeAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoExeSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFUlTraffic

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.uttmCtrlForEndcUe
- EUtranCellTDD.uttmCtrlForEndcUe

The Uplink-Traffic-Triggered Mobility feature is enabled or disabled for

EN-DC-capable UEs depending on the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.uttmCtrlForEndcUe or the

EUtranCellTDD.uttmCtrlForEndcUe MO attribute.
