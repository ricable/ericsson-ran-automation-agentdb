# 1 Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data Overview

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature allows header

compression of

TCP/IP packets (ROHC profile 6) in uplink direction with good efficiency for low and medium

speed links and traffic characteristics where payload size is comparable to the actual

header size.

Summary

The feature improves uplink capacity and throughput in specific traffic conditions.

Examples for suitable data traffic flows are video streaming and long duration FTP

sessions where average packet size in uplink direction does not exceed 100 bytes.

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature has the following benefits:

- Increased uplink radio resource efficiency by sending the same information with fewer bits in uplink direction
- Increased uplink and downlink throughput by reducing the amount of data sent to Transmission Control Protocol Acknowledgments (TCP ACKs) required for downlink data in specific scenarios

| Robust Header Compression (FAJ 121 0892)      | Related        | Depending on UE capabilities, a single UE is allowed to use both                                 Robust Header Compression and Uplink Robust Header Compression for                                 Data features simultaneously however not on the same bearer.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The number of TCP/IP flows with compression allowed at setup is limited to 2 on any

data radio bearer, additional flows are sent to fast uncompressed paths. To avoid

internal resource congestion, the eNB has a protection mechanism available to force

switching off Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data on any TCP/IP flow if high

density or unsuitable average packet size is detected.

Network Requirements

ENM 19.12 or later is required for PM observability.

UE is required to support ROHC profile 6.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data compresses TCP/IP headers and needs the

right QCI settings applied to take

effect.

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature operation has the following

characteristics:

- Provides ROHC profile 6 support for TCP/IP transmission
- Expected average compression gain exceeds 90% for IPv4/TCP and IPv6/TCP headers however overall result depends on the payload characteristics.
- Does not interfere with existing VoIP services like VoLTE and Mission Critical Push to Talk that are already using robust header compression.

Operational Process

Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data only compresses TCP/IP headers, so it

should be used for data radio bearers which are expected to carry packets with such

headers.

The QciProfilePredefined.rohcForUlDataEnabled or the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.rohcForUlDataEnabled attributes

needs to be set to TRUE for the QCIs of those radio bearers that

use Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data.

Protection Mechanism

Packet processing using Robust Header Compression requires more memory and processor

resources from uncompressed regular packet processing thus Uplink Robust Header

Compression for Data employs an internal protection mechanism built in to avoid

negative impact on eNB characteristics.

The protection mechanism has the following characteristics:

- Internal resource monitoring
- VoLTE user load monitoring
- data radio bearer admission
- TCP/IP flow change detection
- Unsuitable flow rejection and de-configuration

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature increases uplink radio efficiency

and uplink and downlink throughput in specific scenarios and has an impact on the RRC

protocol.

Capacity and Performance

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature has the following impacts on

the network performance:

- Increased uplink radio resource efficiency by sending the same information using fewer bits in uplink direction.
- Increased uplink and downlink throughput by reducing the amount of data sent to TCP ACKs required for downlink data in specific scenarios.

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature has

potential

impacts

in

certain heavy traffic load

conditions.

A limited data packet loss is expected because of packet prioritization and actions

taken by the feature functionality to protect the QoS of existing VoIP

services.

Interfaces

The Uplink Robust Header Compression for Data feature is only used by UEs which

support profile0x0006-r14 with value TRUE under

supportedUplinkOnlyROHC-Profiles-r14 information element as

described in 3GPP specification 36.331.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
