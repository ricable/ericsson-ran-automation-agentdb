# 1 PLMN-Specific Access Barring Overview

The feature allows to differentiate access barring configuration based on PLMNs in the

cell. The feature also enables to configure progressive access barring for

PLMNs.

Summary

The PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature introduces the possibility to prioritize access

barring of UEs based on their PLMN during severe system overload. The feature can

adjust access barring automatically as the system overload changes.

The feature increases the chance that the UEs belonging to a prioritized PLMN can enter the

network more easily than the UEs belonging to a non-prioritized PLMN. This can be

useful when the prioritized PLMNs are used as a public safety network and share

cells with other PLMNs.

With the feature, up to three different access barring configurations can be provided

in the cell, for different PLMNs.

The feature allows the following functions and configurations:

- Manual access class barring configuration
- Progressive barring of PLMNs by defining priority relations between PLMNs, both for standard and special access classes
- Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring feature is possible per PLMN

# 2 Dependencies of PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The feature can benefit only in cells where multiple PLMNs are served. The feature

has dependencies to load management and other access barring features.

## 2.1 Compatibility of Load Balancing and Automatic Access Barring

During ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, inter-frequency

load balancing for incoming handover is disabled in the cell.

When automatic access class barring is used together with Inter-Frequency Load Balancing,

the incoming handover to an overloaded cell is disabled.

Inter-frequency load balancing is enabled in the cell when the barring probability

reaches 0.

If load balancing during access class barring is enabled, that is

EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true, the

following events occur:

- The subscription ratio measurements are still ongoing in the cell when the automatic access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered.
- The function enables the cell for outgoing load balancing handover, and a faster recovery from overload.
- Triggering of the access class barring calculation mechanism does not disable subscription ratio evaluation and Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, by setting

the PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute to

true, and the cell is configured as

priority cell, triggering of the access class barring calculation

mechanism does not disable the following events:

- Subscription ratio evaluation
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload

A cell is configured as priority cell if the following is true:

- PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY.
- The EUtranCellFDD.ptmCellProfileRef or the EUtranCellTDD.ptmCellProfileRef reference to a cell profile is set as priority.

Example 1   Automatic Access Class Barring Disables

Load Balancing

Figure 1   Inter-Frequency Load Management Disabled by Automatic Access Barring

The following events occur during the access class barring calculation

mechanism:

1. Before t1, inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled.
2. At t1, these load balancing functions are disabled, and automatic access class barring calculation is enabled.
3. Between t1 and t4, until the automatic access class barring calculation is enabled, the load balancing functions remain disabled.
4. At t4, the barring probability reaches its minimum value, that is 0. Inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled again.
5. Between t5 and t6, inter-frequency load balancing is disabled again.
6. Between t6 and t7, outgoing inter-frequency load balancing is enabled only if EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true.
7. At t7, the barring probability reaches its minimum value again. Inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload are enabled again.

# 3 Feature Operation of PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The feature introduces the possibility to prioritize access class barring of UEs based

on their PLMN during severe system overload. The feature extends the operation of the

Load-Based Access Barring, the Progressive Access Barring, and the Progressive Barring for

Special Access Classes features.

The feature offers the following automatic access class barring functionalities depending

on the activated licenses and MOM configuration:

- PLMN Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN Progressive Access Barring
- Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring
- PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes
- Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

The feature also provides the possibility to skip access barring check for VoLTE services

for certain PLMN.

## 3.1 Definition of Access Classes

The access class of the UE is stored on the USIM. This information is tied to the

mobile subscription.

All UEs with a USIM are members of one of 10 randomly allocated classes, defined as access

classes 0-9.

In addition, a UE can be a member of one or more of the five special categories, defined as

access classes 11-15.

In accordance with 3GPP TS 22.011, the following access classes allocated to

specific user categories:

- Class 15: PLMN staff
- Class 14: Emergency Services
- Class 13: Public Utilities
- Class 12: Security Services
- Class 11: For PLMN Use

Access class 10 is an independent class especially designed for emergency calls barring. It

enables network access control if emergency calls are allowed for UEs with access classes 0-9

or without an IMSI. For UEs with access classes 11-15, emergency calls are not allowed if both

access class 10 and any of the relevant access classes 11-15 are barred. Otherwise, emergency

calls are allowed.

Access classes 0-9 apply in any home or visited PLMN. Access classes 11 and 15 apply to the

home PLMN and any equivalent home PLMN. Access classes 12-14 apply to any home PLMN or visited

PLMN in the home country of the mobile subscription. The home country is defined by the Mobile

Country Code (MCC) part of the IMSI. The IMSI is stored on the USIM.

## 3.2 Automatic Access Class Barring Operation

Automatic access class barring monitors the ratio between RRC Connection

Rejects and RRC Connection Attempts and activates or

deactivates access class barring parameters in SIB2 messages. Automatic access

class                 barring uses barring information from SIB2 broadcast messages to inform UEs about

the congestion level in the system.

Access class barring starts to operate when the access class barring calculation

mechanism is triggered by the following conditions being true:

- The ratio between RRC Connection Rejects and RRC Connection Attempts is above EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh or EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh for a time interval EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh or EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh.
- The intensity of the RRC Connection Requests is higher than the minimum intensity.

During ongoing access class barring calculation mechanism, the following applies to

all access attempt types the presence of which is set to AUTO:

- The barring factor (1 - barring probability) for the common or the PLMN-specific access class barring parameter for the access attempt type is included in the next SIB2 broadcast message.
- Barring probability for the access attempt type is changed periodically, based on the measured load in the cell and the MOM configuration.
- If a UE attempts to connect to the cell and it can be barred based on its access class and access attempt type, access class barring is applied to the UE. UEs are informed about access class barring parameters in SIB2 broadcast messages.
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and subscription ratio measurements are disabled for the cell if the following criteria is fulfilled: Preferential Traffic Management is disabled, or the cell is not configured as a priority cell. Load balancing during access class barring is disabled.

Automatic access class barring calculation is continued

until no congestion is detected.

Barring Factor Change

When the access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered, barring probability

is increased by EUtranCellFDD.lbabIncr or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabIncr.

During the ongoing access class barring calculation mechanism, barring

probability is changed every EUtranCellFDD.lbabPeriod or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabPeriod depending on the relation

between the traffic load and LBAB thresholds, and the barring trend.

Timers

EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh

or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh

and

EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeLow

or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeLow

are used to check the RRC Connection Reject ratio

whenever an automatic access class barring

functionality runs.

When the barring probability reached its maximum-the configured minimum

barring factor-the barring factor is not changed until the conditions for

decreasing it are fulfilled.

The barring factor (1 - barring probability) is updated in SIB2, and the updated

barring factor is included in the next SIB2 broadcast message.

## 3.3 PLMN Access Barring Profiles

With PLMN-Specific Access Barring, configuration profiles can be set for access

barring configuration per PLMN.

On a node, six different PLMN access barring configuration profiles can be set. Each

profile has its own PLMN ID for the corresponding PLMN.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles. The access

class             parameters defined by a referenced PLMN access barring profile are broadcast in SIB2

messages only if the PLMN ID of the profile is among the PLMNs served in the cell

(listed in EUtranCellFDD.activePlmnList or

EUtranCellTDD.activePlmnList).

## 3.4 Skipping Access Barring Check for VoLTE Services for Certain PLMN

With the Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring feature, UEs can be allowed to skip

access barring check when moving to connected mode due to establishing a VoLTE

service.

With the PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature, the skip can be configured per PLMN,

within PLMN-specific access barring configuration profiles.

The skip can be allowed for the following traffic classes separately, by setting the

relevant MOM attribute to true.

Table 3   Parameters for Skipping Access Barring

| Traffic Class                    | Common Configuration                                                               | PLMN-Specific Configuration                  |

## 3.5 Operational Process of PLMN Load-Based Access Barring

This functionality extends the Load-Based Access Barring algorithm to PLMN-specific

access barring parameters.

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

The functionality can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originating data
- Mobile originating signaling

The functionality is enabled when the access barring configuration is configured for at

least one of the traffic classes.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles.

When the access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered, barring probability is

increased by EUtranCellFDD.lbabIncr orEUtranCellTDD.lbabIncr.

Barring factor is changed in accordance with the automatic access barring mechanism.

## 3.6 Operational Process of PLMN Progressive Access Barring

This functionality extends the Progressive Access Barring algorithm to PLMN-specific

access barring parameters.

The functionality can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originating data
- Mobile originating signaling
- MMTel Video
- MMTel Voice

The functionality is enabled when the access barring configuration is configured for

at least one of the traffic classes.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles.

The common and the PLMN-specific access

barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic

classes.

The priority relations among traffic classes are defined by the Progressive Access

Barring configuration.

In Progressive Access Barring, five traffic priority levels can be used. The operator can

assign each traffic class to any priority level.

Figure 3   Barring Factor Change by Progressive Access Barring

Access class barring starts at the lowest priority level, traffic priority level

0.

When the barring probability reaches its maximum in a priority level, barring

probability starts to be changed in the next higher priority level.

While the barring probability is changed in a priority level, the barring probability

stays at its maximum value in each lower priority level.

When the barring probability reaches 0 in a priority level, barring probability

starts to be changed in the next lower priority level.

When the barring probability reaches 0 in priority level 0, access class barring

stops.

When the access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered, barring probability is

increased by EUtranCellFDD.lbabIncr orEUtranCellTDD.lbabIncr at traffic priority level 0.

Barring factor is changed in accordance with the automatic access barring mechanism.

## 3.7 Operational Process of Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring

This functionality extends the Progressive Access Barring algorithm to PLMN-specific

access barring parameters with priority relations among PLMNs.

The functionality can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originating data
- Mobile originating signaling
- MMTel Video
- MMTel Voice

The functionality is enabled when the access barring configuration is configured for

at least one of the traffic classes.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

The common and the PLMN-specific access

barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic

classes.

Hence, the priority relations among traffic

classes are the same within each PLMN priority level. The priority

relations among traffic classes are defined by the Progressive

Access Barring configuration.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles.

For the functionality, each PLMN access barring profile can have its own priority

level. The PLMN priority levels can be of the following, in order of increasing

priority:

- Priority 0
- Priority 1
- Priority 2

Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes

assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN

priority level, the level is skipped.

The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the relevant

access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor

reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN

priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority

level.

Barring factor for the common access barring parameters follows that for the lowest

PLMN priority.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality applies the progressive

access barring algorithms.

Barring factor is changed in accordance with the automatic access barring mechanism..

Example 2   Two Prioritized PLMNs in PLMN-Specific

Access Barring Configuration

Figure 4   PLMN Priorities

Two PLMNs are differentiated using two PLMN priority levels. As illustrated, on

both PLMN priority level the priority relations among the traffic classes are the

same.

## 3.8 Operational Process of PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

This functionality extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature

to PLMN-specific access barring parameters.

The functionality can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originating data
- Mobile originating signaling
- MMTel Video
- MMTel Voice

The functionality is enabled when the access barring configuration is configured for

at least one of the traffic classes.

The functionality can be applied for special access classes-ranging from Access Class

10 to 15-in addition to standard access classes, ranging from Access Class 0 to

9.

The Special Access Classes are the following:

- 10: Emergency Calls
- 11: For PLMN Use
- 12: Security Services
- 13: Public Utilities
- 14: Emergency Services
- 15: PLMN Staff

Special access classes have different barring information from standard access

classes. For special access classes, barring information indicates only a barred or

not barred state.

Barring information of each special access class is decided in the following way,

based on current barring factor and priority level:

- If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.

Both standard access classes barring and special access classes barring have

dependency within the same traffic class. The UE monitors barring information of

special access classes only when barring factor of standard access classes is

set to zero. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331, Evolved Universal

Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC);

Protocol specification.

If the barring state of any special access class is set to barred, the barring

factor of the standard access class belonging to the corresponding traffic

class                     is automatically set to zero regardless of the configured minimum barring

factor.

Because of this dependency, the priority level of special access classes needs to

be set to higher than or equal to the priority level of standard access classes

within the same traffic class.

The priority relations among standard access classes of traffic classes is defined by the

Progressive Access Barring configuration. The priority relations among special access

classes are defined by the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

configuration.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles.

There is no priority relation between PLMNs.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard access classes and each special access class.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring parameters.

## 3.9 Operational Process of Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

This functionality extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature

to PLMN-specific access barring parameters with priority relations among PLMNs.

The functionality can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originating data
- Mobile originating signaling
- MMTel Video
- MMTel Voice

The functionality is enabled when the access barring configuration is configured for

at least one of the traffic classes.

The functionality can be applied for special access classes-ranging from Access Class

10 to 15-in addition to standard access classes, ranging from Access Class 0 to

9.

The Special Access Classes are the following:

- 10: Emergency Calls
- 11: For PLMN Use
- 12: Security Services
- 13: Public Utilities
- 14: Emergency Services
- 15: PLMN Staff

Special access classes have different barring information from standard access

classes. For special access classes, barring information indicates only a barred or

not barred state.

Barring information of each special access class is decided in the following way, based

on current PLMN priority level, barring factor, and priority level of special access

classes:

- If the configured PLMN priority (the applicable PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringPerPlmnPriority) is lower than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- If the configured PLMN priority (the applicable PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringPerPlmnPriority) is higher than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of the special access class is set to not barred.
- If the configured PLMN priority (the applicable PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringPerPlmnPriority) is equal to the current PLMN priority, the barring information of the special access class is based on current barring factor and priority level of the special access class: If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred. Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.

Both standard access classes barring and special access classes barring have

dependency within the same traffic class. The UE monitors barring information of

special access classes only when barring factor of standard access classes is

set to zero. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331, Evolved Universal

Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC);

Protocol specification.

If the barring state of any special access class is set to barred, the barring

factor of the standard access class belonging to the corresponding traffic

class                     is automatically set to zero regardless of the configured minimum barring

factor.

Because of this dependency, the priority level of special access classes needs to

be set to higher than or equal to the priority level of standard access classes

within the same traffic class.

The priority relations among standard access classes of traffic classes is defined by the

Progressive Access Barring configuration. The priority relations among special access

classes are defined by the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

configuration.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles.

For the functionality, each PLMN access barring profile can have its own priority

level. The PLMN priority levels can be of the following, in order of increasing

priority:

- Priority 0
- Priority 1
- Priority 2

Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes

assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN

priority level, the level is skipped.

The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the relevant

access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor

reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN

priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority

level.

Barring factor for the common access barring parameters follows that for the lowest

PLMN priority.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes functionality applies

the progressive barring for special access classes algorithms.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

Hence, the priority relations among standard and special access classes are the same

within each PLMN priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

## 3.10 Access Class Barring Functionalities

A variety of access class barring functionalities are available using different configurations  depending on the license states and the values of MOM attributes.

operation of this functionality depends only on MOM configuration, and it is independent of

the traffic load situation.

The Manual Access Class Barring functionality does not require any licensed feature.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are determined

for each traffic class based on the values of the corresponding MOM attributes.

Barring factors specified in MOM are broadcast in SIB2 messages only if the presence of

each traffic class in SIB2 is set to MANUAL. If the presence of a

traffic class in SIB2 is set to any other value-OFF or

AUTO-the AC-BarringConfig element for that traffic class is not

present in SIB2.

### 3.10.2 Load-Based Access Barring

Load-Based Access Barring is the basic automatic access class barring functionality.

The operation of this functionality depends on the traffic load situation.

The Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the Load-Based Access Barring

licensed feature is activated.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.10.3 PLMN Load-Based Access Barring

PLMN Load-Based Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. The operation of this functionality

depends on both the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access barring

configuration.

The PLMN Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access

barring configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.10.4 Progressive Access Barring

Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality that

extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. This functionality prioritizes the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

Access class barring in the common access class barring parameters starts for the traffic

classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. When the barring factor reaches

the minimum barring factor for a traffic priority level access class barring is

continued on the next higher priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.10.5 PLMN Progressive Access Barring

PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality takes the

PLMN-specific access barring configuration into account when prioritizing the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms so that the traffic classes in the PLMN-specific access barring parameters are also taken into account.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.10.6 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in addition to prioritizing the traffic

classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to

true.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN priority level, the level is skipped.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are set the same value for the traffic class as the barring factors for the traffic class on the lowest PLMN priority level.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.

### 3.10.7 Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the special access class in traffic classes in addition to prioritizing the

standard access classes.

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

If the presence of a traffic class of a special access class in SIB2 is set to

AUTO, the following applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.10.8 PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access

class         barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

feature. This functionality takes the PLMN-specific access barring configuration into

account when prioritizing the special access classes for access class barring.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

There is no priority relation between PLMNs.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

### 3.10.9 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic

access class barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access

Classes feature. This functionality prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in

addition to prioritizing the special access classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to true.

If the PLMN priority is lower than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to barred.

If the PLMN priority is higher than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to not barred.

If the PLMN priority is equal to the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set as follows:

- If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

Hence, the priority relations among standard and special access classes of traffic

classes are the same within each PLMN priority level. The priority relations among

standard and special access classes of traffic classes are defined by the Progressive

Barring for Special Access Classes configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature requires configuration to choose among its

access barring functionalities, and to control all the dependent access barring behavior in

the cell.

Enabling Prioritization of PLMN for Access Barring

When the PLMN-Specific Access Barring and the Progressive Access Barring or the

Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes features are activated together, the

setting of attribute EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled controls which

PLMN-specific progressive access barring functionality is enabled.

Skipping Access Class Barring for a Traffic Class

To allow UEs to skip the access class barring check for a specific traffic class, the

Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring feature must

be activated, and the attributes controlling the access class barring skip must be

configured.

If the UEs are expected to use the common access class barring parameters, the

following attributes must be set:

| Attribute                                                                          | Traffic Class                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.acBarringSkipForMmtelVideo  EUtranCellTDD.acBarringSkipForMmtelVideo | Mobile originating MMTEL video   |
| EUtranCellFDD.acBarringSkipForMmtelVoice  EUtranCellTDD.acBarringSkipForMmtelVoice | Mobile originating MMTEL voice   |
| EUtranCellFDD.acBarringSkipForSms  EUtranCellTDD.acBarringSkipForSms               | Mobile originating SMSoIP or SMS |

If the UEs are expected to use the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, the

following attributes must be set:

- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringSkipForMmtelVideo, for mobile originating MMTEL video
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringSkipForMmtelVoice, for mobile originating MMTEL voice
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringSkipForSms, for mobile originating SMSoIP or SMS

Monitoring the Current Barring Factors and Priority Levels

The current barring factors and priority levels can be monitored using the following

read-only attributes.

| Factor                       | Attribute                                                                            |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Barring factor               | EUtranCellFDD.loadBasedBarringFactor  EUtranCellTDD.loadBasedBarringFactor           |
| Traffic class priority level | EUtranCellFDD.lbabBarringPriorityLevel  EUtranCellTDD.lbabBarringPriorityLevel       |
| PLMN priority level          | EUtranCellFDD.plmnPabBarringPriorityLevel  EUtranCellTDD.plmnPabBarringPriorityLevel |

The barring factors for the traffic classes in the common access barring parameters

are based on the barring factors calculated for the lowest priority PLMN.

## 9.1 Common Access Barring Parameter Configuration for PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The common access class barring parameters must be configured, because these

parameters must be present in SIB2 messages for UEs that are unable to read the

corresponding PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

The values of attribute acBarringTime in

the struct of the following corresponding MO attributes are broadcast in the common or

the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters in SIB2 as configured:

| Common Access Class Barring Attributes                                         | PLMN-Specific Access Class Barring Attributes   | Traffic Class                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.acBarringForCsfb  EUtranCellTDD.acBarringForCsfb                 | PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForCsfb              | Mobile originating CSFB        |
| EUtranCellFDD.acBarringForMoData  EUtranCellTDD.acBarringForMoData             | PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMoData            | Mobile originating data        |
| EUtranCellFDD.acBarringForMoSignalling  EUtranCellTDD.acBarringForMoSignalling | PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMoSign            | Mobile originating signaling   |
| EUtranCellFDD.ssacBarringForMMTELVideo  EUtranCellTDD.ssacBarringForMMTELVideo | PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMmtelVideo        | Mobile originating MMTEL video |
| EUtranCellFDD.ssacBarringForMMTELVoice  EUtranCellTDD.ssacBarringForMMTELVoice | PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMmtelVoice        | Mobile originating MMTEL voice |

The value of attribute acBarringFactor

and acBarringForSpecialAC in the struct of the same MO attributes

is broadcast for each traffic class only if the presence field for the corresponding

traffic class is set to MANUAL.

If the barring factor of standard access classes or the barring state of special access

classes of the corresponding traffic class needs to be updated according to the traffic

load situations, the following attributes in theAcBarringPresence

structure corresponding to the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence attributes should be set to

AUTO:

- acBarringForCsfbPresence, for mobile originating CSFB
- acBarringForMoDataPresence, for mobile originating data
- acBarringForMoSignPresence, for mobile originating signaling
- acBarringForMmtelVideoPresence, for mobile originating MMTEL video
- acBarringForMmtelVoicePresence, for mobile originating MMTEL voice

Emergency Call Barring

Emergency call in the common access barring parameters in SIB2 messages can be

configured using attribute EUtranCellFDD.acBarringForEmergency or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringForEmergency. The access barring

parameter is broadcast, if attribute

acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres in the struct

AcBarringPresence corresponding to attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence is set to

MANUAL.

The barring of emergency call is updated according to the traffic load situation if

the presence attribute acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres is set

to AUTO.

## 9.2 Load-Based Access Barring Parameter Configuration for PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The load-based access class barring parameters must be configured properly for the

PLMN-Specific Access Barring functionalities.

The following load-based access class barring parameters must be configured:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbabDecr
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabDecr
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabIncr
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabIncr
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactor
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactor
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabPeriod
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabPeriod
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshRejectRateLow
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshRejectRateLow
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeLow
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeLow
- EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab
- EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab

The parameters are recommended to be configured as for the Load-Based Access Barring

feature.

Enabling Minimum Intensity Limit

The feature uses the

EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab and

EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab attributes to enable

adjustments to the minimum intensity limit of RRC

connection

requests in the cell. The intensity of RRC

connection

requests in the cell must be higher than the minimum intensity limit

for the feature to be operational.

The default value of the

EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab and

EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab attributes is

50,

which amounts to five RRC

connection

request messages every second.

Setting the value of the attributes lower than the default

value increases the probability of the Load-Based Access Barring feature being

operational in the cell. Similarly, setting the value higher than the default value

decreases the probability of the feature being operational in the cell. If the value of

the attributes is set too high, the access barring cannot be triggered, and the

Load-Based Access Barring feature can become disabled in the cell.

## 9.3 Progressive Access Barring Parameter Configuration for PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The progressive access class barring parameters can be configured if UEs are to be

barred progressively depending on traffic classes. Each traffic class can have its own

priority level.

The common and the PLMN-specific access

barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic

classes.

To apply the priority level of a traffic class the presence attribute for the traffic

class must be set to AUTO. The following presence attributes can be set in the

AcBarringPresence structure corresponding to

theEUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence attribute:

- acBarringPriorityCsfb, for mobile originating CSFB
- acBarringPriorityMoData, for mobile originating data
- acBarringPriorityMoSign, for mobile originating signaling
- acBarringPriorityMmtelVideo, for mobile originating MMTEL video
- acBarringPriorityMmtelVoice, for mobile originating MMTEL voice

It is possible to allow UEs a minimum possibility to access the network even in severe

system overload situations. This can be configured for each traffic priority level using

the following attributes:

|   Priority Level | MO Attribute                                                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                0 | EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactor  EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactor           |
|                1 | EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio1  EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio1 |
|                2 | EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio2  EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio2 |
|                3 | EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio3  EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio3 |
|                4 | EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio4  EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio4 |

The parameters are recommended to be configured as for the Progressive Access Barring

feature.

## 9.4 Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes Configuration for PLMN-Specific Access Barring

The progressive barring for special access classes parameters can be configured if

UEs with special access classes are to be barred differentiated based on PLMN.

To apply the priority level of a special access class in a traffic class the presence

attribute for the special access class must be set to AUTO. The

following priority attributes can be set in the AcBarringPresence

structure corresponding to the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence attribute:

- acBarringPrioCsfbSpecAc, for mobile originating CSFB
- acBarringPrioMoDataSpecAc, for mobile originating data
- acBarringPrioMoSignalingSpecAc, for mobile originating signaling
- acBarringPrioMmtelVideoSpecAc, for mobile originating MMTEL video
- acBarringPrioMmtelVoiceSpecAc, for mobile originating MMTEL voice
- acBarringPrioEmergencySpecAc, for emergency special access class

## 9.5 PLMN-Specific Access Barring Parameter Configuration for PLMN-Specific Access Barring

To operate the PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature, the PLMN-specific access

class         barring parameters must be configured. The parameters are configured in PLMN access barring

configuration profiles. Each cell can have references to three profiles to differentiate

between PLMNs.

On a node, six different PLMN access barring configuration profiles can be set. Each

profile has its own PLMN ID for the corresponding PLMN.

A cell can reference three different PLMN access barring profiles. The access

class             parameters defined by a referenced PLMN access barring profile are broadcast in SIB2

messages only if the PLMN ID of the profile is among the PLMNs served in the cell

(listed in EUtranCellFDD.activePlmnList or

EUtranCellTDD.activePlmnList).

For the Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality, each PLMN access

barring profile can have its own priority level. The PLMN priority levels can be of the

following, in order of increasing priority:

- Priority 0
- Priority 1
- Priority 2

Each PLMN access barring configuration profile defines a set of PLMN-specific access

barring parameters in MO PlmnAbConfProfile.

The values of attribute acBarringTime in the struct of the following

corresponding MO attributes are broadcast in the PLMN-specific access class barring

parameters in SIB2 as configured:

- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForCsfb, for mobile originating CSFB
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMoData, for mobile originating data
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMoSignalling, for mobile originating signaling
- PlmnAbConfProfile.ssacBarringForMmtelVideo, for mobile originating MMTEL video
- PlmnAbConfProfile.ssacBarringForMmtelVoice, for mobile originating MMTEL voice

The value of attribute acBarringFactor

and acBarringForSpecialAC in the struct of the same MO attributes

is broadcast for each traffic class only if the presence field for the corresponding

traffic class is set to MANUAL.

If the barring factor of the corresponding traffic class needs to be updated according to

the traffic load situations, the following access barring presence attributes should be

set to AUTO:

- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForCsfbPresence, for mobile originating CSFB
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMoDataPresence, for mobile originating data
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMoSignalPresence, for mobile originating signaling
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMmtelVidPres, for mobile originating MMTEL video
- PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForMmtelVoicePres, for mobile originating MMTEL voice

Emergency Call Barring

Emergency call barring in the PLMN-specific access barring parameters can be

configured using attribute PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringEmergency.

The value of the parameter is broadcast in SIB2 messages if attribute

PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres is set to

MANUAL.

The barring of emergency call is updated according to the traffic load situation if

the attribute PlmnAbConfProfile.acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres

is set to AUTO.
