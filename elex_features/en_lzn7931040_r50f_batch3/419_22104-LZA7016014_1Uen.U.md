# 1 Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users Overview

The Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users feature ensures the acceptance of

more Privileged Access (PA) users in favor of non-privileged Access users by triggering the

UE preemption mechanism if SR resources from the pools dedicated for PA users are used.

Summary

If the preemption mechanism is triggered, the existing inactive users or users with lower

priority are released. This ensures the availability of SR resources for any

additional incoming PA user.

The Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users feature depends on the

Differentiated Admission Control feature and is related to the Dynamic PUCCH

feature.

Otherwise, it is set with the                                     EUtranCellFDD.nrOfPucchUsers or                                     EUtranCellTDD.nrOfPucchUsers attributes.   Moreover, a verification ensures that the                                     EUtranCellFDD.allocThrPucchFormat1 or                                     EUtranCellTDD.allocThrPucchFormat1 attributes                                 in the Dynamic PUCCH feature are always set to a value higher than                                 the AdmissionControl.limitSrNonPa attribute.

Network Requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users

The Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users feature reserves SR resources for

Privileged Access (PA) users to ensure that there are free SR resources in high load

situations.

If the PA user needs SR resources, but there are no free SR resources from the regular

pool, the UE preemption mechanism is triggered to release existing inactive user or user

with lower priority.

During preemption, the PA users use SR resource from the SR resources pool reserved for

PA users.

For more information about the preemption mechanism, see Differentiated Admission Control.

Pool reserved for PA users can consist of one or both of the dedicated pools which

reserve resources on cell level:

- Preallocated pool
- Limitation pool

For more information on the preallocated and limitation pool, see Admission Control.

SR Resource Allocation for PA Users

SR resources are allocated in the following ways:

- Normally SR resources are allocated to both non-PA and PA users until the regular pool is exhausted.
- If there are no free SR resources from the regular pool: The PA users are allocated SR resources reserved for PA users by limitation on cell level (if limitation pool is activated). Each allocation of the SR resource from the limitation pool triggers the preemption procedure of existing inactive user or user with lower priority. Non-PA users are rejected.
- If there are no free SR resources from the regular and limitation pool or there are no free SR resources in the regular pool and the limitation pool is deactivated, the following apply: PA users are able to use preallocated SR resources if the preallocated pool is activated. Each assignment of preallocated SR resource from the preallocated pool triggers a preemption procedure of existing inactive user or user with lower priority. Non-PA users are rejected.
- If there are no free SR resources on baseband level (even if limit on cell level is not reached), the following apply: The PA users can use the SR resources preallocated for PA users if the preallocated pool is activated. Each assignment of the preallocated SR resource from the preallocated pool triggers a preemption procedure of existing inactive user or user with lower priority. Non-PA users are rejected.
- If there are no free SR resources from the activated pools (regular, limitation, and preallocated pool), all users are rejected.
