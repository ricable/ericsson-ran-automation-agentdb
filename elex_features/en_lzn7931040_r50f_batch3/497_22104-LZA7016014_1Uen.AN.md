Summary

This feature extends the carrier aggregation function of downlink transmission on

several carriers. With this feature, selected downlink traffic can be transmitted to

the UEs using only dedicated secondary cells (offloading SCells) as long as the

capacity of these carriers is below the configured steering threshold.

Without the feature, the carrier aggregation algorithm splits downlink data among all

active carriers. Therefore, the PCell is always considered for downlink transmission

to the UE. This feature reduces the use of the PCell, and increases the use of the

offloading SCells.

This feature supports downlink traffic steering from the PCell to SCells of any type.

Feature configuration is performed at node level and is applied for any PCell with

existing cell relations to offloading SCells that are configured for traffic

steering. Downlink traffic to be steered is configurable on QCI level.

The feature has the following benefits:

- The use of offloading SCells is increased to offload the PCell and other regular SCells.
- The use of downlink resources is reduced on the PCell. The released resources can be reused for other services.
- The peak throughput of the UE is not affected. If the capacity of the offloading SCells is not enough, other carriers are used in downlink transmission.

If a UE sends a             scheduling request on PUCCH to a PCell, the eNodeB sends an uplink grant to the             offloading SCell even if the offloading SCell downlink SINR is low.

If the UE fails to receive the uplink grant, it sends the             scheduling request again. Once the maximum number of scheduling request transmissions,             configured in the dsrTransMax attribute, is reached, the UE initiates             a random access procedure. This might increase the PmPucchFailSr PM             counter. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- The feature does not support downlink traffic steering to Inter-eNodeB SCells. External SCells are not considered as offloading SCells.
- When the feature is active, the QciProfilePredefined.laaSupported attribute, or the QciProfileOperatorDefined.laaSupported attribute is not effective for LAA SCells. Instead, the QciProfilePredefined.caOffloadingEnabled attribute, or the QciProfileOperatorDefined.caOffloadingEnabled attribute is effective.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.1 or later is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering

The feature extends the carrier aggregation function by offering an alternative way of

adjusting total transmission capacity in downlink for carrier aggregation UEs. The capacity

of the carrier is based on its bandwidth and current radio

condition.

| Offloading SCells can be used for downlink transmission at any                                 time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | SCells can be used for downlink transmission only when the UE data                                 demand cannot be met by the PCell.                                                                                             |

The feature improves the use of the selected SCells and allows the following

configurations:

- Configuration of which carrier types or bands act as offloading.
- Configuration of what kind of downlink traffic (which QCI) is allowed to be steered through offloading SCells.
- Configuration of traffic steering threshold, which is the level of UE RLC data buffered in the eNodeB. Below this threshold, only offloading SCells are considered in downlink transmission.

In every TTI, the feature controls which carriers are considered in downlink

transmission.

- If the UE RLC buffered data from offloading-enabled QCIs is below the capacity threshold of all activated offloading SCells, only offloading SCells are considered in downlink transmission.
- If the UE RLC buffered data from offloading-enabled QCIs is above the capacity threshold of the offloading SCells, the PCell and all activated SCells-including offloading and non-offloading SCells-are considered in downlink transmission.

## 3.1 3CC Configuration with Two SCells Configured as Offloading SCells

The feature controls downlink traffic steering through dedicated offloading SCells.

Traffic steering behavior depends on the volume of the buffered UE data.

Traffic

1. The size of buffered data from offloading-enabled QCIs is below the maximum capacity of offloading SCells.
2. The size of buffered data from offloading-enabled QCIs is below the RLC split limit. Therefore, data is only transmitted through the offloading SCell which has the best capacity. Data is not fragmented. Note: The RLC split limit is fixed and equals 400 bytes.
3. PCell is offloaded.

## 3.2 Offloading Mode Configuration

With the feature, it is possible to configure SCells as offloading

SCells.

The CarrierAggregationFunction.caOffloadingMode attribute controls

which SCells serve the steering function:

- ENABLED\_LAA\_SCELLS: LAA SCells can act as offloading SCells.
- ENABLED\_SDL\_SCELLS: supplemental downlink SCells (FDD cells with the EUtranCellFDD.isDlOnly attribute set to true) can act as offloading SCells.
- ENABLED\_SDL\_AND\_LAA\_SCELLS: supplemental downlink SCells (FDD cells with the EUtranCellFDD.isDlOnly attribute set to true) and LAA SCells can act as offloading SCells.
- ENABLED\_SELECTED\_SCELLS: any of the following cell types can act as offloading SCells: FDD TDD LAA Supplemental downlink

Offloading Configuration with the ENABLED\_SELECTED\_SCELLS

Mode

When the CarrierAggregationFunction.caOffloadingMode attribute is

set to ENABLED\_SELECTED\_SCELLS, traffic steering can be configured

on the following levels:

- On the frequency level, setting the EUtranFrequency.caOffloadingEnabled attribute to true enables offloading on every SCell on the configured frequency.
- On the frequency relation level, PCells can be configured as offloaded to the offloading frequencies. By default, offloading is enabled on all frequency relations. Setting the EUtranFreqRelation.caOffloadingEnabled or EUtranFreqRelationUnlicensed.caOffloadingEnabled attribute to false restricts the PCell from offloading to the configured frequency.

## 3.3 Downlink Traffic Steering Configuration

It is possible to configure the type of downlink traffic to be steered with the

feature.

The QciProfilePredefined.caOffloadingEnabled or the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.caOffloadingEnabled attribute controls

what kind of downlink traffic is to be steered through offloading SCells.

- If the QciProfilePredefined.caOffloadingEnabled or QciProfileOperatorDefined.caOffloadingEnabled attribute is set to true, the downlink data of QCIs is sent through only activated offloading SCells. This requires the capacity of the offloading SCells (scaled with the CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh attribute) to be enough to send this data in time. Otherwise, the data can also be sent through other carriers (PCell and activated non-offloading SCells).
- If the QciProfilePredefined.caOffloadingEnabled or the QciProfileOperatorDefined.caOffloadingEnabled attribute is set to false, the downlink data of QCIs is sent through only the PCell and activated non-offloading SCells.

## 3.4 Offloading Threshold Configuration

The CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh attribute

controls the offloading level.

The CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh attribute defines

the minimum time needed to transmit all buffered downlink bits in offloading-enabled

QCIs through offloading SCells.

The minimum time is the sum of downlink bits buffered in all offloading-enabled QCIs,

divided by the number of bits that can be transmitted in one TTI through all active

offloading SCells. For this calculation, the UE is assumed to be assigned with all

downlink resources in all active offloading SCells.

If the calculated minimum time is below the

CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh attribute, only

offloading SCells are considered in downlink transmission. Otherwise, the PCell and all

active SCells are considered.

## 3.5 Offloading SCells Activation and Deactivation

If this feature is activated, offloading SCells, once configured for downlink traffic

steering, are activated and ready for downlink transmission.

The following configurations control the activation and deactivation of offloading

SCells:

- The configured offloading SCells cannot be deactivated based on data-triggered deactivation. That means that the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellActDeactDataThres or the UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaSCellActDeactDataThres attribute does not affect offloading SCells (but it still affects non-offloading SCells).
- The configured offloading SCells can be deactivated based on poor coverage-triggered deactivation. The CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres attribute can be set to deactivate the offloading SCells or keep them activated, even if coverage is poor.
- The activation and deactivation of the configured offloading SCells can be differentiated for UEs in subscriber groups by using the SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute when the ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package feature is active. If the SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute is configured, the threshold for the UEs in a subscriber group is the sum of the following attributes: CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset For the UEs that are not in the subscriber group, the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres attribute determines the SCell activation and deactivation threshold.

# 4 Network Impact of Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering

The feature can increase the carrier load on the offloading

frequency.

Capacity and Performance

Steering towards SCells of low transmission quality is not recommended, it can affect

the transmission related KPIs of the UEs.

Using the feature in networks with FDD SCells or TDD SCells can increase the carrier

load on the offloading frequency. If the offloaded traffic exceeds capacity on the

SCell, the throughput of standard traffic can decrease. To avoid high load, it is

recommended to configure bands with the least amount of traffic as offloaded.

Alternatively, the offloading level can be controlled with the

CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh

attribute.

Peak DL UE throughput is affected by the

CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh attribute

value. High attribute values result in buffer steering splits, which decrease peak

DL UE throughput.

When traffic steering is configured for downlink-only SCells, the throughput of

standard traffic is unaffected. Therefore, the level of offloading can be configured

to the highest value to maximize the benefits of traffic steering and the offloading

of the PCell. The throughput of LAA cells can be increased if the feature is used in

networks with a significant number of LAA-capable UEs that have a good coverage of

offloading SCells. The throughput is increased only if the LAA-capable UEs have

traffic associated with offloading-enabled QCIs. Most of the data in

offloading-enabled QCIs are transmitted through offloading SCells and the PCell is

significantly offloaded. In this case, distribution of modulation schemes on the

PCell can be different. Share of higher modulation schemes (64-QAM and 256-QAM) can

decrease, while share of lower modulation schemes (QPSK and 16-QAM) can

increase.

When traffic is steered towards carriers of lower transmission

quality than PCell (for example higher PDCCH error rate or higher PDSCH BLER) RLC

success ratio can be negatively affected.

Negative KPI impact on UE DRX Sleep Ratio can occur. The decrease of the UE DRX Sleep

Ratio is because of more occurrences of DRX inactivity timer restarts when the

Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering maintains activation of offloading

SCells.

The Average Number of Simultaneous Active UEs in DL per Cell KPI

cannot be used to evaluate traffic conditions if Carrier Aggregation is in use,

because of the PM counter limitations.

E-RAN limitations, such as the number of supported SEs per TTI per SCell can reduce

the performance of traffic steering to many remote SCells, compared to the

performance of similar configurations with only local SCells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering

## 9.1 Handling of VoLTE Packets in Carrier Aggregation

For the optimal feature operation, it is recommended not to configure VoLTE QCIs as

offloading-enabled.

In the case of PDCCH transmission, the SINR for carrier aggregation UEs is updated when

only the PCell is used. When the Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering feature

is active, the rare updating of the SINR can result in the decrease of VoLTE KPIs. To

refine the SINR and the KPIs, VoLTE services can be disabled on the SCells by setting

the CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte attribute to

false. As a result, both VoLTE and non-VoLTE traffic can contribute

to the PDCCH SINR of the PCell. However, the maximum throughput of non-VoLTE traffic can

also increase while using VoLTE services.

To ensure that VoLTE services are never offloaded from the PCell, the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.caOffloadingEnabled attribute of a QCI

must be set to false when the service type of the QCI is set to

VOIP.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q4: Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering to Remote Downlink-Only SCells

This enhancement supports remote downlink-only SCells for UEs configured with carrier

aggregation.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5237                                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0564                                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                             |

Benefits

The enhancement increases the use of remote LAA and supplemental downlink SCells (FDD

cells with the EUtranCellFDD.isDlOnly attribute set to

true) and offloads of other carriers. Therefore, the use of

downlink resources on the primary carrier can be reduced or reused for other

services. The enhancement also increases the use of E-RAN and makes carrier

aggregation deployment more flexible.

Capacity and Performance

The performance of traffic steering to remote SCells is similar to the performance of

traffic steering to local SCells, as long as the amount of steered traffic does not

exceed the E-RAN limitations. In dense E-RAN configurations, the performance of

traffic steering to many remote SCells can be lower than the performance of similar

configurations with only local SCells.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.3 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q2: Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering to FDD SCells and TDD SCells

This enhancement supports downlink traffic steering to FDD SCells and TDD SCells for

UEs configured with carrier

aggregation.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation Downlink Traffic Steering   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5237                                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0564                                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                             |

Benefits

The enhancement supports carrier aggregation downlink traffic steering to FDD SCells

and TDD SCells. This way, downlink resource use can be reduced and the resources can

be used by other services. The enhancement can also make NR NSA deployments more

flexible by offloading bands that are shared between NR and LTE, and steering

traffic to non-shared LTE bands.

Capacity and Performance

In networks with FDD or TDD SCells, the enhancement can increase the load of carriers

on the offloading frequency. If the offloaded traffic overflows on the SCell, the

throughput of standard traffic can decrease. To avoid high load, it is recommended

to configure bands with the least amount of traffic as offloaded. Alternatively, the

offloading level can be controlled with the

CarrierAggregationFunction.offloadingDataThresh

attribute.

Operation

The CarrierAggregationFunction.caOffloadingMode attribute is

updated with the ENABLED\_SELECTED\_SCELLS value, which enables the

operator to select the offloading SCells manually.

The enhancement introduces the following attributes to configure offloading

SCells:

- EUtranFrequency.caOffloadingEnabled
- EUtranFreqRelation.caOffloadingEnabled
- EUtranFreqRelationUnlicensed.caOffloadingEnabled

The enhancement introduces the following PM counters to observe the benefits of

downlink traffic steering:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellOffl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellOffl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEranOffl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEranOffl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCaSchedDlOffloadingDistr

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware
