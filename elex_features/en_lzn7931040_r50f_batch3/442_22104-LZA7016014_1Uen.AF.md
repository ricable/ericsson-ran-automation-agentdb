# 1 Enhanced PTT Admission Control Overview

The

Enhanced

PTT Admission

Control

feature reserves an estimate of the dynamic resources in downlink

required for PTT bearers during a PTT call.

Securing the QoS of GBR traffic relies on bearer admission control that monitors the

dynamic resources of the system. Because of the intermittent nature of PTT traffic,

existing admission control mechanisms cannot protect the system from overload or the

degradation of GBR QoS.

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature estimates the required dynamic resources for

PTT bearers in downlink. The estimate is continuously updated. The estimate takes PTT

use into account and it is kept throughout the lifetime of the bearer. The estimate is

kept even during traffic gaps when no dynamic resources are used. The PTT reservations

are updated immediately upon PTT bearer admission or release.

The feature enables the incoming Privileged Access (PA) GBR bearers to trigger pre-emption or

rejection if dynamic GBR resources in downlink are in overload.

Using the Enhanced PTT Admission Control and the Dynamic GBR Admission Control features

together

has the following benefits:

- This feature protects downlink GBR QoS if PTT traffic is in the system.
- This feature protects GBR QoS if PA GBR bearer setup requests arrive during overload of dynamic GBR resources in downlink.
- This feature enables bearer pre-emption by the incoming PA GBR bearers during overload of dynamic GBR resources in downlink.

Using the Enhanced PTT Admission Control and the Dynamic UE Admission Control features

together has the following benefits:

- The performance of the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature is improved in high load scenarios when PTT UEs are present in the cell, because of consideration of downlink PTT MSR reservations.
- The activation of the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature decreases the risk of increasing the dynamic load by privileged access UEs when the system is already in overload.

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature improves the function of the following

admission control features:

- Admission-Triggered Offload
- Differentiated Admission Control
- Dynamic GBR Admission Control
- Dynamic UE Admission Control

# 2 Dependencies of Enhanced PTT Admission Control

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is not supported on TDD.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, the following network requirements must be

fulfilled:

- The Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk application server must be used in the core network.
- The UE must be Release 12 or later and support Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk.

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced PTT Admission Control

The feature estimates the resources needed to maintain the QoS of PTT bearers both on

the cell and node levels. The resources are reserved for the PTT bearers to avoid a decrease

in the GBR QoS in downlink.

PTT Dynamic Resource Estimation and Reservation

A PTT call is set up when a single PTT user from a PTT group pushes the "talk" button

on their application. This action triggers a burst of QCI 65 and QCI 66 GBR media

bearer establishment requests. The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature reserves

the dynamic resources for PTT when the PTT bearers are admitted to avoid a delay in

dynamic load information. The resources are reserved for all PTT bearers, even if

they are not active. This protects the system from overload if a large number of PTT

bearer setup requests arrive in a short time interval. The reservation is based on

the following factors:

- The number of admitted PTT bearers in the cell and eNodeB that is updated upon bearer setup and release.
- The estimation of use for a single PTT bearer. It is recalculated in every observation period based on the current resource use from active PTT bearers in the cell and eNodeB.

The PTT resource reservation is done for the following MSRs:

- Downlink GBR PRB use for each cell
- Downlink GBR PRB use for each RBS
- Downlink GBR SE use for each cell
- Downlink GBR SE use for each RBS
- GBR CCE use for each cell (downlink and uplink shared, PTT reservations only in the downlink component)
- Downlink GBR Baseband Capacity use for each RBS

When the voice traffic bearers are set up, the average dynamic load needed for a

single PTT bearer in downlink is estimated. This estimation is re-calculated in

every MSR measurement period. Then, the total load needed for all established PTT

media bearers are reserved. The estimation is triggered only when there is

sufficient number of active PTT bearers. When the number of active PTT bearers

drops, the last estimated value is used.

Example 1   PTT Dynamic Resource Estimation and Reservation

Effects of Enhanced PTT Admission Control on Feature Operation Processes

When the following features are activated together with the Enhanced PTT Admission

Control feature, the operational processes of these features are modified:

- The Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature considers the downlink PTT dynamic MSR reservation during the bearer admission process.
- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature considers the downlink PTT dynamic MSR reservation during the UE admission process.
- The Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature introduces a third threshold within the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature. UE requests, including privileged access requests are immediately rejected or queued instead above the introduced threshold. After a period, the queued requests can be admitted or rejected depending on the availability of system resources. This feature keeps the system stability on high level in overload scenarios when high number of privileged access users in the cell are expected. These users can be, for example, PTT users.

## 3.1 Dynamic GBR Admission Control Threshold Check

If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the Dynamic GBR Admission

Control operational process is modified. The thresholds are first compared to the legacy

MSR measurements in uplink and downlink. If the bearer is not rejected, the thresholds

are compared to the downlink MSRs that consider PTT reservations. This operational

process enables tracking of the number of additional GBR bearer setup rejections caused

by the PTT reservations.

Figure 1   Dynamic GBR Admission Control Threshold Check

## 3.2 Privileged Access GBR Bearer Admission and Pre-Emption

If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is enabled together with the Differentiated

Admission Control feature, the treatment of PA GBR bearer requests is modified. When

comparing the downlink MSRs to the overload threshold, the PA GBR bearer request is no

longer unconditionally admitted.

Figure 2   Privileged Access GBR Bearer Admission and Rejection

If any of the six impacted downlink MSRs is above the overload threshold and pre-emption

is enabled, the incoming PA GBR bearer requests trigger the pre-emption algorithm. If

pre-emption is successful, the bearer is admitted. If pre-emption is not enabled or not

successful, the PA GBR bearer request is rejected. This protects the GBR services from

QoS degradation in mission-critical scenarios when a large number of PA GBR bearer

requests can occur.

If the Differentiated Admission Control feature is not activated, the treatment of PA GBR

bearer requests is not modified. They are not rejected by the Dynamic GBR Admission

Control feature and they are not able to trigger pre-emption.

## 3.3 Dynamic UE Admission Control Threshold Check

When the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, the Dynamic UE Admission

Control operational process is modified. The thresholds are first compared to the legacy

MSR measurements in uplink and downlink. If the UE is not rejected, the thresholds are

compared to the downlink MSRs that consider PTT reservations. This operational process

enables tracking the number of additional UE rejections caused by PTT reservations.

If activated, the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature

adds a third threshold within the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature. Without

activating the Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature, UE requests are rejected

above the introduced threshold, including privileged access requests. If the Prioritized

Call Queuing at High Load feature is activated, all UE requests, including privileged

access requests are queued for a period above the introduced threshold, instead of being

rejected immediately. When a UE is attempting to connect to the node, the filtered MSRs

are compared to the three thresholds. The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature

calculates these filtered MSRs. When any of the filtered MSRs is above a corresponding

threshold, specific UE access requests are rejected.

Figure 3   Admission Policy

# 4 Network Impact of Enhanced PTT Admission Control

The feature reserves cell resources for PTT traffic to ensure the GBR QoS.

Capacity and Performance

The GBR QoS is improved if pulsed PTT traffic is present in the system. This reduces

GBR capacity.

Activated together with the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature, the Enhanced PTT

Admission Control feature enables incoming Privileged Access (PA) GBR bearers to

trigger preemption or rejection during overload of dynamic resources in

downlink.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

This feature requires ENM version 19.2 or later to be used.

Benefits

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature continuously estimates the maximum amount

of dynamic resources needed in downlink for PTT traffic. PTT reservations are

immediately updated when admitting or releasing PTT bearers. By activating the

enhancement, the algorithm of the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature becomes

available for the affected features and function. They become capable for

considering the dynamic PTT downlink MSR reservation at MSR use calculation. The

enhancement ensures the following benefits for the following affected features and

function:

- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature allows only those UEs to be admitted that can be adequately served.
- The Preferential Traffic Management function improves blocking handovers for non-priority UEs and blocking idle mode camping when PTT UEs are present in the eNodeB. This feature is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.
- The Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature improves prioritizing cell resources for RRC connected users if there is high load.
- An attribute is introduced for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature to control the rejection of the privileged access bearer setup requests. Also, improved handover and re-establishment rejection observability is ensured for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control and the Enhanced PTT Admission Control features. Dynamic GBR Admission Control is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.
