# 1 Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity Overview

The feature provides basic connected mode mobility between frequencies in the LTE

network while maintaining the data session.

|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 0797                                                             |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400                                                             |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                      |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                      |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each radio node. |

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature manages the redirection of

connected mode UEs RRC\_CONNECTED to a different LTE frequency when the UE

measures poor coverage in the current LTE frequency. Redirection is controlled by the network

and triggered by UE measurement reports of the serving LTE cell.

The feature provides system information about alternative LTE frequencies that can be used by

a UE in RRC\_IDLE mode for cell reselection.

If no session continuity feature is activated, the UE is configured not to trigger

measurements of poor coverage. Instead, the UE remains connected to the original frequency

within the LTE network with poor LTE coverage. If the UE is eventually released, it is

required to perform idle mode cell reselection to move to another LTE frequency. This

interruption time is long if the UE is connected to the LTE frequency with poor coverage for a

long period while an alternative LTE frequency can provide better quality.

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature has the following

benefits:

- Network capacity is enhanced by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available frequency within the network.
- Off-loading is possible by configuring coverage thresholds.
- Service performance for an individual UE is enhanced by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available frequency within the network.
- Session transition to another LTE frequency is possible with reduced interruptions to data flows during the transition process.

Parameters for Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity

The feature uses measurements to release and redirect the UE to an alternative LTE

frequency if the UE reports poor coverage.

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature uses the A2 measurement

process. The A2 measurement is when the serving cell coverage becomes worse than the

threshold, as defined in the following standard specifications:

- 3GPP TS 36.300
- 3GPP TS 36.331

The UE uses the measurement parameters sent by the serving eNodeB for the measurement

process to evaluate the serving cell. These parameters sent to the UE in the

RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages include the following

information:

- Hysteresis values
- Measurement filtering
- Threshold values
- Time-to-trigger parameters

The time-to-trigger parameters are included in the evaluation to prevent redirection to

an alternative LTE frequency based on a small number of measurements taken during a

rapid fade in the radio link. Hysteresis is used for protection against re-triggering

A2 measurement and triggering unnecessary UE measurement report transmissions.

The UE measurements are reported to the serving eNodeB to make the final decision on

redirection to an alternative LTE frequency.

The A2 measurement can base its triggering criterion on either of the following measurements:

| RSRP   |    | Indicates the mean measured power for each reference signal.                                                 |
|--------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        |    |                                                                                                              |
| RSRQ   |    | Indicates the reference signal quality, especially high inter-cell                             interference. |

The eNodeB configures the UE with two A2 measurements to detect poor coverage. One

of them is based on RSRP and one of them is based on RSRQ using the default settings.

The eNodeB considers a UE to be in poor coverage when at least one of the measurements

report poor coverage

The eNodeB determines whether to release the UE with a redirection to an alternative LTE

frequency based on the following criteria:

- Node licenses
- Redirection priority
- UE capabilities

If the UE is released with a redirection to an alternative LTE frequency, the release

message contains the E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) to help the

UE find a suitable LTE cell.

For more information about idle mode cell reselection, see Idle Mode Support.

## 3.1 Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

The following Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity features operate the same way:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity
- TDD only: Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity

To understand how these interact when several or all of theses features are operational,

the description here covers all of them.

Figure 1   How and Where to Transfer the UE at Poor Coverage

Operational process:

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB determines a set of frequencies for LTE or IRAT, where the UE is transferred when it encounters poor coverage in the current cell.
    1. The eNodeB searches all frequency relations in the following MO instances for the corresponding RAT: Frequency Relation MO Corresponding RAT EUtranFreqRelation LTE GeranFreqGroupRelation GERAN UtranFreqRelation WCDMA Cdma2000FreqBandRelation CDMA-eHRPD UtranTDDFreqRelation TD-SCDMA The following criteria has to be fulfilled for the eNodeB to find a frequency relation:
        - The corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is active and enabled. The corresponding frequency relation MO instance is included only, if the corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is activated and enabled.
        - The frequency of the serving cell is not represented, so the EUtranFreqRelation for the frequency of the serving cell is not included.
        - The UE is capable to operate on the frequency.
        - If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
        - If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
    2. Construct the following two sets from the set found at step 2.a: A set where all frequency relations with the attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio set to -1 are excluded. A set where all frequency relations with the attribute voicePrio set to -1 are excluded.
3. If coverage provided by the serving cell drops below the parameter-defined threshold for poor coverage, the UE is configured to send an A2 measurement report, if at least one of the sets of frequencies found is not empty.
4. If the UE encounters poor coverage, the A2 measurement is triggered in the UE and it sends a measurement report to the eNodeB. The eNodeB selects the candidate frequency relations with the highest priority from the set of frequencies found at step 2.a. The priorities are determined using priority attributes on the frequency relation MOs: If the UE has an active voice bearer (with QCI 1) The attribute voicePrio is used. Frequency relation MOs which does not have this attribute are ignored. If the UE has no active voice bearer (with QCI 1) The attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio is used. If the selected priority attribute has a -1 value All frequency relations are omitted. Several frequency relation MOs share the highest value for these attributes They are all selected. The set is empty because no frequency relation is selected The eNodeB continues to wait for another A2 measurement report from the UE.
5. The eNodeB first checks if a blind handover to a predefined cell is possible. This is enabled by the following handover features: Note: Only cells using a candidate frequency found at step 4 are considered for blind handover.
    - SRVCC Handover to GERAN
    - SRVCC Handover to UTRAN
    - Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover
    - Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
6. Measurements are started if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute is true and the candidate frequencies selected at step 4 contain at least one frequency which can be measured. A frequency can be measured, if the following criteria are fulfilled:
    - The UE supports measurements on the frequency.
    - The eNodeB supports measurements on the frequency. Note: The eNodeB supports measurements on all LTE and GERAN frequencies. The eNodeB supports measurements on WCDMA, CDMA-eHRPD, and TD-SCDMA (TDD only) frequencies only, if there are configured cells for these frequencies with the MO instances of UtranCellRelation and Cdma2000CellRelation.
7. If measurements are not started, and the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 or the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is true, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to one of the selected frequencies. These are all on the same priority level, so the eNodeB can pick any one of them. It is unspecified which one the eNodeB picks, but given the same selection of frequencies, the eNodeB always picks the same frequency. If measurements are not started, but the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, and the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is false, the eNodeB waits for another A2 measurement report.
8. If measurements are started, the eNodeB starts A5 measurement or A3 measurements for LTE frequencies and B2 measurements for IRAT frequencies to detect the candidate frequencies selected at step 4 that can be measured as described in step 6. The eNodeB also starts A1 measurements to detect if the UE moves into good coverage again. At the same time the eNodeB starts the timer UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer.
9. If an A1 measurement report arrives from the UE, the eNodeB stops the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement and A1 measurements in the UE, and waits for another A2 measurement report.
10. If the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer times out and the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 (indicating a voice bearer), or the value of the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is true, the eNodeB releases the UE with a redirection to one of the frequencies for which A5 measurement, A3 measurement, or B2 measurements starts at step 8. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, the eNodeB restarts the timer and waits for another measurement report for the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement, or A1 measurement.
11. An A5 measurement report, A3 measurement report, or B2 measurement report arrives from the UE for one of the frequencies
12. The eNodeB first checks if a handover is possible to one of the reported cells. This is enabled by separate handover features.
13. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 (indicating a voice bearer), or the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is true, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to the frequency of the measurement report. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, and the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is false, the eNodeB waits for another measurement report for the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement, or A1 measurement.

## 3.2 Measurement Configuration

### 3.2.1 A1 Measurement

The feature uses A1 measurements to detect that the UE moved out of poor coverage

and does not need to be transferred to an alternative frequency.

The eNodeB configures two A1 measurements in the UE. These A1 measurements

correspond to the two A2 measurements for poor coverage. The A1 measurements can

be configured with the attributes in the ReportConfigA1Prim and

ReportConfigA1Sec MO classes.

### 3.2.2 A2 Measurement

The feature uses A2 measurements to detect that the UE is in poor

coverage.

The poor coverage evaluation can use primary and secondary measurement parameters to allow

the UE to use different settings for two simultaneous A2 measurements. Primary

measurements use RSRP and secondary measurements use RSRQ by default. However, both primary

and secondary measurements can use the same measurement quantity.

With two measurement thresholds for poor coverage evaluation, different hysteresis and timer

values can be used for the different threshold values.

The process for evaluation using the secondary parameters and threshold is similar, but

different parameter values can be used. For example, the

ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Prim attribute can be set to

trigger on RSRP measurements with a

ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim attribute set to 1 dB and

the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Sec attribute can be set

to trigger on RSRQ measurements with a

ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Sec attribute set to of 2 dB.

Figure 2   Poor Coverage Evaluation Process Using Primary Threshold

The UE uses the following formula to determine when A2 measurement starts:

The UE uses the following formula to determine when A2 measurement ends:

| Ms                 |    | The measured value of the serving cell (RSRP or RSRQ).                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| hysteresisA2prim   |    | The hysteresis value for A2 measurement, configured in the                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim attribute.                                                                       |
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| a2ThresholdPrimary |    | The threshold value for A2 measurement, configured in the                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim or                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim attributes. |

Measurements begin on the neighboring cells when the RSRP of the serving cell falls below the

value defined in the UeMeasControl.sMeasure attribute. The attribute is

also the trigger value for measurements used in intra-LTE handover.

Evaluation of A2 Measurement

The evaluation of the primary and the secondary trigger is identical and they are evaluated

parallel to each other.

1. The ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Prim attribute determines whether RSRP or RSRQ values trigger A2 measurement for the primary criterion. If the primary trigger quantity is set to RSRP, the threshold value set in the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim attribute is sent to the UE. Otherwise the RSRQ threshold value set in the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim attribute is sent.
2. The measured values of RSRP and RSRQ are filtered based on the settings of the UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrp and UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrq attributes. The filter averages several measurements to remove the impact of fast fading. The filter values are also used by the UE in the intra-LTE handover measurement process.
3. The UE applies the hysteresis value set in the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim attribute to determine whether to trigger the A2 measurement.
4. When A2 measurement is triggered, the UE waits for a predetermined time set in the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.timeToTriggerA2Prim attribute before it begins sending measurement reports to the serving eNodeB. The reports contain measurements for the serving cell.
5. Measurement reports are sent to the eNodeB periodically while the A2 measurement condition is fulfilled. The time interval between measurement reports is 480 ms.

### 3.2.3 A3 Measurement and A5 Measurement

The feature uses A3 measurement and A5 measurements to detect frequency

candidates.

The following measurement criteria can be used to find alternative LTE frequencies:

- A3 measurement
- A5 measurement

These criteria can be selected for each frequency relation with the

EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqMeasType attribute.

All LTE frequencies selected by the frequency selection algorithm use the same configuration

for the A5 measurements and A3 measurements. The A5 measurements can be configured with the

attributes in the ReportConfigA5 MO class. The A3 measurements can be

configured with the attributes in the ReportConfigEUtraIFBestCell MO

class.

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity

The feature improves network capacity and UE performance.

Capacity and Performance

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature enhances network capacity

by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available frequency within

the network.

It is possible to configure this feature in such a way that an off-loading effect is

achieved, where UEs are transferred from the LTE frequency to an alternative frequency. This

can be used to avoid overload and improve the overall network capacity.

The feature has no impact on the physical cell coverage, but offloading UEs to alternative

frequencies indirectly means that the coverage is improved. Activating the feature and

setting the threshold for poor coverage puts limits on the range of UE in the LTE

network.

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature decreases the time needed

for the UE to make connected mode transitions to an alternative LTE frequency.

If the feature is not activated, the UE loses LTE coverage completely before attempting to

an alternative LTE frequency.

triggering.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature needs to be

configured for optimal operation.

Configure Redirection of the UEs at Poor Coverage

To configure redirection of the UE in poor coverage, information about other

inter-frequency carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during network

configuration. The carrier frequency information is sent to the UE during the

redirection process to assist the UE in finding an alternative LTE frequency. An

EUtranFreqRelation MO and a corresponding

EUtranFrequency MO must be created for each LTE frequency

where it is possible to redirect the UE. For each such relation, the

EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio and

EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attributes are assigned a value

corresponding to its priority relative to other frequency relations. This is used

when determining where to redirect the UE in poor coverage.

Configure A1 Measurement and A2 Measurement

The settings for A1 measurement and A2 measurement must be adjusted so that they are reported

from the UE when appropriate.

Measurement in the UE

When a UE reports poor coverage, the eNodeB can transfer the UE to one of the

candidate frequencies. Or it can configure a new measurement in the UE to detect

possible frequencies before the UE is transferred. This is controlled by the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute. When this

attribute is set to true, a measurement is configured in the UE to

help detect frequencies where the UE can be transferred. If this attribute is set to

false, the UE is transferred to the new frequency without a new

measurement.

Configure SIB5 Broadcast

SIB5 contains system information about alternative LTE frequencies that can be used

by a UE in idle mode.

The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature must be enabled to

broadcast SIB5.

To configure a cell to broadcast SIB5, EUtranFreqRelation MO

instances must be added as children to EUtranCellFDD or

EUtranCellTDD MO. Only EUtranFreqRelation

MOs corresponding to other frequencies than that of the parent cell can be included

in SIB5.

For E-UTRAN, the maximum number of frequencies is eight if the UE supports 3GPP

Release 12 or less. If the UE supports 3GPP Release 12 or above, the maximum number

of frequencies is 15.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: Support for 16 E-UTRAN Frequency Relations and RRC Connected Mode

This improvement increases the E-UTRAN frequency relations from 8 to 16 in CONNECTED

mode.

| Feature Name:           | System Improvements in LTE RAN L19.Q4   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | 24/FAJ 121 1447                         |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node      |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

This improvement enhances UE handling in CONNECTED mode in networks with multiple E-UTRAN

frequency relations. With the improvement, the number and flexibility of active

measurements are increased for UEs that are capable of extended number of measurements

in CONNECTED mode, defined by the Release 12 of 3GPP TS 36.133 standard.

Flexibility and the number of E-UTRAN inter-frequencies are increased for UEs capable of

increased carrier monitoring.

The improvement also allows to send up to 64 measurement requests in one

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message for UEs that are capable of

Release 12 enhanced measurement.

Capacity and Performance

For additional eight measurement objects, eight report configurations, and eight

measurement IDs, message size is expected to increase by less than 100 bytes in the

following messages:

- Uu RRCConnectionReconfiguration
- X2-AP HandoverRequest (HandoverPreparationInformation)
- S1-AP HandoverRequired (HandoverPreparationInformation)
- S1-AP HandoverRequest (HandoverPreparationInformation)

For additional eight measurement objects, eight report configurations, and eight

measurement IDs, message size is expected to increase by less than 15 bytes in the

following messages:

- X2-AP HandoverRequestAcknowledge (RRCConnectionReconfiguration)
- S1-AP HandoverRequestAcknowledge (RRCConnectionReconfiguration)
- S1-AP HandoverCommand (RRCConnectionReconfiguration)
- Uu RRCConnectionReconfiguration at handover procedure

The improvement can increase signaling volume by the increased cardinality of

EutranFreqRelation MO.

Operation

The improvement introduces the following attributes:

- UeMeasControl.maxMeasInterFreqEUtraR12
- UeMeasControl.maxMeasInterFreqEUtraIncR12
- UeMeasControl.maxMeasEUtraOtherR12
- UeMeasControl.measScaleFactor

The improvement introduces the following event parameters that indicate support of

incMonEUTRA-r12 and extendedMaxMeasId-r12

capabilities:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_INC\_MON\_EUTRA
- EVENT\_PARAM\_EXT\_MAX\_MEASID

The improvement introduces the following event parameter that indicates whether

UeMeasControl.measScaleFactor is applied for the measurement

request:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_MEAS\_SCALE\_FACTOR

Interfaces

This improvement affects the following interfaces:

- Uu interface Introduced IEs: The incMonEUTRA-r12 and extendedMaxMeasId-r12 IEs in UE-EUTRA-Capability-v1250-IEs IE in the UECapabilityInformation message. The MeasIdToAddModListExt-r12 IE in RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages. The MeasIdToRemoveListExt-r12 IE in RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. The MeasScaleFactor-r12 IE in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. The MeasId-v1250 IE in MeasurementReport message.

- S1-AP interface Modified messages and IEs: The id-Source-ToTarget-TransparentContainer IE and id-Target-ToSource-Transparent IE are modified in the following S1 messages: HandoverRequired HandoverRequest HandoverRequestAcknowledge HandoverCommand The id-Source-ToTarget-TransparentContainer IE can contain incMonEUTRA-r12, extendedMaxMeasId-r12 and MeasIdToAddModListExt-r12 IEs in HandoverPreparationInformation message as part of the HandoverRequired and HandoverRequest messages. The id-Target-ToSource-Transparent IE can contain MeasIdToRemoveListExt-r12 IE in RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as part of HandoverRequestAcknowledge and HandoverCommand messages.
- X2-AP interface: Modified messages and IEs: The RRC-Context IE and id-TargeteNBtoSource-eNBTransparentContainer IE are modified in the following X2 messages: HandoverRequest HandoverRequestAcknowledge The RRC-Context IE can contain incMonEUTRA-r12, extendedMaxMeasId-r12 and MeasIdToAddModListExt-r12 IEs in HandoverPreparationInformation message as part of the HandoverRequest message. The id-TargeteNBtoSource-eNBTransparentContainer IE can contain MeasIdToRemoveListExt-r12 IE in RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as part of HandoverRequestAcknowledge message.
