Summary

The Cell-Level Scheduler feature supports the configuration of the scheduler of

specific cells in the eNodeB. In existing solutions scheduling is available only at

the eNodeB level. The Cell-Level Scheduler feature introduces the following

functions:

- Overriding the node-level settings of scheduling parameters, such as the scheduler algorithm and the minimum downlink bit rate
- Using different configurations for selected cells

The feature introduces the SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList

attribute to enable cell-level configuration.

Additional Information

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of Cell-Level Scheduler

First, the UE instances in the specific cells need to be grouped. Then the Cell-Level

Scheduler feature allows the QCI modification parameters of scheduling to be configured for

each cell.

Operational Process

1. Grouping UEs in specific cells The UEs are selected in a subscriber group when all the following trigger conditions are true: SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.spidTriggerList Each trigger list is evaluated independently every time the bearer of a subscriber is set up, modified, or released. Each element within a trigger list is matched irrespective of the other elements of the same list. If a subscriber matches at least one element in a trigger list, it is considered to match the whole list. An empty list matches all the subscribers. A subscriber is only selected as a member of the ASG if the subscriber matches all the lists. The AND logical connection is used to set up this trigger condition. If a subscriber fulfills more than one SubscriberGroupProfile MO, only the SubscriberGroupProfile MO with the highest priority applies. The simplest example is to configure the required cells in SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList and set empty the following attributes:SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.spidTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList Note: Category M1 and NB-IoT devices are excluded from ASGs.
2. Configuration of Cell-Level Scheduler QciProfileOperatorDefined is configured with the same setting as QciProfilePredefined for QCI 6, QCI 7, QCI 8, and QCI 9 except the select cell level scheduler parameters, for example: QciProfileOperatorDefined.schedulingAlgorithm QciProfileOperatorDefined.dlMinBitRate QciProfileOperatorDefined.ulMinBitRate QciProfileOperatorDefined.relativePriority Note: All bearers in the same cell are recommended to use the same type of scheduling strategy. That is, all bearers in the same cell use either Resource Fair scheduling or Proportional Fair scheduling. While it is possible to mix Resource Fair scheduling and Proportional Fair scheduling, this can lead to ill-conditioned system behavior and must be avoided. All cells match the SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList attribute if any of the following requirements are fulfilled: The Cell-Level Scheduler feature is deactivated. The value of the SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList attribute is empty.
3. Configuration of QCI modification parameters Each ASG profile includes four bearers to map the standardized QCI 6, QCI 7, QCI 8, and QCI 9 into the range of operator-defined QCIs. If the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is activated, QCI 65, QCI 66, QCI 69, and QCI 70 are considered when the QCIs are remapped. If the remapped QCI results in a PTT QCI, the original QCI profile is applied.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Cell-Level Scheduler

The feature must be configured for optimal operation.

To use Cell-Level Scheduler feature, at least one advanced subscriber group profile  must

be correctly configured to according to ASGH Framework.

Example 1

1. Group UE instances in specific cells in one subscriber profile as follows:
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList is empty.
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.spidTriggerList is empty.
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList is empty.
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList includes CellIds.
2. Configure Cell-Level Scheduler in QciProfileOperatorDefined class QCI 10, QCI 11, QCI 12, and QCI 13. These QCIs derive from the same setting of QciProfilePredefined of QCI 6, QCI 7, QCI 8, QCI 9 except the following cell level scheduler parameters: QciProfileOperatorDefined.schedulingAlgorithm QciProfileOperatorDefined.dlMinBitRate
3. Configure QCI modification parameters in the following way:
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI6 is 4.
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI7 is 4.
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI8 is 4.
    - SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI9 is 4.
