Summary

The feature provides support for a maximum cell range beyond 100 km for FDD. Large cells are

suitable to obtain coverage in sparsely populated areas where the need for capacity

is low. Examples of such areas are deserts, coastal areas, or sea environments.

Depending on geographical environmental characteristics and certain atmospheric

conditions, the actual cell range can optimally reach 200 km. This is double the

distance standardized by 3GPP.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Easier coverage of large rural areas
- Communication with distant nautical vessels in coastal areas
- Possibility to leverage cell capacity to gain larger coverage in various deployment scenarios
- Substantial cost reduction while maintaining LTE service in sparsely populated regions

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature is only supported for FDD.

Zone mobility is not supported. This means that if a UE moves outside the zone range,

it disconnects.

Normal handover to another cell is supported.

UEs in zone 1 and zone 2 do not support PUCCH format 2

and format 3.

Network Requirements

The UE must support 3GPP Release 8 or later.

# 3 Feature Operation of Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

The feature further extends the maximum cell range to optimally 200 km. This is twice

the distance standardized by 3GPP.

Cell range can be adjusted by setting the EUtranCellFDD.cellRange

attribute. This feature is activated when cell range is set above 100 km. The feature

selects random access preamble format 0 for cell ranges up to 15 km and format 1 for

cell ranges larger than 15 km.

During Random Access, the propagation delay between the UE and the eNodeB is measured

when the preamble is received. This propagation delay is used to calculate a Timing

Advance (TA) value, which is sent to the UE. It gives the information about how much in

advance the UE must transmit in uplink to keep uplink synchronization. The range of TA

is limited, and corresponds to 0-100 km.

This feature expands the usage of the existing TA value range by classifying UEs in

different zones based on their distance from the eNodeB. Depending on the estimated TA

value, the UE is classified in either Zone 0, Zone 1 or Zone 2 during random access.

Figure 1   Timing Advance Zones

The UE zone allocation is locked after random access, this means that the UE cannot move

to another zone. If the UE moves out of the zone range, it eventually loses uplink

synchronization and therefore it is disconnected. If this happens, the UE needs to

reconnect with a new random access procedure .

The full range of a zone corresponds to the TA range which is 100 km. The starting point

of each zone is fixed, and the zones overlap, as it can be seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Timing Advance Zone Overlap

The eNodeB monitors every UE in the cell, and it also keeps track of the zone they belong

to. Since this handling is internal in the eNodeB, the solution is backwards compatible

with the existing UE equipment.

Coverage Improvements

To improve coverage, TTI Bundling is implemented for both VoIP and data. The

following features are recommended to be turned on:

- PDCCH Power Boost
- Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling
- VoLTE Frequency Hopping

It is also recommended to configure and increase the default HARQ retransmissions in

both uplink and downlink.

Deployment Recommendations

LTE radio waves in the UHF band travel almost entirely by Line of Sight propagation

and ground reflection. Signal propagation cannot travel around the earth's curvature

and it can be obstructed or refracted both by physical obstacles like a hill or

forest, and atmospheric conditions. Deployments therefore should aim for LoS.

The following must be considered, when using this feature:

- Antennas placed high above the ground provide the best LoS.
- A radio distance approximation formula gives the cell range as follows:
equation2

![Image](../images/489_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.BF/additional_3_CP.png)
- Signals continue to propagate beyond the radio horizon, but with significantly reduced signal strength.
- NLoS region signal level is very hard to predict and therefore such deployment must be avoided.

Figure 3   Antenna Height for LOS Ratio

Assuming a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularities, if the receiver is located

above ground, this formula

can be used and ranges added.

## 3.1 DMRS-Based Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling for Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

For cells with range beyond 100 km, the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature

can only be used with DMRS-based channel quality estimation in all zones.

The channel quality estimation method that differentiates subbands in frequency domain

supports frequency-selective scheduling. The required configuration of SRS for uplink

frequency-selective scheduling is not recommended for long range cells because it

results in overall degradation for all zones. In this case, the

EUtranCellFDD.ulSrsEnable attribute must be set to

false and DMRS in PUSCH reception can be used for subband channel

estimation.

The DMRS-based uplink frequency-selective scheduling can be provided for all zones in

long range cells if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km feature is activated.
- The Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature is enabled.
- Any of the UE active bearers has a QCI profile with the QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy attribute set to FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE.
- Available DMRS resources are provided.

DMRS resources control memory consumption by limiting the maximum number of UEs that can

use subband PUSCH channel estimation. The conditions are evaluated at each activation of

a new bearer or a new SCell. After the resource is assigned, the pool of the remaining

DMRS resources is reduced by one on both cell and node level.

For DMRS-based channel estimation, the following resources can be available:

- The maximum number of DMRS users for a cell can amount up to 100.
- The maximum number of DMRS users for a Baseband unit can amount up to 505 depending on hardware.

If the maximum number of DMRS users is exceeded, the average channel quality

estimation is used.

# 4 Network Impact of Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

The feature impacts uplink and downlink capacity and throughput. It also limits the

number of maximum possible cells in certain cases.

Capacity and Performance

Uplink capacity is reduced because more uplink resources are reserved for PRACH and

PUCCH.

Downlink throughput in zone 0 decreases because of the need for scheduling

multiplexing between zones.

The number of supported cells on an eNodeB also decreases because there is a need for

increased processing power. Each cell with a cell range greater than 100 km can be

traded against a cell capacity corresponding to the processing power of two 100 km

cells. So if all cells are greater than 100 km on an eNodeB, the supported number of

cells on that eNodeB will be half compared to an eNodeB with only 100 km cells.

The frequency-selective scheduling increases data throughput in long range cells.

Optimized memory consumption enables more users to benefit from the DMRS-based than

from the SRS-based channel quality estimation.

Interfaces

If the cell range exceeds 100 km, the following interfaces are impacted:

- LPP The ue-RxTxTimeDiff measurement information reported from the UE over LPP is based on the TA value received from the eNodeB, which cannot give a correct position estimate for the UEs in zone 1 or zone 2.
- LPPa TA type 1 and TA type 2 are both compensated depending on the zone, to give a value corresponding to the real distance. A larger value is received for any UE outside the range of 100 km.
- MAC A modified TA value is sent to any UE in zone 1 and zone 2.

Other Network Elements

- E-SMLC The downlink procedure to obtain E-CID over LPP directly from the UE does not work with this feature, since the reported TA value from a UE in zone 1 or zone 2 cannot be translated to a correct propagation distance. To get correct E-CID positioning data, it is recommended that the E-SMLC requests it from the eNodeB over the LPPa protocol. This is supported by the LPPa-based E-CID Support feature.

# 5 Parameters for Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

The feature is configurable by parameters related to cell range, PUCCH resources, TTI

bundling and HARQ transmission.

| UL Throughput                 | PUCCH needs more radio resources at the expense of PUSCH. UL                                     throughput decreases in the entire cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| DL Throughput                 | DL throughput decreases because of scheduling limitation in the                                     entire cell when there are UEs in different zones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Latency                       | If there are UEs in outer zones, latency increases in general                                     because of zone handling in the scheduler. In outer zones, the                                     latency is even higher, because there is higher pathloss and a                                     larger amount of retransmissions and HARQ failures.  VoLTE related KPIs are affected by increased latency. |

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q4: Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling Support for Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km

The feature enhancement enables uplink DMRS to support the required channel quality

estimation and the uplink frequency-selective scheduling for cell range up to 200

km.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                           |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables DMRS-based uplink frequency-selective scheduling

configuration for cell range up to 200 km. However, the actual coverage possibility

depends on geographic environments and atmospheric conditions. In heavy traffic

mode, the feature enhancement might not be able to limit the maximum number of

scheduling users properly in one TTI if the cell range is configured to 200 km. As a

result, the eNodeB might crash.

The feature enhancement also improves the DMRS so that it can provide average subband

channel estimation for all zones.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved performance throughput at the cell edge
- Improved uplink cell throughput
- DMRS-based channel estimation without the risk of collisions or degradation in outer zones

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement provides increased data throughput in long range cells.

Optimized memory consumption enables more users to benefit from better channel

quality estimation.

For DMRS-based channel estimation, the following resources can be available:

- The maximum number of DMRS users for a cell can amount up to 100.
- The maximum number of DMRS users for a Baseband unit can amount up to 505 depending on hardware.

If the maximum number of DMRS users is exceeded, the average channel quality

estimation is used.

The cell capacity might be affected if the maximum cell range increases.

The observability of benefits depends on channel conditions.

The feature enhancement increases the Average UL MAC Cell Throughput KPI.

The following PIs are affected by the feature enhancement:

- Spectral Efficiency of PRB Payload increases.
- UL HARQ BLER decreases.

Operation

For the operation of the feature enhancement, the Uplink Frequency-Selective

Scheduling feature and the Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km feature must be

enabled.

DMRS resources are assigned to the UE only if any of its active bearers has a QCI

profile with the QciProfilePredefined.resourceAllocationStrategy

attribute set to FREQUENCY\_SELECTIVE.

SRS is not supported with this feature enhancement, therefore, the

EUtranCellFDD.ulSrsEnable attribute must be set to

false for long range cells.

If the VoLTE Frequency Hopping feature is also enabled in the cell, VoLTE UEs cannot

use the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature and the VoLTE Frequency

Hopping feature at the same time. Therefore, no additional benefits can be expected

for VoLTE users if both features are activated in a cell.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                          |

Summary and Benefits

For long range cells, this feature enhancement ensures that the number of scheduling

users in one subframe does not exceed the maximum limit.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved network stability
- Improved operation in zone 1 and zone 2

Capacity and Performance

In heavy traffic, UEs can experience improved network stability. The number of RRC

connected users and the uplink cell throughput might also improve.

Operation

The number of PUCCH-pairs reserved for the scheduling request from UEs located in the

outer zones must be two. Therefore, the  value of the

EUtranCellFDD.noOfOuterZoneSrPrbPairs attribute must be set

to 2.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves the deployment flexibility of the Flexible Uplink

Processing and the Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km features by supporting their

coexistence.

This feature enhancement extends the following benefits of the Flexible Uplink

Processing feature to eNodeBs that are configured with long range cells:

- Improved PUCCH PRB Pair (PPP) utilization
- Increased PUCCH capacity
- Increased system robustness

Capacity and Performance

The following PM counters can be used to observe the increased PUCCH capacity which

results from the improved PPP utilization:

- BbProcessingResource.pmPucchSrResCongBbm
- BbProcessingResource.pmPucchSrResUtilBbm
- BbProcessingResource.pmPucchCqiResCongBbm
- BbProcessingResource.pmPucchCqiResUtilBbm
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrCqiResCongSr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrCqiResCongCqi

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchCqiResLongUtilCell
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrResShortUtilCell
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrResMediumUtilCell
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrResLongUtilCell
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnMax

The following PM counters can show the impact on PUSCH capacity which results from

PUCCH-PUSCH trading:

- BbProcessingResource.pmLicUlPrbUsedSum
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPrbUtilUlDistr

Operation

If the Maximum Cell Range beyond 100 km feature is enabled, the number of additional

PPPs in the outer zones must be considered during the calculation of the total

number of configured PPPs at cell setup. The number of PPPs in the outer zones

equals the value of the EUtranCellFDD.noOfOuterZoneSrPrbPairs

attribute plus four. The additional four PPPs are used for PUCCH HARQ resources.

The SR PUCCH consumption of the UEs in the outer zones is not included in the values

of the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers
- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsersCalc
- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchFormat1PrbPairsPerFrame
- EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchFormat1PrbPairsPerFrameConf
