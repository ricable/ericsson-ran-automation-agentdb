# 1 Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration Overview

The feature provides improved uplink throughput for UEs with continuous and heavy uplink

traffic by configuring up to one uplink SCell for  carrier aggregation.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature detects uplink-heavy UEs, and attempts to configure uplink carrier

aggregation for them by configuring up to one uplink SCell. As a result, increased

uplink throughput for such UEs can be expected.

The uplink component carriers or uplink SCells that might provide the best

performance can be prioritized.

The main benefit of the feature is improved uplink data rate for UEs. An extra

benefit is dynamic SCell selection for uplink carrier aggregation.

In addition, the feature provides a node-level  configuration option for quickly

transferring from uplink-preferred carrier aggregation to downlink-preferred carrier

aggregation configuration after the UE exits the uplink-heavy state.

Additional Information

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration

The feature detects uplink-heavy UEs, and attempts to configure an uplink carrier

aggregation SCell for them.

Operational Process

1. Uplink-heavy UE detection The node periodically probes the estimated buffer size of UEs to search for uplink-heavy UEs. If the buffer size is above a configured threshold, it detects the UE as uplink-heavy. If the buffer size of an uplink-heavy UE falls under a configured threshold, it detects it as not uplink-heavy.
2. SCell selection and configuration The system selects an uplink SCell candidate for carrier aggregation configuration.

## 3.1 Uplink-heavy UE Detection

Detection conditions are controlled by attributes introduced by the

feature.

For the uplink-heavy UE detection, the node uses thresholds determined by the

following attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThUlCaFactor
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTime
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTimeOffset

Entry Conditions of Uplink-Heavy Status

The eNodeB probes the estimated buffer size of each UE periodically. If the buffer

size is higher than the sum of the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh, and the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst attributes, a detection

window starts. The length of the detection window is the value of the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTime attribute. If the buffer

size remains higher than the threshold condition during the detection window, the UE

is detected as uplink-heavy by the node.

For a UE that is detected as uplink-heavy, the periodic probing starts again after an

internal timer runs out. If the UE does not fulfill the uplink-heavy requirement,

the node continues the periodic probing.

Exit Conditions of Uplink-Heavy Status

For an uplink-heavy UE with an active uplink SCell, a detection window starts if the

following condition is true:

| EstBuffSize              |    | Estimated buffer size of the UE.                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                     |
| ulHeavyUeBsrThresh       |    | The value of the ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh                                 attribute.                                       |
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                     |
| ulHeavyUeBsrThUlCaFactor |    | The value of the                                 ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThUlCaFactor                                 attribute. |
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                     |
| ulHeavyUeBsrHyst         |    | The value of the ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst                                 attribute.                                         |

If an uplink-heavy UE is not configured for uplink carrier aggregation, or has a

deactivated uplink SCell, a detection window starts if the estimated buffer size is

lower than the difference of the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrThresh, and the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeBsrHyst attributes.

The length of the detection window is the sum of the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTime, and the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyUeDetectTimeOffset attributes. If the

buffer size remains lower than the threshold conditions during the detection window,

the UE is detected as not uplink-heavy by the node. If the UE does not fulfill the

non-uplink-heavy requirement, the node continues the periodic probing and continues

to consider the UE as uplink-heavy.

## 3.2 SCell Selection and Configuration

The system selects and configures an uplink SCell candidate for carrier aggregation

configuration.

SCell selection is based on the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation

feature.

When the Global SCell Evaluation feature is used, SCell selection is based on legacy

configuration, and is prioritized for uplink SCells. The eNodeB re-evaluates the band

combination, using the following fixed values, regardless of the value set by the

operator:

- Value 99 for the CarrierAggregationFunction.selectionPolicyUlWeighting attribute
- Value EFFECTIVE for the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellEvaluationLevel attribute

For more information, see Global SCell Evaluation.

When the Global SCell Evaluation feature is not used, an overview of the SCell selection

procedure is shown in Figure 2. The system selects uplink SCell for an uplink-heavy UE using the following

process:

1. Check if an uplink SCell is configured. If it is configured, no more action is taken.
2. Check if a configured SCell supports uplink carrier aggregation. If there is an uplink carrier aggregation-capable SCell configured for the UE, the system releases it, then adds it as uplink and downlink SCell. If there are more than one candidate SCells, the system selects one randomly. If the configuration is successful, no more action is taken.
3. Check if an uplink SCell can be added. The candidate SCell must support uplink carrier aggregation, and the current carrier aggregation configuration. If a candidate SCell fulfills these conditions, the system adds the SCell as uplink and downlink SCell. If the configuration is successful, no more action is taken.
4. Check if a current SCell can be swapped for a candidate SCell. The system selects an uplink SCell candidate from the configured frequencies of SCell candidates. If no uplink SCell candidate is available on the configured SCell frequencies, the system searches for an uplink SCell in frequencies that are not configured. The system can swap one or more SCells from the current configuration to one or more candidate SCells. If the configuration is successful, no more action is taken.

### 3.2.1 Uplink SCell Prioritization for UEs in Uplink-Heavy State

If the uplink carrier aggregation configuration or reconfiguration is triggered when

the UE enters the uplink-heavy state, uplink SCell priority can be considered to improve the

uplink performance.

The operator can configure the prioritization of specific uplink SCells and uplink SCell

carriers that might provide the best uplink performance when the UE enters the

uplink-heavy state.

For the uplink priority configuration, both the Configurable SCell Priority and the

Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration features must be enabled.

To enable the prioritization of specific SCells and SCell carriers when the UE enters the

uplink-heavy state, the ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyCaReconfMode attribute

must be set to ULPRIORITY and the following attributes must be

configured:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulCaPrioThreshold or EUtranCellTDD.ulCaPrioThreshold
- EUtranCellFDD.ulSCellPriority or EUtranCellTDD.ulSCellPriority
- EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqPriority
- EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqProportion

If the Global SCell Evaluation feature is also enabled with the Configurable SCell

Priority and the Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration features, the

CarrierAggregationFunction.useAbsolutePrioForCspEffBw attribute

is automatically set to false, regardless

of the value set by the operator. The prioritization of specific

uplink SCells and SCell carriers can still be configured.

### 3.2.2 Load Distribution between Uplink Carrier Frequencies and Uplink SCell Candidates

The load distribution considers the current and the maximum number of uplink SCell

configurations to balance the UE load on the uplink SCells. This could optimize the uplink

performance of SCells and SCell carriers.

The load balancing uses a credit handling algorithm.

If both the Configurable SCell Priority and the Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation features

are activated,

the

priority of uplink SCell or SCell carriers can be configured. The

maximum

number of credits can be set by the operator.

Each uplink SCell

configuration uses

up

one uplink credit. The uplink SCell with

the

highest priority is selected.

First, the value of the EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqPriority attribute

is

checked.

Then, if the value is the same for more than one

SCell

candidates, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulSCellPriority or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulSCellPriority attribute is also

checked.

When the uplink credits are used up on a high priority frequency, the next lower

prioritized frequency with uplink credits

left

is used.

An

uplink SCell is excluded from the evaluation when all uplink credits for an uplink SCell

are used up.

If the Configurable SCell Priority feature is not enabled, the uplink credit for

frequency and the uplink credit for uplink SCell are considered as an average.

The maximum uplink credit can be greater than or equal to zero, and can be calculated as

shown in the following equations:

Figure 3   Maximum Uplink Credit for One Frequency

Figure 4   Maximum Uplink Credit for One Uplink SCell

where the values are defined according to the following equations:

Figure 5   Normalized ulCaFreqProportion(fx)

Figure 6   Normalized ulScellPriority(ulScellY)

The uplink SCell credits are recalculated without locking and unlocking the PCell. The

existing credits for each uplink SCell relation for each frequency are considered during

recalculation. The following operations trigger credit recalculation:

- Changing any of the following parameters: EUtranCellFDD.ulCaPrioThreshold or EUtranCellTDD.ulCaPrioThreshold EUtranCellFDD.ulSCellPriority or EUtranCellTDD.ulSCellPriority EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqPriority EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqProportion
- Adding or removing the EUtranFreqRelation MO with an uplink SCell candidate
- Adding or removing an uplink SCell candidate on the existing EUtranFreqRelation MO instance
- Configured or changed prioritization of SCells or SCells carriers

### 3.2.3 Accelerated Transfer to Downlink-Preferred Carrier Aggregation

The operator can configure if the UE keeps the existing carrier aggregation

configuration after the UE exits the uplink-heavy state, or if reconfiguration is needed for

the optimized downlink performance.

To enable the quick transfer to the downlink-preferred carrier aggregation when the UE

exits

theuplink-heavy

state, the value of the ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyExitCaMode attribute

must be set to BACK\_TO\_DLCA.

# 4 Network Impact of Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration

The feature improves the

uplink

carrier aggregation throughput of the network, but does not

take

the downlink capacity into account.

Capacity and Performance

By configuring uplink SCells for uplink-heavy UEs, the average UE and cell uplink

throughput are improved.

The feature provides a configuration option for transferring the UE to

downlink-preferred carrier aggregation as soon as possible after the UE exits the

uplink-heavy state. This way, the downlink throughput degradation might be

mitigated.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration

The feature is affected by parameters for configuring uplink-heavy UE detection, and

it introduces new parameters for detailed configuration.

Counters

The following counters are introduced to observe events related to

uplink

SCell configuration:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnReconfAttNoMobDacc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnReconfSuccNoMobDacc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnReconfAttNoMobDacc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnReconfSuccNoMobDacc

If the prioritization of specific SCells and uplink SCell carriers is configured at

entering the uplink-heavy state, the following counters might increase:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfiguredUlSum
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCaConfiguredUlSum

If the UE is transferred from uplink-preferred carrier aggregation to

downlink-preferred carrier aggregation configuration after the UE exits the

uplink-heavy state, the following PM counters might increase:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfiguredDlSum
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCaConfiguredDlSum

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the configurable prioritization of specific uplink

SCells and uplink SCell carriers that might provide the best performance when the UE

enters the uplink-heavy state.

Also, the feature enhancement provides a node-level

configuration

option for transferring from uplink-preferred carrier aggregation

to downlink-preferred carrier aggregation configuration quickly after the UE exits

the uplink-heavy state.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits on the node level:

- Flexible configuration for uplink SCell or SCell carrier priority
- Improved downlink UE throughput

Capacity and Performance

The performance of this feature enhancement might be observed through the following

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfiguredDlSum
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCaConfiguredDlSum
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfiguredUlSum
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCaConfiguredUlSum

If the priority for uplink SCells and uplink SCell carriers is considered for better

uplink performance, the following KPIs might increase when the UE enters the

uplink-heavy state:

- Average UL PDCP UE Throughput
- Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput

If the UE is transferred from uplink-preferred carrier aggregation to

downlink-preferred carrier aggregation configuration after the UE exits the

uplink-heavy state, the following KPIs might be affected:

- The Average DL PDCP UE Throughput KPI might increase.
- The Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput KPI might increase.
- The Average UL PDCP UE Throughput KPI might decrease.
- The Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput KPI might decrease.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyCaReconfMode
- ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyExitCaMode
- EUtranCellFDD.ulCaPrioThreshold
- EUtranCellTDD.ulCaPrioThreshold
- EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqPriority
- EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqProportion

This feature enhancement modifies the following attributes through providing

configuration options for the Data-Aware Carrier Aggregation Configuration

feature:

- EUtranCellFDD.ulSCellPriority
- EUtranCellTDD.ulSCellPriority

To enable the prioritization of specific SCells and SCell carriers when the UE enters

the uplink-heavy state, the following conditions must be met:

- The Configurable SCell Priority feature must be operational.
- The ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyCaReconfMode attribute must be set to ULPRIORITY.
- The following attributes must be configured: EUtranCellFDD.ulCaPrioThreshold or EUtranCellTDD.ulCaPrioThreshold EUtranCellFDD.ulSCellPriority or EUtranCellTDD.ulSCellPriority EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqPriority EUtranFreqRelation.ulCaFreqProportion

To enable the quick transfer to the downlink-preferred carrier aggregation when the

UE exits uplink-heavy state, the value of the

ENodeBFunction.ulHeavyExitCaMode attribute must be set to

BACK\_TO\_DLCA.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version

24.4

or later to support the MOM changes by this feature enhancement. If the Release

Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes and counter changes are

supported on earlier ENM versions also.
