Summary

With the High Power UE feature, significant network deployment savings can be achieved, as the

feature increases uplink coverage and uplink edge throughput by supporting high

power UEs with power value higher than the standard 23 dBm of power class 3 UEs.

Power

class 1 UEs are supported on the E-UTRAN frequency band 14 in FDD mode, and Power

class 2 UEs are supported on E-UTRAN frequency band 41 in TDD mode, as defined in

3GPP TS 36.101. So it is possible for a UE to have a different

power class on a specific E-UTRAN band.

The feature supports high power UE capabilities on the primary frequency band as well

as on additional frequency bands.

Since the maximum output power of UEs differs depending on the UE power class, the

node dynamically handles UEs depending on the uplink power capability. This enables

the node to provide better link adaptation, coverage, throughput, and mobility,

improving UE and network performance.

The feature provides configuration to support high power UE capability for UEs that

do not support simultaneous high power and Carrier Aggregation configuration. This

is achieved by prioritizing the high power UE capability over uplink and downlink

Carrier Aggregation band combinations that are inappropriate for transmission with

higher power.

The feature enables the node to switch dynamically between carrier aggregation and

high power UE support based on filtered maximum SINR for DMRS measurements. This

allows to keep the benefits of uplink carrier aggregation in good radio conditions,

and to extend uplink coverage by supporting high power UE capabilities in bad radio

conditions. This also compensates power splitting between UEs by uplink carrier

aggregation.

The feature enables to control mobility per UE power class. This is achieved by

configurable measurement threshold offset for each frequency relation differentiated

per UE power class.

The feature enables the operator to monitor differentiated mobility and other KPIs

based on UE power classes. This is achieved by using flexible counters with a filter

for power classes.

Additional Information

UE power classes are described in 3GPP TS 36.101 (User Equipment radio transmission

and reception). For further information, see 3GPP TS 36.133 (Requirements for

support of radio resource management), and 3GPP TS 36.331 (Radio Resource Control

(RRC); Protocol specification).

An active High Power UE Enhancements for Band 14 enhancement enables High Power UE

support to FDD band 14 for Power Class 1 UEs.

# 2 Dependencies of High Power UE

The feature has dependencies with other features related to power control, uplink

carrier aggregation, and mobility.

Features

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The UE must support high power capabilities.

# 3 Feature Operation of High Power UE

Once high power UEs are supported on a specific frequency band, to improve UE and network

performance, the node considers the maximum allowed UE output power per UE power class.

Also, when Carrier Aggregation is used, the node takes into account any restrictions on

carrier aggregation configuration that depends on the UE power class on each serving

frequency band.

This is a licensed feature, so it can only be activated when the service state is

OPERABLE.

When the High Power UE feature is enabled, the following procedure is applied in the initial

connection setup, at incoming handover, and at RRC connection re-establishment.

Operational Process

Figure 1   High Power UE Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The node checks which UE power class is supported by the UE on the primary frequency band of the serving cell, and sets the UE power class to the highest possible. The UE power class of the UE is reset to the default power class 3 in the following cases: If the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is used, the node also checks which UE power class is supported on additional frequency bands of the serving cell. This is done by checking SIB1 messages broadcasting the operator-configured network signaling values additionalNSvalue and maximum output power additionalPMax for each available additionalFreqBand in MultipleNSPmaxReqMapping connected to attribute EUtranCellFDD.multipleNSPmaxReqMapping or EUtranCellTDD.multipleNSPmaxReqMapping. The node stores the UE power class information in the UE Context.
    - The High Power UE feature is not enabled.
    - Any of the information elements does not exist.
    - The MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell or EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell is not configured.
    - The MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell belonging to frequency band 14 or EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell belonging to frequency band 41 is set to the value 23, or lower.
    - The MO attribute EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment is set to 0 or 6.
2. The UE power value determined by the UE power class is used as the maximum output power allowed for the UE to transmit in the PCell. Note: At RRC connection re-establishment the maximum output power can be modified due to the combination of the type of Carrier Aggregation configuration and the UE power class on the PCell.
3. If Carrier Aggregation is used, the proper type of carrier aggregation configuration is chosen based on the UE power class on the PCell and the MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.prioHpueCapability or EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability. When the EUtranCellFDD.prioHpueCapability, or the EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability attribute is set to PRIORITIZE\_IN\_CA, no uplink SCell component is considered for high power UEs that are not capable of simultaneous high power and uplink carrier aggregation. Also, only such downlink SCell combinations are selected that allow the preservation of high power capability. When the EUtranCellFDD.prioHpueCapability, or the EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability attribute is set to NO\_PRIORITIZATION, the node dynamically switches between carrier aggregation and high power UE support. Dynamic switching is based on time normalized filtered uplink SINR measurements for DMRS, and controlled by the following attributes: EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchThres EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger The carrier aggregation configuration can have the following types: The node stores the type of carrier aggregation configuration in the UE Context.
    - No Carrier Aggregation mode
    - Intra-band downlink only mode
    - Inter-band downlink only mode
    - Intra-band mode
    - Inter-band mode
4. The node determines the actual UE power value based on the carrier aggregation configuration and the UE power class on each serving cell.
5. If any uplink SCell is configured, the UE power class is checked on the primary band of the SCells. The node signals the actual UE power value and UE power class on each serving SCell. The actual power value is determined on each SCell from a local mapping table of power value for each power class. Note: If MO attribute EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell belonging to the frequency band 41 is set to the value 23, or lower, or the MO attribute EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment is set to 0 or 6, default values are used for UE power value and SCell power class. If MO attribute EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell belonging to the frequency band 14 is set to the value 23, or lower, default values are used for UE power value and SCell power class. On band 41, A-MPR table (3GPP TS 36.101) is supported for network signaling value (EUtranCellFDD.networkSignallingValue or EUtranCellTDD.networkSignallingValue) set to NS\_04 with UE power class 2 and 3.

## 3.1 UE Power Classes

Five UE power classes are defined in 3GPP TS 36.101. Without the High Power UE feature,

only power class 3 is supported.

Table 2   UE Power Classes On the Node

|   Power Class | Maximum Output Power  [dBm]   | Description                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|             1 | 31                            | High power UE                                      |
|             2 | 26                            | High power UE                                      |
|             3 | 23                            | The default UE power class                         |
|             4 | 23                            | Not yet defined in 3GPP                            |
|             5 | 23(1)                         | Supported only on certain E-UTRAN frequency bands. |

(1)

In 3GPP, the maximum output power is defined as 20 dBm for

this power class.

The High Power UE feature makes it possible for a UE to have a different power class on a

specific E-UTRAN frequency band.

Figure 2   Uplink Coverage Depending on UE Power Class

## 3.2 Mobility Threshold Offset Differentiated per UE Power Class

When the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage and the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility

features are active together with the High Power UE feature, different mobility

threshold offsets can be set for different UE power classes. The affected mobility

thresholds are the A2 critical, A5 T1 and T2, and the B2 T1 event thresholds.

It is recommended to set the offsets for high power UEs for these downlink RSRP or RSRQ

thresholds to align with the extended uplink coverage of the high power UE

capability.

These differentiated threshold offsets are used in the following four scenarios:

- UE is camping on a cell supporting high power functionality: The A2 critical threshold is by default aligned with the cell range of default power class. This means that without the added offset, the high power UE can be transferred to another RAT network when switching to high power mode. To prevent this, it is recommended to set a different A2 critical threshold offset for high power UEs.
- The UE is moving from a cell supporting high power functionality to one that does not support it: to ensure that the UE stays on the high power supporting cell for longer, it is recommended to set a different A5 T1 or B2 T1 threshold offset for high power UEs.
- The UE is moving from a cell not supporting high power functionality to one that supports it: to ensure that the cell is transferred to the high power supporting cell earlier, it is recommended to set a different A5 T2 threshold offset for high power UEs.
- The UE is moving between cells that both support high power functionality: without added offset, a situation can happen when the UE is transferred repeatedly between the two cells. To prevent this, it is recommended to set different threshold offsets for high power UEs for both the A5 T1 and T2 thresholds.

Figure 3   Scenarios for Mobility Threshold Offset Differentiated per UE Power Class

The following criteria is used to determine whether a cell supports high power

functionality:

- For the source cell: The value of the EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell or EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell attribute for band 41 or band 14 is higher than 23 if band 41 or band 14 is the primary band. The value of the EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell or additionalPMax member of the MultipleNSPmaxReqMapping structure referenced by the EUtranCellTDD.multipleNSPmaxReqMapping attribute for band 41 or band 14 is higher than 23 if band 41 or band 14 is an additional band.
- For the target cell: Cell has band 41. Cell has Band 14. The value of the EUtranFreqRelation.pMax attribute on the source cell is higher than 23.

# 4 Network Impact

Capacity and Performance

The feature enables support for high power UEs to enhance the uplink performance for

them.

| Function          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uplink coverage   | When the High Power UE feature is enabled, uplink coverage is                                         extended for high power UEs.                                                                                                   |
| Uplink throughput | It is expected that uplink edge throughput is improved. This                                         is achieved by Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility                                         reflecting the UE power class. |

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for High Power UE

Maximum Allowed Output Power of the UE on the Cell

To enable high power UEs on a cell on frequency band

14 or 41, the MOM attribute

EUtranCellFDD.pMaxServingCell or EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell

must be set to a value higher than 23, representing the output power 23

dBm.

Priority for High Power UEs over Carrier Aggregation

To prioritize the high power UE capability over uplink and downlink carrier

aggregation band combinations that are inappropriate for transmission with higher

power, the MO attribute

EUtranCellFDD.prioHpueCapability or EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability

must be set to PRIORITIZE\_IN\_CA.

Dynamic Switching between Carrier Aggregation and High Power UE

To allow dynamic switching between carrier aggregation and high power UE support,

attribute

EUtranCellFDD.prioHpueCapability or --&gt;EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability

must be set to NO\_PRIORITIZATION.

Dynamic switching is based on time normalized filtered uplink SINR measurements for

DMRS, and controlled by the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchThres
- EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres
- EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst
- EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst
- EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger
- EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger

## 9.1 Monitoring Benefits of High Power UE

Monitoring Improved Uplink Edge Throughput

![Image](../images/346_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.BY/additional_3_CP.png)

When uplink edge throughput is improved, Uplink HARQ Success Rate is increased due to

the increased number of success count for each modulation, and Uplink HARQ BLER is

decreased.

![Image](../images/346_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.BY/additional_3_CP.png)

Uplink coverage is extended and uplink throughput is increased by moving high power

UEs to target cells where high power operation is allowed. This is achieved by the

Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature. This can be monitored by an

increase in the Success Rate of Handover Preparation by Uplink-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Mobility.

## 9.2 Configuring Dynamic Switching Between Carrier Aggregation and High Power UE Capability

When the EUtranCellFDD.prioHpueCapability, or

the EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability attribute is set to

NO\_PRIORITIZATION, the node dynamically switches between

carrier aggregation and high power UE support. Dynamic switching is based on time

normalized filtered uplink SINR measurements for DMRS, and controlled by the

following attributes:

- EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres
- EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchThres
- EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst
- EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst
- EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger
- EUtranCellFDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger

## 9.3 Configuring High Power UE on Additional Frequency Band

To enable supporting high power UE capability on additional frequency bands, the

network signaling values and the maximum output power for each additional frequency band

must be broadcast in SIB1 messages. This requires the following configuration.

The network signaling values additionalNSvalue and maximum output

power additionalPMax for each available

additionalFreqBand in MultipleNSPmaxReqMapping

connected to attribute EUtranCellFDD.multipleNSPmaxReqMapping or

EUtranCellTDD.multipleNSPmaxReqMapping must be configured. If

this is done, the

EUtranCellFDD.additionalMultipleNSPmaxEUtranCellTDD.additionalMultipleNSPmax

attributes are automatically updated.

The function requires also that the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is enabled

and configured.

## 9.4 Configuring Mobility Measurement Threshold Offset per UE Power Class

When this feature is active, the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility feature can set

different offsets for the A2 critical, A5 T1 and T2, and B2 T1 measurement thresholds

depending on UE power class.

Figure 4   Mobility Measurement Threshold Offset per UE Power Class

For example, when the high power UE has several QCIs and triggers A5 measurement, then the

offset is applied to the A5 T1 threshold as follows:

The other thresholds that are differentiated by UE power class are calculated

similarly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q3: Dynamic Switching Between Carrier Aggregation and High Power UE

This enhancement enables the node to switch dynamically between carrier aggregation and high

power UE support.

| Feature Name:           | High Power UE                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4762 R3                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R12                   |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement enables the node to switch dynamically between carrier aggregation and high

power UE support based on filtered maximum SINR for DMRS measurements. This allows to

keep the benefits of uplink carrier aggregation in good radio conditions, and to extend

uplink coverage by supporting high power UE capabilities in bad radio conditions. This

also compensates power splitting between UEs by uplink carrier aggregation.

The A-MPR table (3GPP TS 36.101) for network signaling value

(EUtranCellTDD.networkSignallingValue) set to

NS\_04 with UE power class 2 and 3 on band 41 is also

supported.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The introduced dynamic switching function between carrier aggregation and high power

UE support requires the following:

- The following features are activated: Carrier Aggregation Uplink Carrier Aggregation Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation
- Attribute EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability is set to NO\_PRIOTIZATION.
- The following MO attributes are configured to control dynamic switching between carrier aggregation and high power UE support: EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger

One new PM Event is introduced to observe switching between carrier aggregation and

high power UE support:

- EVENT\_VALUE\_HPUE\_DYN\_SWITCH

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- UE UEs must support high power capabilities.

## Appendix A.b: UE Power Class Based Mobility Optimization

This enhancement enables support for high power UEs on additional frequency bands,

and mobility measurement threshold offsets differentiated by UE power class.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R12                   |
| Feature Name:           | High Power UE                      |
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4762 R3                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node |

This enhancement enables support of high power UE capability on additional frequency band

by supporting multiple network signaling values and maximum output power per additional

frequency band. The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators Priority feature must be enabled

for this functionality.

It also provides a configurable measurement threshold offset per UE power class. This

makes it possible to tune downlink coverage for high power UEs to align it with the

extended uplink coverage. The benefits of using these offsets can be observed when the

following criteria are met:

- The EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqMeasType or EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqMeasTypeUlSinr attribute is set to EVENT\_A5, which means A5 type measurements are used for inter-frequency mobility.
- The A5 thresholds related to the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility or the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature are properly set.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following new MO attributes are introduced to control high power UE support on

additional frequency band:

- EUtranCellTDD.additionalMultipleNSPmax
- EUtranCellTDD.multipleNSPmaxReqMapping

The following new MO attributes are introduced to control mobility of UEs per UE

power class:

- EUtranFreqRelation.a5OffsetPerPC
- GeranFreqGroupRelation.b2GeranOffsetPerPC
- UtranFreqRelation.b2UtranOffsetPerPC
- ReportConfigSearch.a2CriticalOffsetPerPC
- Cdma2000FreqRelation.b2Cdma2000OffsetPerPC

To fully benefit from this enhancement, cells on the same frequency are recommended

to have the same EUtranCellTDD.pMaxServingCell value, because

EUtranFreqRelation.pMax is set per frequency relation, not

per each cell relation.

Interfaces

This change affects the following interfaces:

- SIB1 New information element for NS-Pmax list for additional band.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- UE UEs must support high power capabilities, and to support the MFBI feature, must have FGI bit 31 set to 1, see 3GPP TS 36.331, Annex B.1.
