Summary

The Configurable Distribution Counters feature provides counters for the following purposes:

- The counters collect downlink PRB use distribution information for each measurement cell group, which consists of a set of cells or a group of UEs in a set of cells. In contrast, the BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlPrbCapDistr and the BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlPrbUsedDistr legacy downlink PRB use distribution counters are measured only on Baseband level.
- The counters collect downlink and uplink UE throughput distribution information for each measurement cell group differentiated by PLMN or SPID.Note: The following legacy downlink and uplink UE throughput distribution counters are measured only at the cell level: EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThp2DlDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThp2DlDistr EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThp2UlDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThp2UlDistr

This feature has the following benefits:

- It provides downlink PRB use distribution information in finer granularity.
- It allows the measurement of downlink and uplink UE throughput distribution in a group of cells differentiated by PLMN or SPID.

# 3 Feature Operation of Configurable Distribution Counters

This feature configures measurement cell groups as a set of cells or as a group of UEs

in a set of cells by using appropriate MO attributes.

Measurement Cell Group Configuration

The Configurable Distribution Counters feature defines a measurement cell group

configured by the MeasCellGroup MO. Each

MeasCellGroup MO instance represents a measurement cell

group.

One of the options to configure a measurement cell group is as a set of cells. This

is called cell slicing measurement cell group. All cells that belong to a cell

slicing measurement cell group refer to a MeasCellGroup MO

instance using either the EUtranCellFDD.measCellGroupCellRef or

the EUtranCellTDD.measCellGroupCellRef attribute. Both the

MeasCellGroup.plmnList and

MeasCellGroup.spidList attribute must be empty. Figure 1 illustrates an example of how to

configure a cell slicing measurement cell group using the

MeasCellGroup MO.

Figure 1   Cell

Slicing Measurement Cell Group Configuration

Another option is to configure a measurement cell group as a group of UEs in a set of

cells. This is called UE slicing measurement cell group. All cells belonging to a UE

slicing measurement cell group refer to a MeasCellGroup MO

instance using either the EUtranCellFDD.measCellGroupUeRef or the

EUtranCellTDD.measCellGroupUeRef attribute. Each cell can

have up to six UE slicing measurement cell groups and each UE can belong to maximum

one UE slicing measurement cell group.

A UE slicing measurement cell group differentiates UEs by either the list of PLMNs or

the list of SPIDs. The list of PLMNs belonging to a PLMN UE slicing measurement cell

group which differentiates UEs by PLMN can be set by using

MeasCellGroup.plmnList. The list of SPIDs included in a SPID

UE slicing measurement cell group which differentiates UEs by SPID can be set by

using MeasCellGroup.spidList. Both the

MeasCellGroup.plmnList and

MeasCellGroup.spidList attribute must be empty.

Figure 2 illustrates an example of how to

configure a PLMN UE slicing measurement cell group using the

MeasCellGroup MO.

Figure 2   PLMN UE Slicing Measurement Cell Group Configuration

Figure 3 illustrates an example of how to

configure a SPID UE slicing measurement cell group using the

MeasCellGroup MO.

Figure 3   SPID UE Slicing Measurement Cell Group Configuration

As seen in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the

EUtranCellFDD.measCellGroupUeRef or the

EUtranCellTDD.measCellGroupUeRef attribute has to refer to

the same type of UE slicing measurement cell groups. This means that a

EUtranCellFDD or a EUtranCellTDD MO cannot

refer to PLMN UE slicing measurement cell group and SPID UE slicing measurement cell

group at the same time.

For carrier aggregation, the groupId of the UE slicing

measurement cell group, which a UE belongs to in primary cell, is shared with the

secondary cells. This groupId is used in the secondary cell

when collecting PRB use distribution information. Therefore, it is recommended that

cells related to carrier aggregation have the same UE slicing measurement cell group

configuration.

A cell slicing measurement cell group and a UE slicing measurement cell group can

coexist in the system. Figure 4 illustrates

an example where a cell slicing measurement cell group and a UE slicing measurement

cell group are configured at the same time.

Figure 4   Coexistence of Cell Slicing Measurement Cell Group and UE Slicing Measurement

Cell Group

The MeasCellGroup.groupId attribute is used as a numeric

identifier of each measurement cell group in the system. Therefore, the

MeasCellGroup.groupId attribute must be unique among

MeasCellGroup MO instances. The bin step size of each

measurement cell group that is used to calculate PRB use distribution information

can be differently configured using the

MeasCellGroup.groupPrbUnit attribute.

The change of measurement cell group configuration takes effect immediately. Counters

collected by only the changed measurement cell group configuration can be obtained

from the next ROP.

Downlink PRB Use Distribution Collection

The MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr counter collects

downlink PRB use distribution information of each measurement cell group. Downlink

PRB use distribution is calculated by the following steps:

1. In every TTI, accumulate PRB use for each measurement cell group by aggregating the number of allocated PRBs in all cells, or all UEs belonging to each measurement cell group.
2. In every 10 TTI, follow these steps for all measurement cell groups:
    1. Calculate average PRB use for each TTI based on the total PRB use accumulated in Step 1.
    2. Calculate the bin index for the MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr counter based on the calculated average PRB use and bin step size.
        - If average PRB use is smaller than or equal to the bin step size, then bin index is equal to zero.
        - If average PRB use is greater than (bin step size * 29), then bin index is equal to 29.
        - Otherwise, bin index is equal to ((average PRB use - 1) / bin step size).
    3. Increase the calculated bin index for the MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr counter by 1.

Figure 5 illustrates an example about how to

calculate the MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr counter

based on the

cell slicing

measurement cell group configuration illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 5   MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr Calculation

for Cell Slicing Measurement Cell Group

Figure 6 illustrates an example of how to

calculate the MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr counter

based on the PLMN UE slicing measurement cell group configuration illustrated in

Figure 2.

Figure 6   MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr Calculation

for UE Slicing Measurement Cell Group

The bin step size of each measurement cell group at the end of each ROP is also

reported using the MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupPrbUnit counter

to help interpret the MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr

counter. The MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr counter

is separately collected in Baseband. If a measurement cell group consists of cells

located in two different Baseband units, the total sum of

MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupDlPrbUsedDistr is twice as much

as for a measurement cell group having cells located in only one Baseband.

Downlink and Uplink UE Throughput Distribution Collection

The MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupUeThp2DlDistr and

MeasCellGroup.pmMeasCellGroupUeThp2UlDistr counters collect

downlink and uplink UE throughput distributions in a group of cells differentiated

by PLMN or SPID.
