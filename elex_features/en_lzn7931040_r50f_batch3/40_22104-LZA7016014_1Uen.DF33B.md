Summary

The Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage feature improves the

functionality

of the Session Continuity

feature

to increase mobility handling flexibility at poor coverage.

The feature introduces a search zone along the edge of the cell, where UE

measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells. If a frequency or cell is

detected, a mobility action is initiated. If no alternative frequencies are detected

in the search zone and the UE moves into critical coverage, a configured emergency

mobility action is selected by the eNodeB and initiated in the UE.

For a UE that encounters poor coverage, the feature makes it possible to search for

several inter-frequency and IRAT target frequencies.

The feature allows the operator to define and prioritize the preferred frequencies

for measurements and mobility actions. It is also possible to disable measurements

per RAT but still be able to perform blind handover or release with redirect to the

RAT at the critical threshold.

This feature also enables ANR to add inter-frequency, GERAN, and UTRAN neighbors

based on mobility triggers in the search zone, instead of triggering on the

dedicated ANR measurements used in the rest of the cell. This results in ANR being

able to define neighbor cells that can be used when a UE reaches the critical

threshold and provides a solution where the best cell is identified and used. Removing the ANR-initiated measurements in the search zone and replacing them with the measurements enhances mobility. Only the cells that are used

for mobility purposes are added. This reduces the neighbor lists to only include

cells that are used.

- At least one of the following features must be activated: Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity TDD only: Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity
- To configure redirection of the UE at poor coverage, information about other carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during network configuration according to the Coverage-Triggered features.
- The settings must be adjusted for the A2 measurement and A1 measurements that detect when the UE has good coverage or is in the search zone so that A2 and A1 measurements are reported from the UE when required.
- When a UE enters the search zone, the eNodeB can configure A3, A5, and B2 measurements in the UE to search for alternative frequencies. This is controlled per RAT by the following parameters: UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveNR UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveCDMA2000 Note: These parameters replace the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive parameter which is used in the Session Continuity features. The A3 measurement that is optionally configured in the search zone is always inter-frequency, as introduced by the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature. It is on a different LTE frequency. The A3 measurement used in the Intra-LTE Handover feature is intra-frequency and is not at all affected by this feature. In this document, A3 measurement only refers to inter-frequency measurements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

The feature Mobility Control at Poor Coverage introduces a search and critical zone along

the edge of the cell. UE measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells.

The Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity features provide a basic process followed by

the eNodeB to determine where to transfer a UE in poor coverage. Each RAT has a

Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature. The following features are the

Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity features:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity

This process is enhanced by the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature, and is

described in this section.

Operational Process

Figure 2   UE Transfer at Poor Coverage Using a Search Zone (Part 2)

The following list provides a detailed description of the workflow in Figure 1.

## 3.1 Process Steps

Steps

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB determines a set of LTE or IRAT frequencies where the UE can be transferred to when it encounters poor coverage in the current cell. The eNodeB finds the frequency relations with the following MO instances: GUtranFreqRelation EUtranFreqRelation GeranFreqGroupRelation UtranFreqRelation Cdma2000FreqBandRelation UtranTDDFreqRelation The corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is active and enabled. According to the capabilities of the UE, as reported to the eNodeB in the UE-EUTRA-Capability IE, the UE is able to operate on the frequency band. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, more frequencies can be supported by the UE. The corresponding RAT is not forbidden according to the HRL of the UE (Forbidden Inter-RATs). See the Shared LTE RAN feature for more information about the HRL criteria. If the allowedPlmnList attribute of the frequency relation MO is non-empty, then at least one of the PLMNs in this attribute matches one of the PLMNs in the HRL of the UE (Serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs).
3. If at least one of the frequencies determined in Step 2has either the connectedModeMobilityPrio or the voicePrio attribute set to a value different than −1, the UE is configured to send a measurement report for A2 measurement, when coverage provided by the serving cell drops below the threshold for entering the search zone. Two A2 measurements can be configured in the UE: one that uses RSRP and one that uses RSRQ as triggering quantity. The InhibitA2SearchConfig attribute controls whether one or both of these are configured. For more details, see Search Zone for UEs in Poor Coverage.
4. One of the A2 measurements, either RSRP or RSRQ, is triggered in the UE and a measurement report is sent to the eNodeB from the UE indicating that the UE enters the search zone for this triggering quantity. Note: While the UE is in the search zone, it is not selected by the Automated Neighbor Relations feature to perform any PCI measurements for GERAN or UTRAN based on UE inactivity. ANR-triggered PCI measurements for LTE frequencies are configured when the UE attaches to the cell and are not affected by the UE entering the search zone.
5. If set to a value different than the default value of 0, the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer timer is started or restarted.
6. The eNodeB stops the A2 measurement that triggered entering into the search zone, as described in Step 4 and Step 7. The eNodeB starts the measurements that must be active in the search zone. This is done differently depending on if the eNodeB is configured for an outer search zone for the triggering quantity and UE. For more information, see The Outer Search Threshold. If the eNodeB is configured for an outer search zone and the reported A2 measurement indicates that the UE is in the inner or outer search zone, the following conditions are checked: The eNodeB is not configured for an outer search zone To detect if the UE moves back into a good coverage zone, the eNodeB starts the A1 measurement that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) as the reported A2 measurement. To determine when the UE moves into a critical poor coverage zone, the eNodeB starts the A2 measurement that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) as the reported A2 measurement. To detect the candidate frequencies selected in Step 2, the eNodeB starts one of the following measurements that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) that triggers the reported A2 measurements: A5 measurement A3 measurement for LTE frequencies B2 measurement for IRAT frequencies A frequency can be measured if the following criteria are met: The UE supports measurements on the frequency. The eNodeB supports measurements on the frequency in the following cases: The eNodeB supports measurements on NR frequencies if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveNR MO attribute is set to true. The eNodeB supports measurements on LTE frequencies if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF MO attribute is set to true. The eNodeB supports measurements on GERAN frequency groups if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN MO attribute is set to true. The eNodeB supports measurements on WCDMA or TD-SCDMA frequencies if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN MO attribute is set to true and there are existing UtranCellRelation MO instances that correspond to the configured cells for the frequency. The eNodeB supports measurements on CDMA-eHRPD frequencies if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveCDMA2000 MO attribute is set to true, and there are existing Cdma2000CellRelation MO instances that correspond to the configured cells for the frequency. The priority of the frequency states if it can be measured. A priority value of −1 means that the frequency is not measured. If the UE has an active voice bearer with QCI1, the attribute voicePrio is used to determine the priority. In this case, frequency relation MOs that do not have this attribute are not measured. If the UE does not have an active voice bearer with QCI1, the attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio is used. If the value of the UeMeasControl.inhibitB2RsrqConfig attribute is set to true, the eNodeB does not configure RSRQ for B2 measurement. For more information, see Table 5. If more frequencies can be measured than configured in the UE, some of the frequencies with the lowest priority are omitted according to the priority attributes voicePrio or connectedModeMobilityPrio. This depends on whether the UE has an active voice bearer with QCI1. The eNodeB is configured for an outer search zone and the received A2 measurement is for the inner search zone. To determine when the UE moves into the outer search zone, the eNodeB starts the A2 measurement that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) as the reported A2 measurement. To detect if the UE moves back into a good coverage zone, the eNodeB starts the A1 measurement that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) as the reported A2 measurement. For more information, see The Outer Search Threshold. To detect the candidate frequencies with high priority, selected in Step 2, the eNodeB starts one of the following measurements that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) that triggers the reported A2 measurements: A5 measurement A3 measurement for LTE frequencies B2 measurement for IRAT frequencies The frequencies are selected in the same way as when the eNodeB is not configured for an outer search zone, with the added restriction that only high priority frequencies are included. These are the frequency relations where the priority attribute has a value equal to or higher than the value of the UeMeasControl.lowPrioMeasThresh attribute. The eNodeB is configured for an outer search zone and the received A2 measurement is for the outer search zone. To determine when the UE moves into a critical poor coverage zone, the eNodeB starts the A2 measurement that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) as the reported A2 measurement. To detect the candidate frequencies with low priority, selected in Step 2, the eNodeB starts one of the following measurements that uses the same trigger quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) that triggers the reported A2 measurements: A5 measurement A3 measurement for LTE frequencies B2 measurement for IRAT frequencies The frequencies are selected in the same way as when the eNodeB is not configured for an outer search zone, with the added restriction that only low-priority frequencies are included. These are the frequency relations where the priority attribute has a value lower than the value of the UeMeasControl.lowPrioMeasThresh attribute. Measurements for the high-priority frequencies are already configured in the inner search zone. If the Automated Neighbor Relations feature is active, it uses measurement reports to detect unknown cells. For more information, see Step 13. It is not possible to detect unknown cells with B2 measurements, which detect known cells only. To find unknown UTRAN cells in the search zone, the Automated Neighbor Relations feature sometimes configures a periodic measurement with information element purpose = reportStrongestCellsForSON on the same frequency as a B2 measurement. The ANR measurement is configured in the UE only if it is not already configured yet by an A2 measurement triggered by RSRP or RSRQ. If the UeMeasControl.inhibitB2RsrqConfig attribute is set to true, the ANR UTRAN measurements with purpose = reportStrongestCellsForSON are also inhibited, when UE is in the RSRQ search zone. Note: The eNodeB does not start new A1 measurements to detect if the UE moves back to the inner search zone from the outer search zone.
7. The UE sends an A2 measurement report. The measurement report can be triggered for the following reasons: The UE is in the search zone for one of the trigger quantities (either RSRQ or RSRP) and the UE entered the search zone for the other quantity as well. The eNodeB is configured for an inner or outer search zone for the reported trigger quantity, for which the UE is already in the inner search zone, and now the UE has entered the outer search zone for the same quantity. For more information, see The Outer Search Threshold.
8. If a bearer with QCI1 is set up while the UE is in the search zone for RSRP or RSRQ or both: The UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is restarted. If the UE is in the search zone for RSRP, all measurements using RSRP are removed from the UE and replaced by new measurements for frequencies based on voicePrio. The same measurements are configured as if the UE entered the search zone (that is, if the A2 search RSRP or A2 Outer Search RSRP is triggered in the UE) with a bearer with QCI=1 already up, see step Step 6. If the UE is in the search zone for RSRQ, all measurements using RSRQ are removed from the UE and replaced by new measurements for frequencies based on voicePrio. The same measurements are configured as if the UE entered the search zone (that is, if the A2 search RSRQ or A2 Outer Search RSRQ is triggered in the UE) with a bearer with QCI=1 already up, see Step 6. If the ENodeBFunction.voiceHoToNrEnabled attribute is set to true, all B2 measurements on NR frequencies are removed from the UE and replaced by new B2 measurements for NR frequencies based on voicePrio. If the ENodeBFunction.voiceHoToNrEnabled attribute is set to false, no new B2 measurements are configured as long as the QCI1 bearer is established. Note: Which measurements to be set up depend on whether the eNodeB has been configured for an outer search zone or not, and whether the UE is in the inner or outer search zone for the triggering quantities (RSRP and RSRQ). For more information, see The Outer Search Threshold.
9. If a bearer with QCI1 is released while the UE is in the search zone for RSRP or RSRQ or both, the following is applicable: The UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is restarted. If the UE is in the search zone for RSRP, all measurements using RSRP are removed from the UE and replaced by new measurements for frequencies based on connectedModeMobilityPrio. The same measurements are configured as if the UE entered the search zone (that is, if the A2 search RSRP or A2 Outer Search RSRP is triggered in the UE) without any bearer with QCI=1 already setup, see Step 6. If the UE is in the search zone for RSRQ, all measurements using RSRQ are removed from the UE and replaced by new measurements for frequencies based on connectedModeMobilityPrio. The same measurements are configured as if the UE entered the search zone (that is, if the A2 search RSRQ or A2 Outer Search RSRQ is triggered in the UE) without a bearer with QCI=1 already setup, see Step 6. Note: Which measurements to be set up depend on whether the eNodeB has been configured for an outer search zone or not, and whether the UE is in the inner or outer search zone for the triggering quantities (RSRP and RSRQ). For more information, see The Outer Search Threshold.
10. The UE sends an A1 measurement report after the UE leaves the search zone for the reported triggering quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) and enters good coverage again. The following cases are applicable: If the UE is in the search zone only because of RSRP, A1 measurement RSRP is configured for the UE. If the UE reports A1 measurement RSRP, it means that the UE is now in good coverage for both RSRP and RSRQ. If the UE is in the search zone only because of RSRQ, A1 measurement RSRQ is configured for the UE. If the UE reports A1 measurement RSRQ, it means that the UE is now in good coverage for both RSRP and RSRQ. If the UE is in the search zone because of both RSRP and RSRQ, an RSRP A1 measurement and an RSRQ A1 measurement are configured for the UE. If the UE reports an RSRP A1 measurement or an RSRQ A1 measurement, the UE is still in the search zone for the other triggering quantity. In all cases, the following measurements, which are based on the triggered quantity, RSRP or RSRQ, are removed from the UE: A1 measurement A2 measurement A2 measurement A3 measurement or A5 measurement B2 measurement The removed measurements are replaced by the corresponding A2 measurement. If the UE is in good coverage for both triggering quantities, the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer timer is canceled and the eNodeB waits for A2 measurement reports. ANR can now configure PCI measurements in the UE again.
11. The timer started in Step 5, UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer, expires. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI1, which indicates a voice bearer, the eNodeB stops all A5, A3, and B2 measurements started in Step 6. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI1, the eNodeB restarts the timer.
12. An A5, A3, and B2 measurement report arrives from the UE for one of the frequencies.
13. If the best cell of the measurement report is unknown in the source cell, the eNodeB sometimes informs the Automated Neighbor Relations feature about the cell and takes no further action, even if there are other known cells in the same measurement report. This provides ANR with an option to request the UE to report the unique CGI of the potential neighbor cell before the next A5, A3, and B2 measurement report arrives from the UE. This occurs if the following criteria are met: ANR is OPERABLE, and must be activated for the specific RAT of the measurement report. See the AnrFunctionEUtran.anrInterFreqState and AnrFunctionGeran.anrStateGsm MO attributes. B2 measurement reports cannot include an unknown cell. See Automated Neighbor Relations for information on how to discover unknown UTRAN cells in the search zone. The best cell of the measurement report is unknown in the source cell, that is, there is no cell relation to the reported cell from the source cell. No voice call is ongoing in the UE. That is, the UE has no bearer with QCI1. The UE is able to do CGI measurements for the reported cell. For E-UTRAN cells, this is indicated by FGI bits bit 5, 18 and 25, and for GERAN cells by FGI bits 5 and 19. Either no earlier measurement report for the A5, A3, and the B2 measurements is received, or the A3 measurement report has been ignored to enable an ANR CGI measurement. That is, for a UE, at the most one measurement report is ignored to allow for an ANR CGI measurement while the UE is in the search zone.
14. The eNodeB checks if a handover is allowed and possible to one of the reported cells, starting with the strongest one. A cell is a viable handover target if all the following criteria are fulfilled: The value of the mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER on the relevant frequency relation MO. The relevant handover feature is set to OPERABLE: Outgoing NR IRAT Handover Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover SRVCC Handover to UTRAN SRVCC Handover to GERAN The UE supports handover to the relevant RAT. If the frequency supports a different mode, for example TDD for FDD, the Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover feature must be set to OPERABLE and the UE must support inter-mode handover. The cell is defined in the MOM. There is a cell relation to the cell from the serving cell in the MOM. The isHoAllowed attribute is set to true on the cell relation MO. The cell has a tracking area or location area which is not forbidden according to the HRL of the UE. The Cell Soft Lock feature has not temporarily set the cell as a non-viable target. For measurement reports on A3, A5, B1, and B2 measurements, the eNodeB can be configured to perform an extended check before handover. The check evaluates the non-triggering quantity received in the measurement report. Handover is triggered only if the measured non-triggering quantity fulfills the configured conditions. The description of checks performed for each of the events (where the expressions are calculated based on MOM configuration values) are as follows: A5 measurement As a prerequisite, the bothA5RsrpRsrqCheck MO attribute must be set to true for the extended "Good enough target cell on other LTE frequency" check. The measured non-triggered quantity value must be higher than the following expression: Where: X Stands for RSRP or RSRQ. cellIndivOffsetn Stands for the cell individual offset value of the neighbor cell. qOffsetFreqn Stands for the frequency-based offset of the neighbor cell. A3 measurement Intra-frequency handover As a prerequisite, the bothIntraA3RsrpRsrqCheck MO attribute must be set to true for the extended "Good enough target cell on the same LTE frequency" check. The measured non-triggering quantity offset value must be higher than the following expression: Where: X Stands for RSRP or RSRQ. cellIndivOffsetn Stands for the cell individual offset value of the neighbor cell. Inter-frequency handover As a prerequisite, the bothInterA3RsrpRsrqCheck MO attribute must be set to true for the extended "Good enough target cell on other LTE frequency" check. The measured non-triggering quantity offset value must be higher than the following expression: Where: X Stands for RSRP or RSRQ. cellIndivOffsetn Stands for the cell individual offset value of the neighbor cell. qOffsetFreqs Stands for the frequency-based offset of the serving cell. qOffsetFreqn Stands for the frequency-based offset of the neighbor cell. B1 measurement and B2 measurement CSFB handover As a prerequisite, either the UeMeasControl.bothB1RscpEcnoCheck or the UeMeasControl.bothB2RscpEcnoCheck MO attribute must be set to true. The measured non-triggering quantity offset value must be higher than the following expression: Where: X Stands for RSCP or ECNO. CsfbThreshold2X Stands for the base configured threshold value. qOffsetFreqn Stands for the frequency-based offset of the neighbor cell. UTRAN handover As a prerequisite, the UeMeasControl.bothB2RscpEcnoCheck MO attribute must be set to true for the extended "Good enough target cell IRAT" check. The measured non-triggering quantity offset value must be higher than the following expression: B2Threshold2XUtra1 - qOffsetFreqn + hysteresisB2 Where: X Stands for RSCP or ECNO. qOffsetFreqn Stands for the frequency-based offset of the neighbor cell. Note: If the UeMeasControl.bothB2RscpEcnoCheck MO attribute is enabled, EUtranFreqRelation.qOffsetFreq exceeding ±1 dB has a significant impact on behavior.

19. If the EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed attribute is set to false, release with redirect is not allowed. The eNodeB takes no further action in this case. This means that the UE remains in the cell and waits for another measurement report. If the EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed attribute is set to true, the next check is performed.
20. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI1 indicating a voice bearer, a release of the UE is not allowed, and the eNodeB takes no further action. That is, the UE remains in the cell and waits for another measurement report. This behavior can be changed by setting the allowReleaseQci1 attribute to true. However, for UE release actions towards targets other than NR frequencies, the allowReleaseQci1 attribute takes effect only when the SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature and the SRVCC Handover to GERAN feature are not set to OPERABLE. If the UE release action targets an NR frequency, the allowReleaseQci1 attribute is always in effect. If the eNodeB performs a release with redirect, the default behavior in a Core Network is to remove the voice connection. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI1, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to the frequency of the measurement report.
21. An A2 measurement report arrives from the UE.
22. A prioritized list of possible target frequencies is determined by performing the following: The list of frequencies found in Step 2 is used. If the UeMeasControl.excludeInterFreqAtCritical attribute is set to true, all E-UTRAN frequencies are removed. The priority to use is decided based on the following criteria: If the UE has an active bearer with QCI1, the voicePrio attribute is used on the frequency relation MOs. Frequency relations where the voicePrio attribute is not configured are considered to have a priority of −1. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI1, the connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute is used. The list is ordered according to the selected priority, and all frequencies with a priority of −1 are removed. If a frequency is measured in the search zone for longer than the time indicated by the searchEffortTime attribute, it is considered to be a non-feasible target, since no measurement report was triggered in the UE. Exclude all such frequencies from the list, unless this action leaves the list empty, in which case the list is left unmodified by this step. The special value 0 of the searchEffortTime attribute means that the list is always unmodified by this step.
23. The eNodeB checks if a blind handover is possible to a cell on one of the frequencies with the highest priority in the list from Step 18. A cell is a viable blind handover target if all the following criteria are fulfilled: The value of the mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER on the relevant frequency relation MO. The relevant handover feature is set to OPERABLE: Outgoing NR IRAT Handover Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA IRAT Handover SRVCC Handover to UTRAN SRVCC Handover to GERAN The UE supports handover to the relevant RAT. If the frequency supports a different mode, for example TDD for FDD, the Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover feature must be set to OPERABLE and the UE must support inter-mode handover. The cell is defined in the MOM. There is a cell relation to the cell from the serving cell in the MOM The isHoAllowed attribute is set to true on the cell relation MO. The coverageIndicator attribute is set to COVERS on the cell relation MO. The covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute is set to true on the serving cell. The cell has a tracking area or location area which is not forbidden according to the HRL of the UE. The Cell Soft Lock feature has not temporarily set the cell as a non-viable target.
24. If the EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed attribute is set to false, release with redirect is not allowed. The eNodeB takes no further action in this case. This means that the UE remains in the cell and waits for one of the following measurement reports: Target Good Enough Good Coverage Critical Coverage Search Zone If the EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed attribute is set to true, the next check is performed.
25. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI1 indicating a voice bearer, the release of the UE is not allowed and the eNodeB takes no further action. This means that the UE remains in the cell and waits for one of the following measurement reports: Target Good Enough Good Coverage Critical Coverage Search Zone This behavior can be changed by setting the allowReleaseQci1 attribute to true. However, for UE release actions towards targets other than NR frequencies, the allowReleaseQci1 attribute takes effect only when the SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature and the SRVCC Handover to GERAN feature are not set to OPERABLE. If the UE release action targets an NR frequency, the allowReleaseQci1 attribute is always in effect. If the eNodeB performs a release with redirect, the default behavior in the Core Network is to remove the voice connection. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI1, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to the frequency with the highest priority in the list determined in Step 18.

## 3.2 Search Zone for UEs in Poor Coverage

A search zone in a cell is a zone in the cell following the cell edge, where UEs approaching

poor coverage in the serving cell start to search for alternative frequencies where the UE can

be transferred.

The search zone is detected by A2 measurement or A5 measurements.

Figure 3   Cell Search and Critical Zone Defined by Search and Critical Thresholds

The search zone can be split into an inner and an outer search zone. In the inner search zone

the UE only searches for frequencies with high priority.

Figure 4   Cell Search Zone Defined by Inner and Outer Search Thresholds

### 3.2.1 The Search Threshold

To detect that the UE has entered the (inner) search zone, A2 measurements are configured in

the UE when it attaches to the cell. Depending on the value of the

ReportConfigSearch.inhibitA2SearchConfig attribute, one or two

measurements are configured, using RSRP or RSRQ or one of each as triggering quantities. When

an A2 measurement triggers, the UE is considered to be in the search zone for the reported

triggering quantity. To detect when the UE leaves the search zone and enters into good

coverage again, corresponding A1 measurements are configured in the UE.

The report configuration for both the A1 and A2 measurements are based on parameters in the

UeMeasControl.ReportConfigSearch MO.

These measurements replace the Poor Coverage measurements introduced

by the Session Continuity features.

The report configurations for these measurements are also affected by the Service Triggered Mobility and Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility features.

### 3.2.2 The Outer Search Threshold

It is possible to configure the eNodeB such that the search zone is divided into an inner and an outer search zone. This is done

separately for RSRP and RSRQ by setting the

ReportConfigSearch.a2OuterSearchThrRsrpOffset and

ReportConfigSearch.a2OuterSearchThrRsrqOffset attributes to a value lower

than 0. If an outer search zone is defined, the UE is configured with an A2 measurement when

it enters the inner search zone, as detected by the A2 measurement, see Step 6 in Process Steps.

### 3.2.3 The Critical Threshold

To detect that the UE has encountered critical coverage, the A2 measurements are configured

in the UE when it enters the search zone. See Step 6 in Process Steps and

Step 10 in Process Steps for more details on when these are

configured in the UE. The report configuration for these are all based on parameters in the

ReportConfigSearch MO, see Table 3.

These measurements replace the Poor Coverage measurements introduced by the Session

Continuity features.

The report configurations for these measurements are not affected by the Service Triggered Mobility or Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility features, but they are

affected by the ReportConfigSearch.a2CriticalThrQci1RsrpOffset and

ReportConfigSearch.a2CriticalThrQci1RsrqOffset attributes, which can move

the critical threshold when the UE has a bearer with QCI1.

When the High Power UE and the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility features are active,

this threshold can change if a higher power class is used, which extends the cell

coverage.

## 3.3 Level Based Search Zone Transitions

When the UE enters the search zone and a measurement report is received in Step 6 in Process Steps, the eNodeB configures a new measurement to detect when the UE

reaches the critical threshold or the outer search zone. However, the received measurement

report contains the measured RSRP or RSRQ value, and if the quantity has dropped quickly for

the UE, it can already fulfill the threshold for critical coverage or outer search zone.

In this case, the default behavior of the eNodeB is to take the appropriate action without

first configuring the measurement for which it knows that the thresholds are already

fulfilled, as described below. If this behavior is not desired, it is possible to disable it

by setting the MOM attribute UeMeasControl.checkA2SearchLevel to

FALSE, which makes the eNodeB ignore the reported values for RSRP and

RSRQ.

### 3.3.1 Using One Search Zone

If the received search zone measurement report is using RSRP and it contains a measured value

which fulfills the critical RSRP threshold, or it is using RSRQ and it contains a

measured value which fulfills the critical RSRQ threshold, the eNodeB skips directly to Step 16 in Process Steps, without first configuring an A2 Critical measurement, or any

A5/A3/B2 measurements in the UE. The following cases apply:

- A cell suitable for blind handover exists. I this case a handover to this cell is initiated.
- The UE does not have a bearer with QCI=1 (and no cell suitable for blind handover exists). In this case a release with redirect is initiated.
- The UE has a bearer with QCI=1 (and no cell suitable for blind handover exists). When entering into critical coverage from the search zone this would mean that nothing happens and the UE remains in the cell with the same set of A5/A3/B2 measurements, and A2 critical measurement. But in this case, these measurements have not been configured in the UE since it entered critical coverage directly from good coverage. This case does not get any special handling and all measurements is configured in the UE as in Step 6 in Process Steps and onwards.

### 3.3.2 Using an Inner Search Zone and an Outer Search Zone

The following cases are possible:

- The UE goes directly from Good Coverage to the Outer Search Zone. That is, the received search zone measurement report is using RSRP and it contains a measured value which fulfills the outer search zone RSRP threshold, or it is using RSRQ and it contains a measured value which fulfills the outer search zone RSRQ threshold. In this case, A5, A3, and B2 measurements for both high and low priority frequencies are configured in the UE, which effectively makes this similar to how a UE is configured in the search zone when there is only one single search zone (no inner/outer split). Measurements for A1 measurement and A2 measurement are also configured. See Step 6 in Process Steps for more details.
- The UE goes directly from Good Coverage to Critical Coverage. That is, the received search zone measurement report is using RSRP and it contains a measured value which fulfills the critical RSRP threshold, or it is using RSRQ and it contains a measured value which fulfills the critical RSRQ threshold. This case is handled in the exact same way as when the UE goes from good coverage to critical coverage when just a single search zone is configured.
- The UE goes directly from the Inner Search Zone to Critical Coverage. That is, the received outer search zone measurement report is using RSRP and it contains a measured value which fulfills the critical RSRP threshold. Or, it is using RSRQ and it contains a measured value which fulfills the critical RSRQ threshold. This case is handled in almost the same way as when the UE goes from good coverage to critical coverage when just a single search zone is configured. The end result is the same, but the major difference is that since the UE has previously entered the inner search zone, the UE is already configured with A5, A3, B2 measurements for high priority frequencies. Only A5, A3, B2 measurements for low priority frequencies are configured in the UE in this case. A1 measurement is already configured in the UE, but A2 measurement is removed from the UE.

# 4 Network Impact of Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

Capacity and Performance

The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature ensures that network capacity is

enhanced by improving the way the UE is served by providing the best available

frequency in the network.

It is possible to configure this feature in such a way that an off-loading effect is

achieved, where UEs are transferred from the LTE frequency to another LTE or IRAT

frequency. This can be used to avoid overload and improve the overall network

capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature has no impact on the physical cell coverage. However, off-loading UEs to

alternative frequencies indirectly means that coverage is improved.

The UE is running on the operator preferred frequency more often. Measurement gap is

more frequently used.

# 5 Parameters

## 5.1 Feature Configuration Parameters

Table 2 describes the attributes introduced by

the feature which are related to detecting search thresholds. They are used for the

measurement report configurations of the two A2 measurements: One using RSRP and one RSRQ and

the two A1 measurements, one using RSRP and one RSRQ.

Table 3 describes the attributes introduced by

the feature that are related to detecting critical thresholds. These attributes are used for

the measurement report configuration of A2 measurements.

If the values of the attributes in Table 2 and

Table 3 are changed, UEs might move into the

search zone or critical coverage. This increases the number of handovers and release with

redirect procedures. These release with redirect procedures might lead to packet loss.

Attribute ENodeBFunction.zzztemporary55 is used to enable machine learning

to find best frequencies.

## 5.2 Affected Parameters

The implementation of this feature affects no parameters.

## 5.3 Parameters Affecting the Feature

When this feature is enabled, the parameters of the Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity

feature still apply, especially the A3 and A5 tables of the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency

Session Continuity feature, and the B2 tables of the following features:

- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity

The following exceptions apply:

- The configuration parameters for A1 measurement and A2 measurement no longer apply. See the A1 and A2 tables of the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity feature, since these measurements are replaced in this feature. However, the following parameters still apply: UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrp UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrq UeMeasControl.sMeasure
- The UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive parameter is not used, and is replaced by the following new parameters: UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveNR UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveCDMA2000
- The triggerQuantityA3, triggerQuantityA5, and triggerQuantityB2 parameters are not used. Instead, the source and target cell-related trigger quantity in the A3 measurements and A5 measurements and the source cell-related trigger quantity in the B2 measurements configured in the search zone is set according to the quantity (RSRP or RSRQ) that triggered the A2 measurement report.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

The mobCtrlAtPoorCovActive attribute must be set to

TRUE for each cell where the feature must be active.

To make the feature work best, the following must be considered:

- The search threshold must be tuned.
- The critical threshold must be tuned.
- The measurements for finding alternative frequencies, such as the A5 measurement and the A3 measurement for LTE frequencies, and the B2 measurement for other RATs.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q1: Improved Quantity Check for Handover Decision

The

feature enhancement allows different handover decisions to be made depending on what

measurement report the eNodeB receives.

| Feature Name:           | Mobility Control at Poor Coverage   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3013                        |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                 |

The feature enhancement allows making handover decisions based on quantities between RSRP

and RSRQ, or RSCP and EcN0. When the eNodeB receives an A3 measurement report, it makes

the decision based on RSRP or RSRQ. When it receives a B1 or B2 measurement report, it

makes the decision based on RSCP and EcN0 instead. The feature enhancement also allows

for the requesting of the second quantity in report configuration for B1 (only for CSFB)

and B2 measurements.

For A3 intra- and inter-frequency measurements, either RSRP or RSRQ can be checked as

second quantity.

Non-triggering quantity evaluation can be enabled separately for each measurement

type.

Capacity and Performance

The ratio of the number of successful handovers and the total number of handover

attempts are increased for the following:

- Mobility Success Rate
- Handover Success Rate
- Cell Handover Success Rate
- Handover Execution Success Rate
- Cell Handover Execution Success Rate
- UTRAN Handover Success Rate
- UTRAN SRVCC Handover Success Rate

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following new MO attributes:

- ReportConfigB1Utra.reportQuantityB1Utra
- ReportConfigB2Utra.reportQuantityB2Utra
- UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientRscpUtra
- UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEcnoUtra
- UeMeasControl.bothB1RscpEcnoCheck
- UeMeasControl.bothB2RscpEcnoCheck
- UeMeasControl.bothInterA3RsrpRsrqCheck
- UeMeasControl.bothIntraA3RsrpRsrqCheck

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

This enhancement requires ENM version 18.17 or later to be used.

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q1: Availability Setting for Release with Redirect in Search and Critical Zone

The

feature enhancement allows the disabling of RwR in search and critical zone for Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage.

| Feature Name:           | Mobility Control at Poor Coverage   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3013                        |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                 |

The feature enhancement introduces configuration for eNodeB, which allows the enabling or

disabling of RwR when mobility action is set to HANDOVER.

Capacity and Performance

If retransmitting at higher power, there can be an impact on "E-RAB Retainability".

During this case, any of the following can be observed:

- Increase in interference
- Increase in network traffic
- Increase in the packet loss rate

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following new counters:

- pmErabRelAbnormalMmeActCritCov
- pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbCritCov
- pmErabRelAbnormalEnbCritCov
- pmErabRelAbnormalEnbActCritCov
- pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbActCritCov
- pmErabRelAbnormalMmeCritCov
- pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalMmeCritCov
- pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalMmeActCritCov
- pmCovCriticalZoneSum
- pmCovCriticalZoneSamp

The feature enhancement introduces the following new configuration parameters:

- EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed

Interfaces

## Appendix A.c: 21.Q3: Configurable Release with Redirect at Critical Zone

With this feature enhancement, RwR can be enabled or disabled in a critical zone.

| Feature Name:           | Mobility Control at Poor Coverage   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3013                        |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                 |

Benefits

With this feature enhancement, RwR can be enabled in a critical zone when the value

of the EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER.

Capacity and Performance

If RwR is not triggered at critical coverage, the UE remains in the cell. This

increases the risk of call drops.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q4: NR Mobility Enhancement for Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

This feature enhancement improves mobility handling when searching for NR frequencies

at poor LTE coverage.

| Feature Name           | Mobility Control at Poor Coverage   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 3013                        |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                    |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400                        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type            | LTE                                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables NR standalone frequencies and cells to be handover

candidates in the inner and outer search zone, and in the critical zone. Handovers

to NR standalone frequencies and cells are enabled through reusing the B2 NR

measurement framework introduced by the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature.

The introduction of the search zones and the critical zone for handovers to NR

improves the chance of successful mobility actions to an NR frequency if poor LTE

coverage is detected through UE measurements.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement uses the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveNR attribute to control B2

measurements on NR frequencies for mobility purposes.

The feature enhancement modifies the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 23.4 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.
