# 1 VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation Overview

The feature provides functions to improve VoLTE retainability when the UE is more

likely to lose VoLTE connection while it uses carrier aggregation.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature improves VoLTE retainability through the following methods:

- Deconfiguring uplink and downlink SCells and measurements related to carrier aggregation, and SCells during VoLTE calls
- Suppressing SCell configuration and deconfiguration together with deconfiguration of uplink carrier aggregation functions while keeping downlink carrier aggregation functions and downlink SCells
- Deconfiguring only uplink SCells and maintaining downlink SCells during VoLTE calls

The feature can also disable carrier aggregation configuration at initial connection

establishment if the establishment cause is mo-voiceCall. This

results in improved voice call setup time and reduced call drop rate.

Additional Information

For more information and related topics, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.300, Overall description, Stage 2
- 3GPP TS 36.331, Radio Resource Control (RRC)
- 3GPP TS 36.413, S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)
- 3GPP TS 36.423, X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation

The Carrier Aggregation and the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation

features are prerequisites of the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

For the Disabling SCell Configuration at Voice Call Setup function to operate, the

following requirements must be fulfilled:

- ENM version 21.2 or later is required.
- UE must support capabilities defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 version 12.12.0 or later, and the mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE introduced in 3GPP TS 36.331 version 12.8.0.

# 3 Feature Operation of VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation

The feature modifies the SCell selection and SCell configurations for UE with voice

bearer.

For the operation of the feature, the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute or the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.serviceType attribute is set to

VOIP or PTT, and the eNodeB receives a voice

bearer request in the following processes:

- E-RAB setup
- Initial Context Setup
- Handover
- RRC Connection Reestablishment

The feature can be also triggered when the voice bearer is released in the E-RAB release

procedure.

Feature Operation

The operation of the feature during VoLTE calls depends on the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute. The

attributes can have one of the following values:

The setup of voice bearer and removal of measurements related to carrier aggregation

and SCells are handled with a single RRCConnectionReconfiguration

message to reduce the number of RRC signaling.

## 3.1 Disabling SCell Configuration at Voice Call Setup

This function extends the time period of the feature.

The UE can indicate the reason of the connection by sending the

mo-VoiceCall establishment cause. If the eNodeB receives the

RRCConnectionRequest message with the

mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE, SCells are not configured according to the

value of the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute in the first

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. This also improves VoLTE

retainability and can possibly lead to reduced voice call setup time.

This function is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteOptimizedCa or the

EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteOptimizedCa attribute to

true.

The function delays the SCell configuration at the initial connection establishment with

the following steps:

1. The UE sends RRCConnectionRequest message with the mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE to the eNodeB.
2. The eNodeB starts the guard timer after receiving Initial Context Setup message for QCI5 and QCI9 from the MME. The timer is defined by the ENodeBFunction.tMoVoiceBearerEstSupervision attribute.
3. The eNodeB does not configure downlink or uplink SCell during initial voice call setup according to the value of the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute.
4. The eNodeB stops the guard timer after receiving ERAB setup request (QCI1) from MME. When the QCI1 bearer is established, the eNodeB still does not start to configure SCells according to the value of the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute until the QCI1 bearer is released. The purpose of the guard timer is to configure SCells when the MME does not send a QCI1 setup request after the default QCI setup. It is recommended to set the guard timer to the default value if the QCI1 setup time is less than 2 s. Otherwise, it is recommended to set to a value greater than the average QCI1 setup time. If the QCI1 setup fails or the guard timer expires, the eNodeB starts to configure SCells according to the value of the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute.

# 4 Network Impact of VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves VoLTE retainability.

Capacity and Performance

The VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature improves the retainability of voice

bearer and the call drop rate during VoLTE calls. Also, it can possibly reduce voice

call setup time.

The process affects the uplink or downlink throughput, or both, depending on the

session time of the voice bearer service.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node
- The prerequisite features are activated in the node
- CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012259 MO instance.

After This Task

Let the CCTR be active for one week, for continued collection of troubleshooting

data.

# 8 Deactivate VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that

troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012259 MO instance.

After This Task

Let the CCTR be active for one week, for continued collection of troubleshooting

data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4884                          |
| Value Package Name:     | VoLTE Performance                     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0444                          |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                   |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                   |

Benefits

The enhancement improves VoLTE retainability and voice call setup time.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This enhancement extends VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation for the initial

establishment of voice call setup because the UE can indicate the reason of the

connection by sending the mo-VoiceCall establishment cause. If

the eNodeB receives the RRC Connection Request message with the

mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE, SCells are not configured according to the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute.

The enhancement must be enabled with the

EUtranCellFDD.enhVolteOptimizedCa or the

EUtranCellTDD.enhVolteOptimizedCa attribute. It also requires

that the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute is not set

to KEEP\_SCELLS.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

- ENM version 21.2 or later is required.
- UE must support capabilities defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 version 12.12.0 or later, and the mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE introduced in 3GPP TS 36.331 version 12.8.0.
