Summary

The following Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk service functions are supported:

- Mission-critical user plane PTT voice (QCI=65)
- Non-mission-critical user plane PTT voice (QCI=66)
- Mission-critical delay-sensitive signaling (QCI=69)
- Mission-critical data (QCI= 70)

The Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature enables support for mission-critical services in the

eNodeB as part of the whole Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk network solution.

This feature adds standardized, predefined mission-critical QCI profiles, without the

requirement of adding them manually. When a bearer is set up using these introduced

QCI profiles, it applies special handling to them similar to VoLTE.

Mission-critical traffic is differentiated from other types of traffic by higher

scheduling priority.

Feature Dependency Between Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk and Operator Defined

QCI

The predefined mission-critical QCI profiles use QCI values that are also available

for operator-defined QCI profiles through the Operator Defined QCI feature. The

usage of these QCI profiles is determined by the feature state of the

Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk and the Operator Defined QCI features:

- If none of the features are active, these QCI profiles are not used.
- If only the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is active, the predefined QCI profiles are used.
- If only the Operator Defined QCI feature is active, and there are operator-defined QCI profiles overlapping with the predefined mission-critical QCIs, the operator-defined QCI profiles are used.
- If both features are active, and there are operator-defined QCI profiles overlapping with the predefined mission-critical QCIs, the predefined QCI profiles are used.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Mobility towards GERAN and UTRAN is limited, for details, see Mobility of Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

The Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is not supported on TDD.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, the following network requirements must be

fulfilled:

- The Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk application server must be used in the core network.
- The UE must be Release 12 or later and support Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk.

# 3 Feature Operation of Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

The feature introduces new predefined QCIs for mission-critical bearers, which are

handled by the network similarly to VoLTE bearers.

With this feature, four new predefined QCI profiles can be used for mission-critical

bearer setup:

- QCI 65 for mission-critical Push-to-Talk
- QCI 66 for non-mission-critical Push-to-Talk
- QCI 69 for mission-critical signaling
- QCI 70 for mission-critical data

The established mission-critical bearers are handled similarly to VoLTE bearers. Two new

service types, PTT and MC\_SIGNALING are used to

identify these mission-critical bearers by the

QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute.

- Service type PTT for QCIs 65 and 66. These bearers are handled similarly to VoLTE voice bearers, identified with QCI 1 or service type VOIP.
- Service type MC\_SIGNALING for QCI 69. These bearers are handled similarly to VoLTE signaling bearers, identified with QCI 5 or service type IMS\_SIGNALING.

For details on how specific features handle VoLTE and mission-critical bearers, see the

corresponding Feature Descriptions.

## 3.1 Mobility of Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

Intra-LTE mobility of UEs with an active mission-critical bearer is similarly handled

to those with an active VoLTE bearer, with a few differences.

Bearers with service type PTT are handled like bearers with the

service type VOIP, and bearers with the service type

MC\_SIGNALING are handled like bearers with the service type

IMS\_SIGNALING. The difference is that for mobility actions,

bearers with the service type MC\_SIGNALING are also considered as a

trigger. This is because Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk is considered active even if

only the signaling bearer is set up, unlike VoLTE.

The following features are adapted to handle intra-LTE mobility of UEs with active

mission-critical bearers like VoLTE UEs:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Intra-LTE Handover
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage
- Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Shared LTE RAN
- Subscriber Triggered Mobility
- Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

Mobility towards GERAN and UTRAN, including session continuity, SRVCC handover, and CS

fallback, is also handled similarly to UEs with VoLTE bearers. However, if there are

restrictions on Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk service in these networks, it can also

prevent mobility towards them in order to keep the UE on the LTE network as long as

possible.

For Release with redirect towards GERAN and UTRAN networks, the same handling is

applied to mission-critical bearers than for VoLTE bearers. It means the same

attribute (UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1) is used for

Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk as for VoLTE to regulate it.

The following features are adapted to handle mobility towards GERAN and UTRAN for UEs

with active mission-critical bearers:

- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover
- CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN
- Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback
- SRVCC Handover to GERAN
- SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

Mobility towards CDMA-based networks is not supported. This means that the following

features do not apply to the new QCIs:

- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity
- CS Fallback to CDMA 1X
- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

# 4 Network Impact of Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

The mission-critical bearers introduced by the feature use the same resources as VoLTE

bearers, but get higher scheduling priority. There is no impact on interfaces or other

network elements.

Capacity and Performance

Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk uses the same network resources as VoLTE. The

mission-critical QCIs have higher priority than VoLTE QCIs, so the mission-critical

bearers get higher priority when scheduling resources for DRBs. The values of the

QCIProfilePredefined.priority and

QCIProfilePredefined.priorityFraction attributes define the

QCI priority. For more information about the QCI priorities, see QoS-Aware Scheduler.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

The feature affects parameters in relation to the introduction of the QCIs.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk

The Service Specific Load Management feature can be used to exclude mission-critical

PTT UEs from load-triggered handovers because handovers have a negative effect on voice

quality.

Subscriber Triggered Mobility and Preferential Traffic

Management can be used to configure load-based handover of UEs based on SPID for

each frequency. Subscriber Triggered Mobility, Preferential Traffic Management and

Service Specific Load Management can be used together to configure optimal operation

for mission-critical PTT UEs.

It is possible to individually configure the load-based handover to another E-UTRAN

frequency for each QCI with the Service Specific Load Management feature. This

allows that load-based handover is allowed for mission-critical PTT users without

active PTT calls, forbidden when a PTT call is active.

The load-based handovers based on QCI can be configured with following

attributes:

| E-UTRAN frequency   |    | The lbQciProfileHandling attribute of                                 EUtranFreqRelation.eutranFreqToQciProfileRelation.   |
|---------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                            |
| UTRAN frequency     |    | The lbQciProfileHandling attribute of                                 UtranFreqRelation.utranFreqToQciProfileRelation.     |

Mobility based on SPID can be used for adjusting the handover of UEs together with

QCI-based mobility. The following attributes are used for configuring mobility based

on SPID:

| E-UTRAN frequency   |    | The loadBalancingAllowed and                                 offloadAllowed  attributes of                                 RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA.   |
|---------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| UTRAN frequency     |    | The loadBalancingAllowed attribute of                                 RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListUTRA.                                                         |

The formula is not changed. The counters are not affected

by PTT traffic anymore.

The following counters are introduced for observing PTT traffic:

- pmDlAssigsTransMcPtt
- pmDlAssigsTransMcPttNDO
- pmDlAssigsDetHarqMcPttNDO
- pmDlAssigsWithDetHarqAckMcPtt
- pmDlAssigsWithUnknownRecMcPtt
- pmUlGrantsTransMcPtt
- pmUlGrantsTransMcPttNDO
- pmUlGrantsTransMcPttNoAck
- pmUlGrantsDetPuschMcPttNDO
- pmUlGrantsWithDetPuschMcPtt
- pmDlAssigsTransNonMcPtt
- pmDlAssigsTransNonMcPttNDO
- pmDlAssigsDetHarqNonMcPttNDO
- pmDlAssigsWithDetHarqAckNonMcPtt
- pmDlAssigsWithUnknownRecNonMcPtt
- pmUlGrantsTransNonMcPtt
- pmUlGrantsTransNonMcPttNDO
- pmUlGrantsTransNonMcPttNoAck
- pmUlGrantsDetPuschNonMcPttNDO
- pmUlGrantsWithDetPuschNonMcPtt

The following counters are stepped if the cell is used as a PCell and do not have

bearers mapped to QCIs with VoIP or PTT service type:

- pmDlAssigsTransPCell
- pmDlAssigsWithDetectedHarqAckPCell
- pmDlAssigsWithUnknownReceptionPCell
- pmUlGrantsTransPCell
- pmUlGrantsTransPCellNoAck
- pmUlGrantsWithDetectedPuschPCell

The following counters are modified to only consider VoLTE traffic when they are

stepped:

- pmDlAssigsTransVolte
- pmDlAssigsTransVolteNDO
- pmDlAssigsDetectedHarqVolteNDO
- pmDlAssigsWithDetectedHarqAckVolte
- pmDlAssigsWithUnknownReceptionVolte
- pmUlGrantsTransVolte
- pmUlGrantsTransVolteNDO
- pmUlGrantsTransVolteNoAck
- pmUlGrantsDetectedPuschVolteNDO
- pmUlGrantsWithDetectedPuschVolte

Both VoLTE and PTT traffic are considered when the following counters are stepped to

allow the filtering of downlink UE PDCP throughput for PTT traffic:

- pmUeExclThpDlVolte
- pmUeExclThpDlVolteMbb

The following events are introduced:

- INTERNAL\_PER\_CELL\_TRAFFIC\_REPORT2
- INTERNAL\_PER\_UETR\_CELL\_TRAFFIC\_REPORT2
- LOCAL\_PER\_BB\_CELL4\_EVENT
- LOCAL\_PER\_BB\_UETR\_CELL4\_EVENT

The following event parameters are added to the introduced events:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_NON\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_NON\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_NON\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_NON\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_UNKNOWN\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_UNKNOWN\_NON\_MC\_PTT
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_MC\_PTT\_NOACK
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_NON\_MC\_PTT\_NOACK
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_NON\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_NON\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_NON\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_MC\_PTT\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_NON\_MC\_PTT\_NDO

The following event parameters are updated for the INTERNAL\_PER\_CELL\_TRAFFIC\_REPORT

event to only consider VoLTE traffic:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_VOLTE
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_VOLTE
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_VOLTE
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_VOLTE
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_UNKNOWN\_VOLTE
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_VOLTE\_NOACK
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_VOLTE\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_VOLTE\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_VOLTE\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_VOLTE\_NDO
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_TX\_PCELL
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_UL\_GRANT\_CONF\_PCELL
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_TX\_PCELL
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_CONF\_PCELL
- EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_CELL\_DL\_ASSIGNMENT\_UNKNOWN\_PCELL
