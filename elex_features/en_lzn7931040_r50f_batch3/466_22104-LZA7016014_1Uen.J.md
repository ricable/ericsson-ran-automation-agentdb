# 1 Coverage-Triggered Mobility at Setup Overview

This feature improves voice setup and voice quality by moving the UE from poor LTE

coverage to a GSM or a WCDMA network when an E-RAB setup request is received for a voice

bearer.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature enables the eNodeB to monitor the uplink signal quality of the UE. If an E-RAB

setup request for a voice bearer is received in bad LTE coverage, the MME triggers

CS fallback to GERAN or UTRAN instead of setting up a voice bearer. This means that

the UE can have better voice quality.

Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered Mobility at Setup

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered Mobility at Setup

This feature redirects the UE in poor LTE coverage to a WCDMA or GSM network where

better coverage conditions apply during a voice call.

UEs in poor LTE coverage can experience better voice quality on a WCDMA or a GSM network.

The Coverage-Triggered Mobility at Setup feature measures the quality of the LTE

coverage. If the UE is in poor LTE coverage when an E-RAB setup request for VoIP is

received, the call is not set up on a VoLTE bearer. Instead, the eNodeB rejects the

VoLTE E-RAB establishment with a dedicated cause code. This causes the MME to instruct

the UE, through IMS signaling, to initiate CS fallback. The eNodeB transfers the UE to a

GERAN or UTRAN network where the better coverage provides better voice quality.

Operational Process

1. After feature activation, the eNodeB begins monitoring uplink SINR and uplink pathloss measurements of the UE.
2. When the eNodeB receives the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, the eNodeB evaluates the coverage status of the UE.
3. If the UE is in poor coverage area, the eNodeB replies with the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message with the Radio Network Layer Cause: Radio resources not available IE.
4. When the MME receives the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message, the EPC forwards it to the IMS. Depending on the call type, the following procedures can occur after the message is received:
    1. If the VoLTE call is mobile originating, the IMS sends SIP 503 to the UE. The UE performs the CS fallback procedure with the Extended Service Request message to the MME.
    2. If the VoLTE call is mobile terminating, the IMS tries again to route to the UE which triggers the CS fallback procedure.
