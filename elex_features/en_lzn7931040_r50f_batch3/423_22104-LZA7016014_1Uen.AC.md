# 1 Baseband Resource Cell Prioritization Overview

This feature enables prioritization of

selected cells for baseband module processing resources, in case the Baseband capacity

becomes a bottleneck and prevents cells from reaching their full capacity.

Summary

Depending on the site configuration, BBM processing resources can become a bottleneck and

prevent deployed cells from reaching their full capacity. This can happen based on

the number of cells, total carrier bandwidth, type (and magnitude) of the load

within the cells, and the BBM capacity itself.

This feature provides a Baseband priority setting for each cell, which then can be configured

as having either high or normal Baseband priority. Cells configured as having high

Baseband priority are prioritized during Baseband resource contention. They can

still reach their full capacity, assuming the total amount of Baseband resources are

sufficient for these cells.

The feature is useful on sites that have cells carrying important traffic such as public

safety, and where both spectrum and hardware resources must be secured to guarantee

the service of such traffic.

Traffic related to random access, paging, system information, and other non-dedicated traffic

is handled before dedicated traffic, meaning that web browsing in high priority

cells cannot affect system information broadcast in normal priority cells.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature does not work in combination with other features that enforce specific

algorithms for how to divide the Baseband resources during contention. It also does

not work with features that enforce specific algorithms for how to divide the

Baseband resources between cells, as this is the basis of Baseband Resource Cell

Prioritization.

Baseband resources are allocated for Category M and NB-IoT traffic prior to LTE

traffic. Therefore the amount of available Baseband resources are reduced for this

feature to prioritize among LTE cells.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements are expected for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Baseband Resource Cell Prioritization

The Baseband Resource Cell Prioritization

feature allows cells to be configured as high baseband priority.

The baseband priority of a cell is configured on a cell level basis in the MOM, where the

normal priority is the default. On sites where the baseband becomes a bottleneck, a cell

configured for high baseband priority is no longer prevented from reaching its full

capacity.

Operational Process

Figure 1   High Priority Cell for BBM Resources

In Figure 1, the high priority cell is

prioritized for BBM resources and is not limited. The normal priority cells share

the remaining BBM resources equally (assuming identical traffic).

# 4 Network Impact of Baseband Resource Cell Prioritization

This feature enables

selected cells to avoid capacity limitation during baseband resource contention.

Capacity and Performance

The cells selected for high Baseband priority are able to reach full capacity

regardless of the load in other cells on the same BBM, disregarding inter-cell

interference (if sharing carrier). The total BBM throughput can decrease slightly

when compared to the baseline, as the MAC scheduler becomes slightly more limited in

its choices.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

OSS 18.Q3.4\_A and ENM 18.Q3.4\_A is required for feature operation.

# 5 Parameters for Baseband Resource Cell Prioritization

The Baseband Resource Cell

Prioritization feature is controlled on a per cell basis with an introduced MOM

The observability of this feature is sustained cell throughput and QoS fulfillment for prioritized cells during BBM resource contention, and by looking at the baseband resource usage per cell. The latter can be accomplished with existing observability counters.
