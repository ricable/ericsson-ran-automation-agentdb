Summary

The TM9 Mode Switching feature chooses the optimal transmission mode with maximum two layers

for 8TX TDD, depending on channel quality. When the channel quality is good, TM3 is

selected, otherwise TM9 is used.

The feature supports 3CC downlink carrier aggregation with TM3 and TM9 mode switching in PCell

and SCell for TM9 8x2.

# 3 Feature Operation of TM9 Mode Switching

The TM9 Mode Switching feature initiates the proper transmission mode based on the

channel condition.

Operational Process

The channel conditions are evaluated periodically for each cell and UE, based on SINR

estimates in the eNodeB, see Figure 1.

- If the SINR estimate is above the threshold, the condition for TM3 Optimal Condition is fulfilled. If the UE is in TM9, a switch to TM3 is initiated.
- If the SINR estimate is below the threshold, the condition for TM9 Optimal Condition is fulfilled. If the UE is in TM3, a switch to TM9 is initiated.

Figure 1   TM9 Mode Switching Flowchart

# 4 Network Impact of TM9 Mode Switching

With the TM9 Mode Switching feature better UE throughput performance is achieved over

TM9 or TM3 alone.

Capacity and Performance

TM3 is used in good channel conditions to avoid redundant overhead. Because of a

higher throughput rate than TM3, TM9 is used in average or poor channel conditions

to take advantage of improved data transmission rate. However, TM3 has less overhead

than TM9 and therefore can deliver better throughput performance than TM9 in good

channel conditions.

Interfaces

No Impact.

Other Network Elements

Network elements are introduced in ENM version 18.01.
