# 1 Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception Overview

This feature provides uplink coordinated multi-point reception between cells that are

not in the same eNodeB with Elastic RAN. Antennas from one additional cell

that

belong to an external eNodeB are combined to enhance uplink

performance.

Summary

The Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature provides uplink coordinated

multi-point reception between cells that are not in the same eNodeB over the Elastic

RAN interface. Antennas from one additional cell, called the cooperating cell, that

belong to to an external eNodeB, called the cooperating eNodeB, are combined to

enhance the uplink performance.

The Elastic RAN feature provides high-speed, low-latency interaction between eNodeBs, which

results in effective inter-Baseband coordination for uplink coordinated multi-point

reception or carrier aggregation. The Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point

Reception feature must use a different

VlanPort

MO from the existing port used for Elastic RAN carrier aggregation. A separate fast

link is set up between the serving eNodeB and the external eNodeB for Elastic RAN

uplink coordinated multi-point reception data transmission. Soft data, which is data

after

demodulation,

is exchanged by Elastic RAN fast link from the cooperating cell to the serving cell

for the purpose of combining that data.

Both uplink coordinated multi-point reception and Elastic RAN inter-eNodeB uplink coordinated

multi-point reception can be triggered simultaneously for a user to achieve gains

from both features.

Figure 1   Triggering of Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

Uplink coordinated multi-point reception can be performed between cells that are in

different eNodeBs.

The Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature provides the

following benefits:

- Supports the simultaneous functioning of uplink coordinated multi-point reception and Elastic RAN inter-eNodeB uplink coordinated multi-point reception
- Supports TDD and FDD mixed mode to perform uplink coordinated multi-point receptionNote: TDD cells function with TDD cells and FDD cells function with FDD cells.
- Improves performance in uplink, especially for users at cell edge
- Improves coverage in uplink for PUSCH

The feature is supported with the following Line Cards and Radio Gateway units:

- Radio Gateway R308
- Radio Gateway R608
- LC-05 9xCPRI in Conversion mode

For information on hardware configurations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- The maximum number of external eNodeB partners can be six.
- External cells must have the same frequency and bandwidth as the serving cell.Note: Cells with the High Speed UE feature enabled cannot be serving cells.
- All cells included in the same Elastic RAN uplink coordinated multi-point group must belong to eNodeBs that run on the same or associated software levels.
- The Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature is not supported for eNodeBs configured with two LTE capacity modules in a mixed mode configuration.

Network Requirements

External eNodeBs must be in sync with the serving eNodeB. Elastic RAN Uplink

Coordinated Multi-Point fast link can only be set up if all cells in the two eNodeBs

have the same frameStartOffset value.

External eNodeBs must have a sufficiently low Time Alignment Error (TAE) towards the

serving eNodeB. Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception is based on the received

symbols from the UE at the secondary antenna falls within the Cyclic Prefix (CP).

The CP is used for the air propagation delay difference which maximum value is the

distance between the Primary and Secondary antennas, and the TAE between the

antennas. If the distance between the coordinated multi-point reception antennas is

less than 500 m, then the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization or the Clock Source over GPS synchronization features could be

used directly to synchronize the primary and secondary eNodeBs as they give a TAE of

maximum 3 µs. If larger distance is wished, care has to be taken to achieve better

synchronization than those sync features are specified for.

System Functions

This feature is restricted by the port to port RTT between Baseband units and the

port to port RTT between Baseband and Radio unit. RTT between Baseband units must be

no more than 60 μs and RTT between Baseband and Radio unit must be no more than 150

μs.

The feature depends on the time synchronization between the two nodes. For more

details, see Network Synchrization Guidelines.

# 3 Feature Operation of Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception sets up a separate fast link from

Elastic RAN Downlink Carrier Aggregation. The Carrier Aggregation feature and

Coordinated Multi-Point feature must be configured on two different IDLe, TN/IDL, or TN

ports.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Process Steps

1. Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception is a license-controlled feature and can only be activated when the Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception and the Elastic RAN features are activated. For more information, see Dependencies of Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.
2. Fast link setup and maintenance Setting up fast links for Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception with remote eNodeBs, using different IDLe or TN/IDL port with DL Carrier Aggregation. The maximum allowed number of cooperating cells for each serving cell is limited to eight. Reselecting higher prioritized fast link for update to get more feature gain. During eNodeB selection, higher priority is given to remote eNodeBs that contain more candidate cell relations. The selected remote eNodeB is expected to have at least one candidate cell relation. A fast link can be released because of several reasons, such as lost X2 connection, node restart, or if the serving is disabled.
3. Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception user selection. User selection is based on filtered uplink SINR. MBB, TTI Bundling VoLTE and non-TTI Bundling VoLTE users with low SINR are selected for Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.Note: VoLTE users have higher priority for Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception than MBB users, so VoLTE users experience increased uplink performance. Users with low uplink SINR (filtered SINR &lt; eranUlCompUserSelSinrThr - eranUlCompUserSelSinrHys) are selected as Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception user candidates. When the channel condition becomes better (filtered SINR &gt; eranUlCompUserSelSinrThr + eranUlCompUserSelSinrHys), users are not selected as Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception user candidates.
4. Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception cell selection. The best cooperating cell is selected for the Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception candidate user. Cell selection is based on the measured rxPuschPower result. The cell with the highest rxPuschPower is selected as the best cooperating cell. Note: EutranCellRelation.isRemovedAllowed must be set to false to forbid EutranCellRelation removal.
5. Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception. The serving eNodeB sends EranUlComp request to the cooperating eNodeB containing Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception candidate users and cells by fast link. Cooperating eNodeB receives uplink data for Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception users and sends the soft data to the serving eNodeB by fast link. Soft data is received from the external eNodeB. This is combined with soft data from the serving eNodeB to obtain Coordinated Multi-Point Reception gain.

Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception sets up a separate fast link

from Elastic RAN Downlink Carrier Aggregation, configuring a different

VlanPort using IDLe, TN/IDL, or TN ports.

There are two options for configuring Elastic RAN and Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point

with IDLe cable or Y cable:

- The cables are connected through two direct IDLe cables Two IDLe or TN/IDL ports are needed to activate Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception and carrier aggregation.
- The cables are connected through one Y IDLe cable Two IDLe links of one IDLe port are used to activate Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception and carrier aggregation. Figure 2 IDLe Cable Configuration Options For more information, see Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline .

Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception has no capacity impact since it

only uses remaining Baseband resources to perform Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated

Multi-Point Reception.

MBB

uplink

throughput is improved for MBB users, especially for cell edge users.

VoLTE

uplink performance is

improved in

both normal TTI , and TTI-Bundling

mode

for VoLTE for cell edge users.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

The

section

describes VLAN configuration basics and

limitations.

VLAN Configuration

Baseband units in one coordination group, that is, in one unit connected with fast

logical links, can be connected in the following ways:

- Using router For eNodeBs with individual VLAN IDs, the associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranUlCompVlanPortRef attribute is set to the VlanPort supporting that VLAN ID for connectivity.
- Directly through an IDLe connection For eNodeBs with direct connectivity over a different IDLe, the associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranUlCompVlanPortRef attribute is set to the VlanPort supporting that IDLe for connectivity.

VLAN configuration has

the

following

limitations:

- If the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links are torn down. The only exception is when the value of the attribute is not set and then changed to a valid VLAN port.
- If the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction MO for which the change is performed are torn down. The only exception is when the value of the attribute is not set and then changed to a valid VLAN port.
- If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attributes of the VlanPort MO under the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links are torn down.
- If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attributes of the VlanPort MO under the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction MO for which change was performed are torn down.

Parameter Tuning

When there is a short distance between cells and the overall uplink SINR is high, only a few users are triggered CoMP using the default parameter value. To increase the CoMP users, increase the values of EUtranCellFDD.eranUlCompUserSelSinrThr and EUtranCellTDD.eranUlCompUserSelSinrThr.

Critical cell edge users are allocated less CoMP resource if the following happens:

- The BBM load is very high
- A large number of users are located in cell edge
- Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception is in a bottleneck

KPI Gain Observation

The Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature is designed to bring CoMP gain only for cell edge users. The cell level throughput gain depends on the UE distribution. The CoMP gain is only noticeable when there are enough users with poor channel quality located in cell edge and trigger Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.

The throughput gain of cell edge users contributes to less cell throughput for cell center users. This means that when overall cell ulpink SINR is very high (or the number of users located in cell border is low), the cell level gain from KPI is not always obvious.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: E-RAN Uplink CoMP Performance Improvement

The

feature enhancement provides an increased uplink performance between serving and external

eNodeBs through the E5 interface.

A separate fast link is set up between serving eNodeB and external eNodeB for Elastic RAN

Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception data transmission. This is done by using a

different Inter-DU Link Ethernet (IDLe) port and a different V-LAN port with Elastic RAN

downlink carrier aggregation.

Capacity and Performance

Increased IDLe switch load to handle more fast data exchange for Elastic-RAN Uplink

Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.

MBB uplink throughput is improved for MBB users, especially for cell edge users.

VoLTE uplink performance is improved in both normal TTI and TTI-Bundling mode for

VoLTE for cell edge users.

Operation

X2 connection is required between eNodeBs to inform peer eNodeBs about the feature

activation.
