# 1 CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN Overview

The CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature enables the possibility to offer voice

services to an LTE UE without requiring IMS VoIP support.

Summary

The CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature enables eNodeBs to respond to Circuit Switched (CS)

service requests from an LTE UE. When an eNodeB receives a request, it directs the

UE to GERAN or UTRAN frequencies.

The primary CS service is traditional voice traffic. CS fallback is the only method to provide

traditional voice services for single radio UEs unless IMS VoIP services are

available.

The CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature supports the UE to release from the LTE network and

attach to the neighboring GERAN or UTRAN with minimal disruption for the end

user.

Additional Information

More information about this feature and related topics can be found in 3GPP TS 23.272

9.3.0.

This is done when performing RRC connection release 									with redirection to GERAN and UTRAN. The system information 									enables the UE to connect to the target cell faster.  The Redirect with System Information feature includes the RAN 									Information Management function. RAN Information Management is 									used for information collection from a NACC for GERAN and to 									gather system information for UTRAN. This information is 									provided to the UE that is enabling it to establish a connection 									in the cell. The connection time is reduced because of the 									system information of a cell already being present in the UE 									when redirected from LTE to GSM or WCDMA.                                                                                                    |

# 3 CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN Operation

By using the CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature, eNodeBs are enabled to respond to

Circuit Switched (CS) service requests from LTE UEs.

When an eNodeB receives a service request from an LTE UE, it directs the UE to GERAN or UTRAN

frequencies.

Operational Process

1. The UE sends an NAS extended service request to the MME requesting a CS fallback. The UE requests the CS service either as a response to a user activity in RRC Connected mode or as a response to a paging message with a CS fallback flag in RRC Idle mode.
2. The MME sends an S1-AP message with a CS fallback indicator to the eNodeB. The S1-AP message can be one of the following: A UE context modification request in RRC Connected mode. A UE context initialization request in RRC Idle mode.
3. The eNodeB selects a frequency for the redirection. The selection is based on the following: No CSFB measurements are ordered to determine what IRAT cells the UE can detect. For CS fallback started from RRC Idle mode, call establishment time can be shortened by proceeding directly with RRC connection release and skipping the following RRC messages: Security mode setup RRC connection reconfiguration Note: The skipping of the security mode setup and RRC connection reconfiguration messages can be enabled or disabled through the ENodeBFunction.csfbSkipSmcRrcFromIdleMode attribute. When several possible target frequencies have the same priority, the eNodeB applies a round robin scheme for the selection. The eNodeB takes an information element Registered LAI into account when deciding to which frequency a UE is to be redirected during a CS Fallback procedure. The information element Registered LAI can be received in the following messages: If the information element is received, it takes precedence over the priorities configured for frequencies. Otherwise legacy behavior applies.
    - UE capabilities
    - CS fallback frequency priorities defined by the following parameters: GeranFreqGroupRelation.csFallbackPrio UtranFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio UtranTDDFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio
    - Initial context setup request
    - UE context initialization request
4. The eNodeB initiates a blind RRC connection release with redirection by sending an RRC connection release message directing the UE to the selected frequency. The node also sends an S1-AP UE context release request to the MME.
5. The UE changes RAT and starts accessing the new RAT attaching to the indicated target frequency.
6. The UE sends a CM service request to the BSC or RNC. Once the request is accepted, the UE starts the CS session.

Once the UE is attached to the target RAT, it can continue to request packet switched

services if those are available.

The UE returns to E-UTRAN when it goes to RRC Idle mode and a cell

reselection is initiated.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q3: Improved CS Fallback Call Setup

Shortening CS fallback setup time and call setup time in target RAT.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node                                                                         |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                                                                                        |

The improvement gives the possibility to skip RRC messages before UE release when CS fallback

is started from RRC Idle mode, if no CS fallback measurements are

needed. It also enables that NACC information is included in the RRC connection release

message when the CS fallback measurement times out or when a CSFB-triggered handover

preparation fails. This can shorten call setup time in target RAT.

Capacity and Performance

With the improvement, CS fallback setup time can be shortened.

Benefits

Fallback direction is defined by a configurable parameter.  Based on the parameter

configuration, UEs from specific PLMNs are directed to CDMA or GERAN and UTRAN.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the PlmnInfo.actualPlmn and the

PlmnInfo.csfbTargetRat attributes for configuring the mapping

between PLMN and the domain for CSFB. These attributes must be set for all PLMNs

used in the eNodeB, otherwise the direction is set to GERAN and UTRAN for the not

configured PLMNs.

To benefit from this enhancement, the following features must be activated:

- CS Fallback to CDMA 1X
- CS Fallback to UTRAN and GERAN
- Shared LTE RAN

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.
