Summary

The Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature is an extension of the Progressive

Access Barring feature that makes it possible to bar special access classes in an

extended range of priority levels.

The Progressive Access Barring feature introduces three

different priority levels for the calculation of barring factors used for access

class             barring signaled in SIB2. It also introduces the possibility to map the following five

different traffic classes to any of the priority levels:

- Mobile Originating Data
- Mobile Originating Signaling
- CSFB
- MMTEL Voice
- MMTEL Video

The Load-Based Access Barring and Progressive Access Barring features only provide

manual configuration for Special Access Classes ranging from Access Class 10 to

15.

The Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature introduces the following

functions:

- Possibility to define the priority of individual Special Access Classes
- Possibility to automatically decide to bar individual Special Access Classes depending on the defined priority
- Possibility to extend priority level 3 and 4 for finer prioritization Note: Additional priorities can be used for the Progressive Access Barring feature without license of this feature.

Access barring prioritization of Special Access Classes is useful to give precedence to

critical services like national security or public safety under an overload

scenario.

## 2.1 Compatibility of Load Balancing and Automatic Access Barring

During ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, inter-frequency

load balancing for incoming handover is disabled in the cell.

When automatic access class barring is used together with Inter-Frequency Load Balancing,

the incoming handover to an overloaded cell is disabled.

Inter-frequency load balancing is enabled in the cell when the barring probability

reaches 0.

If load balancing during access class barring is enabled, that is

EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true, the

following events occur:

- The subscription ratio measurements are still ongoing in the cell when the automatic access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered.
- The function enables the cell for outgoing load balancing handover, and a faster recovery from overload.
- Triggering of the access class barring calculation mechanism does not disable subscription ratio evaluation and Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, by setting

the PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute to

true, and the cell is configured as

priority cell, triggering of the access class barring calculation

mechanism does not disable the following events:

- Subscription ratio evaluation
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload

A cell is configured as priority cell if the following is true:

- PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY.
- The EUtranCellFDD.ptmCellProfileRef or the EUtranCellTDD.ptmCellProfileRef reference to a cell profile is set as priority.

Example 1   Automatic Access Class Barring Disables

Load Balancing

Figure 1   Inter-Frequency Load Management Disabled by Automatic Access Barring

The following events occur during the access class barring calculation

mechanism:

1. Before t1, inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled.
2. At t1, these load balancing functions are disabled, and automatic access class barring calculation is enabled.
3. Between t1 and t4, until the automatic access class barring calculation is enabled, the load balancing functions remain disabled.
4. At t4, the barring probability reaches its minimum value, that is 0. Inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled again.
5. Between t5 and t6, inter-frequency load balancing is disabled again.
6. Between t6 and t7, outgoing inter-frequency load balancing is enabled only if EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true.
7. At t7, the barring probability reaches its minimum value again. Inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload are enabled again.

# 3 Feature Operation of Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

This feature provides the functionality to set priority level for special access classes

to decide automatically whether to bar special access classes and extend priority level from

3 to 5 for finer prioritization.

The two types of access classes are the following:

| Standard Access Classes   |    | Ranging from Access Class 0 to 9    |
|---------------------------|----|-------------------------------------|
|                           |    |                                     |
| Special Access Classes    |    | Ranging from  Access Class 10 to 15 |

The different types of special access classes are the following:

| 10   |    | Emergency Calls    |
|------|----|--------------------|
|      |    |                    |
| 11   |    | PLMN Use           |
|      |    |                    |
| 12   |    | Security Services  |
|      |    |                    |
| 13   |    | Public Utilities   |
|      |    |                    |
| 14   |    | Emergency Services |
|      |    |                    |
| 15   |    | PLMN Staff         |

All traffic classes have their own barring information of standard access classes and

special access classes in SIB2.

Barring information of Special Access Class 10 is independent from all traffic classes in

SIB2.

Operational Process

This feature uses the barring factor, translated into barring probability, and

priority level calculation procedure implemented by the Load-Based Access Barring

and the Progressive Access Barring features.

special access classes have different barring information from standard access

classes. The barring of standard access classes is interpreted as a barring factor

which can be translated into barring probability. The special access classes have

barring information, which indicates only a barred or not barred state, based on the

current barring factor and priority level.

The barring information of the special access class is set to BARRED

if any of the following cases occur:

- The priority level of the special access class is lower than the current priority level
- The priority level of the special access class is equal to the current priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level

Both standard access classes barring and special access classes barring have a

dependency within the same traffic class. The UE monitors barring information of

special access classes only when barring factor of standard access classes is set to

0. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331, Evolved

Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC);

Protocol specification.

If the barring state of any special access class is set to BARRED,

the barring factor of the standard access class belonging to the corresponding

traffic class is automatically set to 0 regardless of the

configured minimum barring factor. Because of this dependency, the priority level of

special access classes needs to be set to higher than or equal to the priority level

of standard access classes within the same traffic class.

During an ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, the handover

for inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload will be

restricted.

To activate automatic access barring of special access classes, the following steps

are required:

1. Set the priority level of special access classes using the following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence structs:
    - acBarringPrioMoDataSpecAc
    - acBarringPrioMoSignalingSpecAc
    - acBarringPrioCsfbSpecAc
    - acBarringPrioMmtelVoiceSpecAc
    - acBarringPrioMmtelVideoSpecAcs
    - acBarringPrioEmergencySpecAc
2. Set access barring mode of special access classes to AUTO.
    - Access barring mode of special access classes of each traffic class, ranging from Special Access Class 11 to 15, follows the access barring mode of standard access classes. This is set by the following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence structs: acBarringForMoDataPresence acBarringForMoSignPresence acBarringForCsfbPresence acBarringForMmtelVoicePresence acBarringForMmtelVideoPresence
    - Access barring mode of emergency Special Access Class 10 is set by the following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence structs: acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres

### 3.1.1 Manual Access Class Barring

Manual Access Class Barring is the basic access class barring functionality. The

operation of this functionality depends only on MOM configuration, and it is independent of

the traffic load situation.

The Manual Access Class Barring functionality does not require any licensed feature.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are determined

for each traffic class based on the values of the corresponding MOM attributes.

Barring factors specified in MOM are broadcast in SIB2 messages only if the presence of

each traffic class in SIB2 is set to MANUAL. If the presence of a

traffic class in SIB2 is set to any other value-OFF or

AUTO-the AC-BarringConfig element for that traffic class is not

present in SIB2.

### 3.1.2 Load-Based Access Barring

Load-Based Access Barring is the basic automatic access class barring functionality.

The operation of this functionality depends on the traffic load situation.

The Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the Load-Based Access Barring

licensed feature is activated.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.1.3 PLMN Load-Based Access Barring

PLMN Load-Based Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. The operation of this functionality

depends on both the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access barring

configuration.

The PLMN Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access

barring configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.1.4 Progressive Access Barring

Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality that

extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. This functionality prioritizes the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

Access class barring in the common access class barring parameters starts for the traffic

classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. When the barring factor reaches

the minimum barring factor for a traffic priority level access class barring is

continued on the next higher priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.1.5 PLMN Progressive Access Barring

PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality takes the

PLMN-specific access barring configuration into account when prioritizing the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms so that the traffic classes in the PLMN-specific access barring parameters are also taken into account.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.1.6 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in addition to prioritizing the traffic

classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to

true.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN priority level, the level is skipped.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are set the same value for the traffic class as the barring factors for the traffic class on the lowest PLMN priority level.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.

### 3.1.7 Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the special access class in traffic classes in addition to prioritizing the

standard access classes.

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

If the presence of a traffic class of a special access class in SIB2 is set to

AUTO, the following applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.1.8 PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access

class         barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

feature. This functionality takes the PLMN-specific access barring configuration into

account when prioritizing the special access classes for access class barring.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

There is no priority relation between PLMNs.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

### 3.1.9 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic

access class barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access

Classes feature. This functionality prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in

addition to prioritizing the special access classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to true.

If the PLMN priority is lower than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to barred.

If the PLMN priority is higher than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to not barred.

If the PLMN priority is equal to the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set as follows:

- If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

Hence, the priority relations among standard and special access classes of traffic

classes are the same within each PLMN priority level. The priority relations among

standard and special access classes of traffic classes are defined by the Progressive

Barring for Special Access Classes configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.
