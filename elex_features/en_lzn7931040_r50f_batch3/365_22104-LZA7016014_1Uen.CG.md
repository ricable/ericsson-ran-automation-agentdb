of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of ASGH Performance Package

This feature interacts with features associated with performance-related parameter

configurations.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of ASGH Performance Package

With the ASGH Performance Package feature, the following options can be applied to UEs

belonging to ASGs:

- Disabling DRX
- Resetting uplink target PSDRX
- Resetting the SubscriberGroupProfile.caRateAdjustCoeff parameter
- Configuring an upper and a lower limit on uplink MCS configured for each subscriber group for improved voice reliability. The UEs use the configured MCS limit for the MCS selection. If a UE does not belong to an ASG, the default MCS limit is used.
- Configuring fast aperiodic CQI reports for UEs with voice bearers
- Disabling SON-based measurements for features configured with the SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute

Figure 1   Feature Operation of ASGH Performance Package

## 3.1 Disabling DRX

If SubscriberGroupProfile.drxMode is set to

DISABLE\_DRX, DRX is disabled for all the users in the subscriber

group. Otherwise, the default DRX configuration is used. For exceptions, see Dependencies of ASGH Performance Package.

## 3.2 Uplink Target PSD RX Resetting

If SubscriberGroupProfile.pZeroNominalPuschOffset is set to a non-zero

value, uplink PUSCH target received power density PSD RX of all the UEs in

the advanced subscriber group becomes different from other UEs. A positive value

increases the PSDRX. A negative value decreases the PSDRX.

Otherwise, no change is made.

## 3.3 Resetting the Factor of Component Carrier Rate for Carrier Aggregation UEs in a Subscriber Group

If SubscriberGroupProfile.caRateAdjustCoeff is set to -1, the value of

CarrierAggregationFunction.caRateAdjustCoeff is used for UEs in

the advanced subscriber group. Otherwise, the value of

SubscriberGroupProfile.caRateAdjustCoeff overwrites

CarrierAggregationFunction.caRateAdjustCoeff for UEs in the

advanced subscriber group. Besides MOM description, details regarding the settings of

the CarrierAggregationFunction.caRateAdjustCoeff parameter can be

found in Minimum Rate Proportional Fair Scheduler.

## 3.4 Improved Voice Reliability with Optimized MCS

VoLTE quality can be improved by optimizing the upper and lower MCS limits.

It is recommended to configure all VoLTE UEs into one subscriber group and optimize that

subscriber group with the upper and lower MCS limits for improved VoLTE quality.

## 3.5 Fast Aperiodic CQI Reporting

The ASGH Performance Package feature enables the configuration of fast aperiodic CQI

reports for ASGs.

Fast aperiodic CQI reporting can improve the voice quality of VoLTE UEs or

mission-critical PTT UEs compared to the buffer-based dynamic aperiodic CQI reporting,

which leads to longer CQI request periods.

The function is controlled by the

SubscriberGroupProfile.fastACqiReportEnabled attribute. To save

UE battery power, it is recommended to enable fast aperiodic CQI reports only for ASGs

with the qci member of the

SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute set to

1, 65, or 66.

## 3.6 SON-Based Measurements Management

The ASGH Performance Package feature can disable SON-based measurements.

SON-based measurements configurations allow the eNodeB to react directly to changes in

the network using UEs as measurement devices to collect predefined measurements from the

network. This process can negatively affect the UE throughput.

If the SON-based measurements are disabled, the UE throughput can be improved.

The following measurements can be disabled for the UE in an ASG:

- All measurements triggered by the Automated Neighbor Relations feature
- Inter-frequency and IRAT measurements triggered by any of the following features if the measurements need measurement gap: Automatic SCell Management Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management Minimization of Drive Tests PM-Initiated UE Measurements

For disabling the measurements, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas  attribute must

include the value that corresponds the triggering feature name.

If the periodic inter-frequency measurement is enabled for the Cell Sleep Mode feature,

the measurements cannot be disabled for the Automated Neighbor Relations and the

Automatic SCell Management features for inactive UEs. The reason is that all three

features use the same inter-frequency periodic measurement function for inactive UEs.

If the inter-frequency measurement is also enabled for the Inter-Frequency Offload or for

the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, the measurements cannot be disabled for the

Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature even if the conditions are

fulfilled. The load-related features are not affected by the SON-based measurement

management.

The SON-based measurement management configuration is recommended for subscriber groups

with limited number of UEs.

# 4 Network Impact of ASGH Performance Package

This feature provides performance differentiation for a subset of UEs belonging to an

advanced subscriber group.

Capacity and Performance

When UEs that belong to a certain subscriber group gain higher performance, other UEs

can have performance reduction. The impact of the feature on the network depends on

the following:

- The degree of difference between the configuration of the UEs in the advanced subscriber group and the UEs not in the group.
- The relative proportion of the UEs in the advanced subscriber group with differentiated configurations and the UEs not in the group.

The downlink and the uplink throughput improves for UEs in the ASG if at least one

feature is included in the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute. With

this attribute, the inter-frequency and IRAT measurements are disabled, no

measurement gap or long DRX cycle for CGI measurements are needed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for ASGH Performance Package

## 9.1 Upper and Lower MCS Limits Optimization

VoLTE quality can be improved by optimizing the upper and lower MCS limits.

The MCS limits can be configured with the following attributes:

- SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsUpperLimit
- SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsLowerLimit

Setting a lower uplink MCS upper limit to VoLTE results in more uplink PRB use which

decreases cell capacity. The cell capacity decrease depends on the proportion of UEs

with VoLTE bearers and the uplink radio frequency of the UEs.

Setting a higher uplink MCS lower limit to UEs with VoLTE bearers can avoid the

segmentation of VoLTE RTP packages into too much RLC segments in bad coverage. This

can improve the voice quality of the VoLTE UEs.

## 9.2 Configure SON-Based Measurements Management

The SON-based measurements can be disabled for improved UE downlink and uplink

throughput.

The SON-based measurements can be disabled with the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute.

Features that can initiate the measurements can be included in the list of the

attribute.

Steps

1. Select the appropriate triggering feature to disable the SON-based measurements, and select the corresponding value. Table 3 SON-Based Measurements Management Configuration Triggering Feature to Disable Value Measurements to Disable Automated Neighbor Relations ANR All ANR-initiated measurements(1) PM-Initiated UE Measurements PM\_INIT\_UE\_MEAS Inter-frequency and IRAT measurements Minimization of Drive Tests MDT Inter-frequency measurements Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management BNR\_INTRA\_LTE\_LM Inter-frequency measurements Automatic SCell Management ASM Inter-frequency measurements(1) (1) If the Cell Sleep Mode feature is enabled to configure inter-frequency periodic measurements, these measurements for the feature cannot be disabled even if the conditions are fulfilled.
2. Configure the SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute with the selected value or values.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q4: Improved Voice Reliability

MCS configuration parameters are introduced to optimize the MCS

selection.

| Feature Name:           | ASGH Performance Package           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4796                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0409                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

MCS configuration is introduced for the ASGH Performance Package feature. An upper and a

lower limit on uplink MCS can be configured for each subscriber group. The UEs use the

configured MCS limit for the MCS selection. If a UE does not belong to an ASGH

subscriber group, the default MCS limit is used.

Capacity and Performance

VoLTE quality can be improved by optimizing the upper and lower MCS limits. It is recommended to

configure all VoLTE UEs into one subscriber group and optimize that subscriber group

with the upper and lower MCS limits for improved VoLTE quality.

Setting a lower uplink MCS upper limit to VoLTE results in more uplink PRB use which

decreases cell capacity. The cell capacity decrease depends on the proportion of UEs

with VoLTE bearers and the uplink radio frequency of the UEs.

Setting a higher uplink MCS lower limit to UEs with VoLTE bearers can avoid the

segmentation of VoLTE RTP packages into too much RLC segments in bad coverage. This

can improve the voice quality of the VoLTE UEs.

Operation

The following parameters are introduced:

- SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsUpperLimit
- SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsLowerLimit

If the UE does not belong to an ASGH subscriber group, the configured MCS limits do

not affect the UE.

Setting the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsUpperLimit for VoLTE UEs

to a lower value can improve the following KPIs:

| VoIP Integrity               |    | pmFlexVoipQualityRbUlOk /                                     (pmFlexVoipQualityRbUlOk +                                     pmFlexVoipQualityRbUlNok)   |

| PDCP Uplink Packet Loss Rate |    | pmFlexPdcpPktLostUl /                                     (pmFlexPdcpPktLostUl+                                     pmFlexPdcpPktReceivedUl)             |
|                              |    |                                                                                                                                                          |
| Retainability EPS Bearers    |    | (pmErabRelAbnormalEnbAct +                                 pmErabRelAbnormalMmeAct) /                                 pmSessionTimeUe [drops/sec]        |

Setting the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsLowerLimit to a higher

value can improve the following KPI for UEs with VoLTE bearers in bad coverage:

The following counters are introduced:

- pmPuschMcsDistr
- pmPuschHomMcsDistr
- pmPuschMcsVoipDistr
- pmPuschMcsSubsGroup0Distr
- pmPuschMcsSubsGroup1Distr

| Access Type            | LTE                             |

Summary and Benefits

SON-based measurement configurations allow the eNodeB to react directly to changes in

the network using UEs as measurement devices to collect predefined measurements from

the network. The measurement process can negatively affect the UE throughput.

This feature enhancement can disable the following measurements in a subscriber group

for improving the downlink and uplink UE throughput:

- All measurements triggered by the Automated Neighbor Relations feature
- Inter-frequency and IRAT measurements triggered by any of the following features if the measurements need measurement gap: Automatic SCell Management Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management Minimization of Drive Tests PM-Initiated UE Measurements

Capacity and Performance

The downlink and uplink throughput improves for the UEs in the ASG for the following

reasons:

- No measurement gap is needed for inter-frequency and IRAT measurements.
- The long DRX cycle for CGI measurements is disabled.

However, the disabled measurements can result in other performance changes.

(1)  If the

Cell Sleep Mode feature is enabled to configure

inter-frequency periodic measurements, the measurements

cannot be disabled. The reason is that these features

use the same inter-frequency periodic measurement

function for inactive UEs.(2)

If the inter-frequency measurement is also enabled

for the Inter-Frequency Offload or for the

Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, the

measurements cannot be disabled for the Best

Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

feature even if the conditions are fulfilled. The

reason is that the other load-related features are

not affected by the SON-based measurements

management.

Operation

For disabling the measurements, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute must

include the value that corresponds the triggering feature name.

If the subscriber group for the UE is updated, the measurements can be disabled or

enabled according to the updated ASGH configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
