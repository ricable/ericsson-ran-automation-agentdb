# 1 NR UE Throughput Booster Overview

This feature introduces an ASGH group for NR UEs and subscriptions and improves the

throughput by prioritizing NR UEs.

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5242                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband                                            |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0409                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature enhances the performance of EN-DC by implementing new trigger conditions

for NR UEs and subscriptions based on the ASGH framework. Both static and dynamic

groupings are supported. Static grouping of NR UEs is based on UE capability and NR

restrictions, while dynamic grouping of NR UEs is based on the EN-DC-configured

state. When the SCG radio resources are set up, the UE is selected into the NR UE

group. When the secondary node is released, the UE is removed from the NR UE group.

The feature supports both EN-DC-capable UEs and NR standalone-capable UEs.

NR UEs can be prioritized by remapping from the predefined QCIs to the

operator-defined QCIs. ASGH-based features can be applied to the grouped NR UEs to

improve their performance.

This feature has the following benefits:

- When both LTE and NR UEs are present in the network, this feature enables NR UEs to compete for more resources.
- In an EN-DC deployment, the throughput of the MCG radio resources can be improved by prioritizing EN-DC-capable UEs.
- In an NR standalone deployment, after the NR standalone-capable UE switches from the gNodeB to the eNodeB, this feature can make its priority higher than the priority of LTE UEs. This leads to better performance in the eNodeB.

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR UE Throughput Booster

The

feature enables NR UEs to compete for more resources by introducing an ASGH-based subscriber

group.

The

feature implements new trigger conditions for NR UEs and subscriptions based on the ASGH

framework.

The

feature supports

both

EN-DC-capable UEs and NR SA-capable

UEs.

For

EN-DC-configured UEs, the feature improves the MCG bearer and LTE leg of the split

bearer only, and does not impact the NR leg. NR UEs can be prioritized

by remapping from the predefined QCIs to the operator defined QCIs.

Figure 1   Feature Operation

Operational Process

1. A SubscriberGroupProfile MO must be created for the NR UE group.
2. The value of the SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerType attribute must be set to TRIGGER\_TYPE\_2.
3. If EN-DC-capable UEs and NR SA-capable UEs are sorted into separate subscriber groups, the SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList attribute can be separately configured in the appropriate SubscriberGroupProfile MO to select the correct grouping conditions for the UEs. For more information, see the MOM description of TRIGGER\_TYPE\_2 in the SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerType attribute.
4. Any LTE UE or NR UE meets the conditions of TRIGGER\_TYPE\_2, that is, all UEs are selected into NR UE group if any of the following requirements are met: The feature is deactivated. The value of the SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList attribute is set to 0.
5. One or more of the following attributes must be configured: SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI6 SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI7 SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI8 SubscriberGroupProfile.qciOffsetForQCI9 This configuration maps the predefined QCI to the operator-defined QCI for the NR UE group. The operator-defined QCI is calculated with the following equation: y Operator-defined QCI x Predefined QCI qciOffsetForQCIx This element can refer to any of the attributes that must be configured.
6. With the exception of the relativePriority parameter, the QoS parameters in the newly created QciProfileOperatorDefined MO must be configured to be consistent with the parameters in the corresponding QciProfilePredefined MO. The operator must ensure that the operator-defined QCI profile and the predefined QCI profile reference the same EN-DC profile by setting the drxProfileRef and the endcProfileRef parameters to the same value in the QciProfileOperatorDefined MO and the QciProfilePredefined MO. Note: The Operator Defined QCI feature must be activated before QCI remapping.
7. The value of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.relativePriority and the QciProfilePredefined.relativePriority attributes must be configured. The ratio of these parameters determines the throughput ratio of the LTE UEs and the NR UEs. Note: The following features must be activated based on the applicable scheduler: The Relative Priority Scheduling feature can adjust the relative priority of QCIs configured with the proportional fair scheduler. The Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling feature can adjust the relative priority of QCIs configured with the resource fair scheduler. For more information, see Relative Priority Scheduling and Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling.
8. To achieve the expected throughput ratios, the following conditions must be fulfilled: All UEs must have the same radio frequency conditions, such as SINR, CQI, and Rank Indicator values. The bit rate received for a bearer in the eNodeB must be higher than the expected rate for that bearer. The cell must be congested, that is, the PRB use must be around 90%. The maximum value for the QciProfileOperatorDefined.relativePriority attribute is recommended to be set to 600. When the Advanced Differentiation for Resource Fair Scheduling feature is enabled, the maximum value for the QciProfileOperatorDefined.relativePriority attribute is recommended to be less than 600.

This can increase the average NR UE throughput and                                     decrease the average LTE UE throughput. |
