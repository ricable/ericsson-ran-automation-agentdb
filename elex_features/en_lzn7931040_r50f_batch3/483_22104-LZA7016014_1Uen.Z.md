# 1 Reduced Connection Setup Time Overview

The feature enables an enhanced initial prescheduling procedure to speed up the connection setup time.

Summary

Reduced Connection Setup Time introduces an enhanced initial prescheduling procedure with a

dedicated parameter configuration. Enhanced initial prescheduling starts after RRC

connection setup, and ends when traffic data flow begins during the call setup.

The feature offers the following benefits:

- During call setup, control plane latency is reduced, and it is not affected by prescheduling configuration for data traffic.
- More UEs can be prescheduled at the call setup phase.

# 2 Dependencies of Reduced Connection Setup Time

The Prescheduling feature

must be active before Reduced Connection Setup Time can be activated.

Limitations

No impact.

Network Requirements

ENM version 20.1 is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Reduced Connection Setup Time

This section describes how the

prescheduling grant of the feature affects the connection setup time.

Figure 1   Reduced Connection Setup Time Procedure

The enhanced initial prescheduling starts after RRC Connection Setup and ends when the first

DRB is set-up and traffic data begins to flow. It is triggered with downlink DCCH

messages to find the uplink DCCH messages more accurately.

Although the eNodeB is configured for prescheduling, the following exceptions occur when the

prescheduling grant is not sent:

- To reduce the possibility of throughput degradation for UEs with traffic, the prescheduling candidate is not scheduled when available resources are needed by UEs with traffic.
- To avoid unnecessary UE battery consumption when the UE is in poor radio coverage, the initial prescheduling grant can be canceled by setting the SINR value or the pathloss value.
- The prescheduling grant is not sent during the connection setup phase if the ENodeBFunction.initPreschedulingEnable attribute is not enabled.

Subframe Assignment for TDD

The uplink grant is sent in the corresponding downlink subframes. In this way, the

prescheduling latency performance is the same even with a different

PrschedulingProfile.initPreschedulingPeriod attribute.

| TDD Subframe Assignment 1   |    | It is possible that the                                     PreschedulingProfile.initPreschedulingPeriod                                 attribute is set to a value less than 2 ms. In such cases, the same                                 latency performance can be achieved as when the attribute is                                 configured with 2 ms.   |
|-----------------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                             |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| TDD Subframe Assignment 2   |    | It is possible that the                                     PreschedulingProfile.initPreschedulingPeriod                                 attribute is less than 5 ms. In such cases, the same latency                                 performance can be received as when the attribute is configured with                                 5 ms.                  |
