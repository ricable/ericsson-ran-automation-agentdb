Summary

The feature introduces a machine learning algorithm to steer the existing downlink link

adaptation. The feature offers the following benefits:

- Increased UE downlink spectral efficiency
- Increased UE downlink transmitted volume
- Increased UE downlink throughput

The aim of the machine learning algorithm is to increase the

performance of the existing downlink link

adaptation.

The algorithm periodically adjusts the downlink Block Error

Rate (BLER) target to maximize spectral efficiency. This is done according to the

current inter-cell interference situation for each UE in the ASGs. The algorithm is

trained to determine the BLER target based on the interference statistics of the tracked

neighbor cells.

The machine learning algorithm sets the BLER target for the

UEs based on the history of the neighbor cell traffic activity and UE signal quality.

Each cell with dynamic BLER target keeps a periodically updated list of the tracked

neighbor cells and subscribes to periodic PRB use reports from those cells. The tracked

neighbor cells are sorted in the list based on interference strength.

Dynamic BLER target replaces the static BLER target of 10%.

Depending on the interference conditions, the chosen dynamic BLER target can be higher

or lower than 10%. In most cases, this also results in a higher or lower MCS selected

for transmission. A high BLER and high MCS can be beneficial in case of large and

unpredictable channel quality variations. Such variations are associated with inter-cell

interference scenarios with bursty traffic. Consequently, the average downlink HARQ BLER

can increase if this feature is activated.

The feature can be activated for configured ASG profiles in the following ways:

- Activated for all the UEs in the network.
- Gradually introduced for an increasing subset of the UEs.

Specific ASG profiles can be used to exclude certain UEs or services. The BLER

target range can be limited and gradually increased for the ASGs.

# 2 Dependencies of AI Powered DL Link Adaptation

The feature requires the ASGH Framework, the Automatic Neighbor Relations, and the

ASGH-Based A/B Testing Framework features to be activated. It also has other related and

conflicting features.

- Dynamic BLER target is not supported for Category M UEs. The default static BLER target is applied to such UEs.
- Dynamic BLER target is not supported in cells that have interfering cells on DU Radio Nodes or non-Ericsson nodes. The default static BLER target is applied in such cells.
- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is not supported on eNodeBs configured with two LTE capacity modules in a mixed mode configuration.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.1 or later is required for this feature.

Engineering Guidelines for AI Powered DL Link Adaptation

# 3 Feature Operation of AI Powered DL Link Adaptation

The feature sets the dynamic BLER target for UEs based on the current interference

situation in the neighbor cells.

Operational Process

1. Dynamic BLER target is activated or deactivated for the ASG profiles.
2. The tracked neighbor cell list is created and updated periodically in the serving eNodeB based on the interference strength of the neighbor cells. The tracked neighbor cell list can be adjusted with manual configuration.
3. The serving eNodeB subscribes to the activity reports from the tracked neighbor cells.
4. The tracked neighbor cells report their scheduling activity to the serving eNodeB periodically.
5. Once UE data arrives in the downlink buffer, dynamic BLER target is set for each UE in the ASGs.

## 3.1 Dynamic BLER Target

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature introduces a machine learning algorithm

that adjusts the downlink BLER target for each UE in an ASG according to the inter-cell

interference situation.

The aim of the machine learning algorithm is to increase the

performance of the existing downlink link

adaptation.

There are machine learning algorithm models available depending on the value of the

SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetAlg attribute. The models

available are the following:

- Model 0, if the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetAlg attribute is set to 0. This model optimizes more link adaptation parameters than Model 1, and improves the convergence of the downlink link adaptation algorithm for both heavy and light UE sessions.
- Model 1, if the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetAlg attribute is set to 1. This model is well tested in the field and improves the convergence of the downlink link adaptation algorithm for heavy UE sessions. Note: Model 1 is available for cases which might require backward compatibility.

The algorithm periodically adjusts the downlink Block Error

Rate (BLER) target to maximize spectral efficiency. This is done according to the

current inter-cell interference situation for each UE in the ASGs. The algorithm is

trained to determine the BLER target based on the interference statistics of the tracked

neighbor cells.

The machine learning algorithm sets the BLER target for the

UEs based on the history of the neighbor cell traffic activity and UE signal quality.

Each cell with dynamic BLER target keeps a periodically updated list of the tracked

neighbor cells and subscribes to periodic PRB use reports from those cells. The tracked

neighbor cells are sorted in the list based on interference strength.

Dynamic BLER target replaces the static BLER target of 10%.

Depending on the interference conditions, the chosen dynamic BLER target can be higher

or lower than 10%. In most cases, this also results in a higher or lower MCS selected

for transmission. A high BLER and high MCS can be beneficial in case of large and

unpredictable channel quality variations. Such variations are associated with inter-cell

interference scenarios with bursty traffic. Consequently, the average downlink HARQ BLER

can increase if this feature is activated.

The dynamic BLER target range is configured manually for each ASG. The tracked neighbor

cell list can be configured either manually or automatically by the automatic neighbor

cell ranking algorithm.

## 3.2 Neighbor Cell Activity Reporting

The feature enables the tracked neighbor cells to report their PRB use statistics to

the source cell.

Each cell with dynamic BLER target keeps a periodically updated list of the tracked

neighbor cells and subscribes to periodic PRB use reports from those cells. The tracked

neighbor cells are sorted in the list based on interference

strength.

Cells in the tracked neighbor cell list periodically report their scheduling activity to

the serving cell. If a neighbor cell in the list is served by the same eNodeB as the

serving cell, the reports are transmitted over the internal eNodeB interface. If a

neighbor cell in the list is served by a different eNodeB, the reports are transmitted

over the X2 interface.

1. The serving eNodeB requests a subscription to the PRB use statistics of the neighbor cells from the interfering eNodeB.Note: When local neighbor cell activity is reported, the serving eNodeB and the interfering eNodeB are the same.
2. The interfering eNodeB sends a list of the cell IDs with successful subscription. Note: If none of the requested cells are subscribed, the interfering eNodeB rejects the subscription procedure.
3. The subscribed neighbor cells send their PRB use statistics to the serving eNodeB periodically.

## 3.3 Operation for Voice Services

The feature is not applicable to voice services. If the feature is activated, a

static constant BLER target is assigned to all UE sessions with active voice radio bearers.

Dynamic BLER target is assigned to all other UE sessions.

Voice services are excluded from dynamic BLER target assignment because of the following

reasons:

- Voice services have strict packet delay requirements.
- HARQ BLER can increase in certain interference scenarios, which can lead to increased PDCP packet delays.

The default static BLER target is 10%. It is also possible to set a different static BLER

target for voice services. In this case, an ASG must be configured with dynamic BLER

target deactivated and service-specific BLER target activated.

Service-specific BLER target is activated with the

EUtranCellFDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute. Then, the

downlink BLER target can be configured with the

SubscriberGroupProfile.dlHarqBlerTarget attribute.

An ASG with dynamic BLER target deactivated must be configured for voice services if at

least one ASG is created for MBB traffic with dynamic BLER target activated and the

SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute set to

lower than 100.

PM Event-Based Performance Evaluation

The feature increases spectral efficiency for UE sessions with large transmitted data

volume for Model 1. Because of the small proportion of these UE sessions compared to

all data sessions, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of the feature with

the available PM counters and KPIs. This is because PM counters that measure

throughput and spectral efficiency are aggregated over all UE sessions and all

cells. Therefore, even large performance changes associated with the heavy UE

sessions result in small or negligible changes in the PM counters.

To measure the performance gains more precisely, PM events that are defined in CTR

can be activated and collected in the evaluated cells. The gains can be measured by

using PIs that include heavy or light UE sessions.

To evaluate performance, the following PM events need to be activated:

- INTERNAL\_PROC\_RRC\_CONN\_SETUP
- INTERNAL\_PROC\_RRC\_CONNECTION\_RE\_ESTABLISHMENT
- INTERNAL\_PROC\_UE\_CTXT\_RELEASE
- INTERNAL\_PROC\_S1\_SIG\_CONN\_SETUP
- INTERNAL\_PER\_UE\_TRAFFIC\_REPORT
- INTERNAL\_PER\_UE\_RB\_TRAFFIC\_REP
- INTERNAL\_PER\_RADIO\_UE\_MEASUREMENT

The following PM event-based PIs can be used for observation:

- UE throughput for heavy UE sessions in an ASG
- UE spectral efficiency for heavy UE sessions in an ASG
- UE throughput for heavy UE sessions in medium-to-poor radio conditions in an ASG
- UE spectral efficiency for heavy UE sessions in medium-to-poor radio conditions in an ASG

For more information on PM event-based PI formulas, see Formulas for Performance Evaluation.

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012505 MO instance.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for AI Powered DL Link Adaptation

## 9.1 Configure the Tracked Neighbor Cell List

The feature enables the configuration of the tracked neighbor cell list of the

serving cell. Manual configuration can be mixed with automatic configuration.

Automatic and manual configuration can be mixed for cells on the same frequency

relation. Manual configuration is prioritized and overrides the automatically

calculated rank.

Mixing automatic and manual configuration is needed when a strongly interfering

neighbor cell does not have the feature activated. Therefore, the neighbor cell

cannot report scheduling activity. Such a cell can be overridden in the tracked

neighbor cell list by another cell.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellRelation.reportDlActivity attribute for all the neighbor relations to AUTO.
2. Set the EUtranCellRelation.reportDlActivity attribute for the neighbor relation to be removed to DISABLED.
3. Check the rank of the removed neighbor in the EUtranCellRelation.interferenceScoreDl attribute.
4. Set the EUtranCellRelation.reportDlActivity attribute for the neighbor relation to be added to ENABLED\_X, where X is the rank of the removed neighbor.

Example 1   Mixed Configuration Example

In this example, cells A, B, and F cannot report their scheduling activity.

In Table 7, the tracked neighbor cells are

C, E, and A. In this case, cell A needs to be replaced by the first cell in the

ranked list that can report its scheduling activity, which is cell D.

## 9.2 Configure an ASG with Dynamic BLER Target

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature enables the configuration of a dynamic BLER

target for ASGs.

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is beneficial for services without strict

packet delay requirements, for example internet traffic. The feature introduces a

machine learning algorithm that periodically adjusts the downlink BLER target for

each UE in the configured ASGs. This is done according to the current inter-cell

interference situation.

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Create a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance to define the ASG.
2. Define the percentage of the UE population to be included in the ASG by setting the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to a positive value. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is higher than 60. The maximum BLER target can be decreased, if any of the following PIs increase: PDCP Downlink Packet Loss Rate DL RLC Error Rate
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMin attribute. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is lower than 10 except in case of low load in the cell. If the cell load is low, the default value of 1 can be used to improve performance.

## 9.3 Configure an ASG with Static BLER Target for VoLTE UEs

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated, an ASG with static

downlink BLER target can be configured for VoLTE UEs.

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is not applicable to voice services. If the

feature is activated, a static constant BLER target is assigned to all UE sessions

with active voice radio bearers. Dynamic BLER target is assigned to all other UE

sessions.

An ASG with dynamic BLER target deactivated must be configured in the following

cases:

- If at least one ASG is created for MBB traffic with dynamic BLER target activated and the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute set to lower than 100.
- If service-specific BLER target is used.

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Create a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance to define the ASG.
2. Set the qci member of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute to 1.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 10, or a value that is higher than the other ASGs.
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1 to configure a static BLER target of 10%.

## 9.4 Configure ASGs for A/B Testing

A/B testing can be used to gradually introduce the feature in a network and evaluate

performance.

Two ASGs are needed for A/B testing. One ASG needs to be configured with dynamic BLER

target activated and one with dynamic BLER target deactivated. Both ASGs operate at

the same time in the same cells. In the most common test scenario, each ASG is

assigned 50% of the active UEs with MBB traffic.

This setup allows the use of flexible counters and performance indicators based on PM

events can be used to compare the performance of the ASGs in real time.

In this configuration example, the following ASGs are created for an A/B testing

setup:

- An ASG with high priority and static BLER target for VoLTE bearers
- An ASG with medium priority and dynamic BLER target activated for 50% of the UEs with MBB traffic
- An ASG with low priority and dynamic BLER target deactivated for 50% of the UEs with MBB traffic

Steps

1. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for VoLTE UEs.
    1. Set the qci member of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute to 1.
    2. Set theSubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 10.
    4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 100.
2. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for MBB UEs with medium priority and dynamic BLER target activated.
    1. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to a positive value. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is higher than 60.
    2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMin attribute. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is lower than 10 except in case of low load in the cell. If the cell load is low, the default value of 1 can be used to improve performance.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 5.
    4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 50.
3. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for MBB UEs with low priority and dynamic BLER target deactivated.
    1. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1.
    2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 1.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 100.

Parameters for AI Powered DL Link Adaptation

## 9.5 Activate Dynamic BLER Target with Service-Specific BLER Target

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated, dynamic BLER target can be

used together with service-specific BLER target.

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature and service-specific BLER target are

activated together, separate ASGs can be configured to use dynamic BLER target or

static BLER target optimized for a specific service.

In this configuration example, the following ASGs are created:

- An ASG for VoLTE UEs with a static BLER target of 5%
- An ASG for UEs with MBB traffic with a dynamic BLER target range of [10, 60]

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Activate service-specific BLER target by setting the EUtranCellFDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute to 1.
2. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for VoLTE UEs.
    1. Set the qci member of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute to 1.
    2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlHarqBlerTarget attribute to 5.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1.
    4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 10.
    5. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 100.
3. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for MBB UEs.
    1. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to 60.
    2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMin attribute to 10.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 1.
