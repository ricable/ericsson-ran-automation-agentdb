Summary

The Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release feature is one of the Load Management

features. This feature uses the functions of the Load-Based Distribution at Release

feature for distributing traffic load between LTE frequency carriers at RRC

Connection Release. It introduces a more cognizant way for load distribution by

taking target frequency load and coverage information into consideration.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- The feature evaluates not only the source-cell load, but the target-cell load as well when distributing traffic load in the network.
- Highly loaded frequencies are avoided as highest priority in the IMMCI, even if they are not configured as a target frequency.
- Frequencies with low coverage overlap are avoided as highest priority in the IMMCI, even if they are not configured as a target frequency.

Traffic load information exchange requires an X2 connection between the source and

target eNodeBs.

# 3 Feature Operation of Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release

Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release is a licensed feature, which enhances the

legacy Load-Based Distribution at Release feature by considering the load and coverage

probability of potential target cells.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram, Part 1

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram, Part 2

1. The UE release is triggered. Legacy requirements for Load-Based Distribution at Release are checked to decide whether the UE is to be affected by Load-Based Distribution at Release at all.
2. When the UE is classified as a candidate for Load-Based Distribution at Release, the load state in the cell is checked and compared with load thresholds to decide which Load-Based Distribution at Release profile is selected from IdleModePrioAtRelease for load distribution algorithms.
3. The Load-Based Distribution at Release functionality filters candidate frequencies for the UE by removing unsupported ones because of UE capability and restricted ones because of HLR. In this step, the new target cell load filtering functionality introduced by Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release is also applied when LoadBalancingFunction.targetLoadAwareLbdar is true. If the frequency is considered as highly loaded, that is, at least one of the cells with load-balancing relations has its subscription ratio above IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadThreshold, then it is down-prioritized from candidate frequencies. If all potential target frequencies are highly loaded, then target load becomes irrelevant. Consequently, if the Target Cell Coverage function is not enabled, then legacy Load-Based Distribution at Release behavior applies. To consider target cell load, Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release requires the prerequisite features Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and Load-Based Distribution at Release to be active.
4. The target cell coverage functionality is enabled if the LoadBalancingFunction.coverageAwareLbdar attribute is set to true. If the frequency is considered to have low coverage overlap, that is, if the aggregated hit rate on the target frequency is less than or equal to the EUtranCellFDD.lbdarCoverageThreshold or the EUtranCellTDD.lbdarCoverageThreshold attribute, it is filtered out from candidate frequencies. If all potential target frequencies have low coverage overlap, then target coverage becomes irrelevant. Consequently, if the Target Cell Load function is not enabled, then legacy Load-Based Distribution at Release behavior applies. To evaluate target coverage probability, Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release requires the prerequisite features Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management and Load-Based Distribution at Release to be active. Also, the EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy attribute must not be set to NOT\_ALLOWED to consider hit rate on a frequency.
5. The legacy Load-Based Distribution at Release algorithms pick the highest priority frequency randomly according to the Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release filtered DistributionInfo and assign it CRP 7. Frequencies are then down-prioritized according to Load-Based Distribution at Release functionality to avoid having undesired frequencies on CRP 7. Only the ones selected by Load-Based Distribution at Release can have the highest CRP.
6. If both Target Cell Load and Target Cell Coverage functionalities are enabled simultaneously, then Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release down-prioritizes frequencies which are either heavily loaded or have poor coverage overlap, or both. They are given lowest priority among existing E-UTRAN frequencies.
7. The RRC Connection Release message is sent containing IMMCI with frequencies prioritized according to the above steps. Note: The subpriority information field is also included in IMMCI, if all the following conditions are true: The cell reselection subpriority for an NR frequency is set to a value other than zero in the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute. The UE is NR standalone-capable.

## 3.1 Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users

Selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility

feature if the subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the

configurable threshold.

If the LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users feature is

activated, a subscription ratio threshold can be defined for the serving cell. If the

subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the defined threshold,

the selected high-priority UEs are handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature.

If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the defined threshold, the

selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the following features, if they are

activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

The high-priority UEs can be selected using the following attributes:

- RATFreqPrio.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl
- UeProfileFilter.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl

The subscription ratio threshold can be defined using one of the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr
- EUtranCellTDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr

For more information, see LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for

High-Priority Users.

# 4 Network Impact of Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release

The feature affects traffic load distribution.

Capacity and Performance

The feature down-prioritizes highly loaded and low coverage target frequencies so

traffic is distributed in a more cognizant way. Performance of the network can

increase because there are fewer UEs trying to attach to overloaded cells, to cells

with low coverage, or both.

Interfaces

A new IE in private messages is introduced containing information regarding the cell

high load status.

Other Network Elements

The feature requires ENM version 19.13 or later.

# 5 Parameters for Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release

The feature introduces three new attributes.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release

Target Cell Load

The evaluation of target cell load is enabled by setting the

LoadBalancingFunction.targetLoadAwareLbdar attribute to

true.

Target Cell Coverage

The evaluation of target cell coverage probability is enabled by setting the

LoadBalancingFunction.coverageAwareLbdar attribute to

true.

Required Load-Based Distribution at Release Configuration

Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release compares the load calculated by

Inter-Frequency Load Balancing to the value of

IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadThreshold on each cell. It

means that each cell must have Load-Based Distribution at Release profile configured

(EUtranCellFDD.idleModePrioAtReleaseRef or

EUtranCellTDD.idleModePrioAtReleaseRef set to valid instance

of IdleModePrioAtRelease MO) so that it has

IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadThreshold assigned. If no

profile is configured for the cell, or the license for Load-Based Distribution at

Release is not enabled, the cell reports its own load as not highly loaded.

Required Inter-Frequency Load Balancing Configuration

In order for Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release to work correctly, the load

information exchange mechanism provided by Inter-Frequency Load Balancing or

Accelerated Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is needed. During every load balancing

cycle, each cell calculates its load for inter-frequency load balancing purposes and

then compares it with the value of the

IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadThreshold attribute to decide

whether the cell is highly loaded or not. This information is populated to other

cells.

To achieve this, load balancing relations have to be created by setting the

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute to

ALLOWED. Also, the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load

Management feature automatically configures load balancing relations. When the load

balancing relation is created from Cell1 to Cell2, and Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing is enabled on both sides, Cell2 reports its own high load status to Cell1.

If communication in both ways is needed, then the load balancing relation from Cell2

to Cell1 has to be created as well.

Required Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management

Configuration

The Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature calculates hit rate

for each target cell. To estimate the hit rate value for each target cell, various

UEs in the source cell must be measured on the target frequencies. For this, the

EUtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy attribute must not be set to

NOT\_ALLOWED. Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release

aggregates the hit rate of cells for each frequency relation and compares it with

the value of the EUtranCellFDD.lbdarCoverageThreshold or the

EUtranCellTDD.lbdarCoverageThreshold  attribute. Evolved

Load-Based Distribution at Release removes low coverage frequencies from the

DistributionInfo list and down prioritizes them in IMMCI by

setting the lowest priority for them among existing E-UTRAN frequencies. A frequency

is considered to have low coverage overlap if its aggregated hit rate value is below

than or equal to the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.lbdarCoverageThreshold or the

EUtranCellTDD.lbdarCoverageThreshold attribute.
