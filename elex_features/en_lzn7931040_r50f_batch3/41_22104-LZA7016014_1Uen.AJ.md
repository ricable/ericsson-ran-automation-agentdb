# 1 Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback Overview

The Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback feature offers the operator the possibility

to apply separate priorities for CS fallback for emergency calls as compared to CS fallback

for ordinary voice calls.

| Feature Name           | Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 0921                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                                           |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature enables the operator to apply unique frequency and frequency group priorities for

emergency calls in UTRAN, GERAN and CDMA networks. This way, the emergency calls can

be directed to the network resources that are the best to handle these calls. The

operator may prefer to use the UTRAN network as CS fallback for ordinary calls,

while the GERAN network is preferred for emergency calls. When the eNodeB receives a

CS Fallback request from the MME indicating an emergency call, the eNodeB applies

the priorities for emergency call CS fallback when selecting the frequency or

frequency group to which CS fallback is applied.

This feature allows the operator to direct emergency calls to the network that has

the positioning performance and thus comply to the FCC phase 2 requirements on

positioning accuracy for such calls.

If the Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback feature is not activated, the eNodeB

applies the CS fallback priorities for normal calls. If the Emergency Call Handling

for CS Fallback feature is activated but the priority parameters is not configured,

the default value (=0, lowest priority) is applied.

The feature introduces counters to enhance the observability of CS Fallback for emergency

calls.

Additional Information

Further information about this feature and related topics can be found in the 3GPP TS 23.272-

Circuit Switched (CS) fallback in Evolved Packet System (EPC); Stage 2

documentation.

# 3 Feature Operation of Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback

The Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback feature enables the operator to apply unique

frequency and frequency group priorities for emergency calls.

Operational Process

The operator needs to enter the priority level for each UTRAN frequency, each CDMA

frequency, and each GERAN frequency group with a relation to the cell. If the same

priority is set for two or more frequencies or frequency groups, no deterministic

prioritization among those takes place. To achieve a deterministic behavior each

frequency or frequency group must have a unique priority. As an example, the

operator might prefer to use the UTRAN network as CSFB for ordinary calls while the

GERAN network is preferred for emergency calls.

# 4 Network Impact of Emergency Call Handling for CS Fallback

This feature has no impact on the network.

No impact.

Interfaces
