# 1 DSCP Mapping Based on ARP and QCI Overview

This feature introduces support for DSCP configuration in the transport network QoS

based on ARP and QCI.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature extends and enhances the possibility to configure DSCP used for transport network

QoS. It is possible to configure different DSCP values based on different ARP and

QCI pairs provided by the MME. The operator can prioritize traffic based on both ARP

and QCI with this feature. This way UEs can have different QoS used by the transport

network QoS. The transport network QoS determines traffic classification and quality

for network data.

The feature introduces the following parameters to configure a DSCP for each ARP:

- QciProfilePredefined.dscpArpMap
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscpArpMap

The feature does not have a direct impact on the network capacity, performance, or

interfaces.

| Feature                                                             | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operator Defined QCI (FAJ                                 121 1892) | Related        | The Operator Defined QCI feature enables the operator to             define and use custom QCI profiles. If the DSCP Mapping Based on ARP and QCI and the             Operator Defined QCI features are used together, the DSCP can be configured with both             ARP and QCI. |

Network Requirements

This feature requires ENM version 19.4 or later to be used.

# 3 Feature Operation of DSCP Mapping Based on ARP and QCI

This feature allows differentiated QoS handling based on ARP and QCI.

The transport network QoS in the S1 bearer towards the SGW considers the mapping of DSCP

based on ARP and QCI with this feature. This is configurable with the

QciProfilePredefined.dscpArpMap and

QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscpArpMap parameters.

The feature uses the following messages sent to the eNodeB that contain the QCI and ARP

priority level:

- S1AP Initial Context Setup Request
- S1AP E-RAB Setup
- S1AP E-RAB Modify
- Outgoing X2 Handover
- RRC Connection Reestablishment

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The eNodeB receives an incoming bearer request. It contains the QCI and ARP priority level.
2. The eNodeB checks the received QCI parameter. Note: QCI 65, QCI 66, QCI 69, and QCI 70 are considered predefined QCI profiles if the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is activated.
    1. If the Operator Defined QCI feature is activated and the received QCI is in the operator defined QCI profile range [10-255], the QciProfileOperatorDefined MO class is used.
    2. If the received QCI parameter is in the predefined QCI profile range [0-9, 65, 66, 69, 70], the QciProfilePredefined MO class is used.
3. The eNodeB checks if the feature license is activated.
    1. If the feature is not activated, the value of the QciProfilePredefined.dscp or the QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscp attribute is used and the operation is finished.
    2. If the feature is activated, the value of QciProfilePredefined.dscpArpMap or QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscpArpMap is used for the given ARP value. Note: If the QciProfilePredefined.dscpArpMap or QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscpArpMap is set to the default value, the value of the QciProfilePredefined.dscp or QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscp attribute is used.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for DSCP Mapping Based on ARP and QCI

The feature needs to be activated and configured to be operational.

If the feature is activated and the QciProfilePredefined.dscpArpMap or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscpArpMap is set to a value different

from the default value, the configured values are used for DSCP mapping.

If the feature is activated and the QciProfilePredefined.dscpArpMap or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscpArpMap is set to the default value,

the value of QciProfilePredefined.dscp or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.dscp is used for DSCP mapping.
