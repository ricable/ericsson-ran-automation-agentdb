# 1 Load-Based CA SCell Handling Overview

The Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature allows prioritization of cell resources for RRC

connected users in high load conditions. UEs that use the cell through Carrier Aggregation

(CA) as SCell are blocked in high load conditions, so that RRC connected users can utilize

the full spectrum of the cell resources.

Summary

The feature is used to prioritize cells needed for prioritized traffic. The feature ensures

that cell resources are only used by RRC connected users when cell resource

starvation occurs. This is useful when a cell is used as an additional component

carrier by other users. In this case, the feature allows RRC connected users to

utilize all the resources of the prioritized cell. Prioritized traffic is not

compromised by users that use the cell as CA SCell.

Cell resource starvation can occur in the following cases:

- High traffic
- Increased signaling
- Increased carrier aggregation traffic

The feature monitors cell resource use based on configurable thresholds. When cell resource

use exceeds the configured limits, CA SCell traffic does not receive any resources.

This blocks users on the prioritized cell who use the cell as CA SCell.

The feature is FDD only.

# 2 Dependencies of Load-Based CA SCell Handling

The feature needs Carrier Aggregation to be active. All carrier aggregation-related

features are affected.

# 3 Feature Operation of Load-Based CA SCell Handling

The feature blocks CA SCell users of the cell if at least two of the five possible

traffic load measurements cross the traffic load thresholds. The thresholds can be

configured by the operator or a default value can be used.

There are five traffic load measurements. Traffic load measurements are

applied to MSRs. MSRs include hardware and software resources, as well as license

limited resources on both cell and RBS level. MSRs can include the following

resources:

- PRBs
- CCEs
- scheduling elements
- baseband capacity

The use of the MSRs is measured during a measurement period after which a filtered value

is calculated for the MSR use. The filtered value of MSR use is updated after each new

measurement period.

The following MSRs are considered:

- UL PRB use for each cell
- DL PRB use for each cell
- UL SE use for each cell
- DL SE use for each cell
- CCE use

The cell has a new measurement period every 100 milliseconds. The operator sets a low and

a high threshold for all five measurements or the default values are used. The

thresholds are based on the percentage of the maximum utilization. Each threshold can be

individually tuned to a custom value. The default value of the parameters can be used

for simple configuration. The high and low threshold parameters are found in

EUtranCellFDD.loadBasedCaMsrThr.

The struct members of the struct LoadBasedCaMsrThr are used for

configuration of the high and low thresholds.

The feature blocks the CA SCell users when at least two measurement values exceed the

high thresholds. When all traffic load indicators fall under the low thresholds, the

cell switches back to legacy functionality, and CA SCell traffic is allowed on the cell

again.

The feature measures the traffic load indicators on the cell every 100 milliseconds.

If the measurements are below the high thresholds, the cell maintains legacy

functionality.

When the CA SCell users are blocked on the cell, the following read-only attributes

of the MO instance of the cell change to true:

- EUtranCellFDD.caLockDueToHighLoad
- ExternalEUtranCellFDD.caLockDueToHighLoad

When the CA SCell users are allowed to use the cell, the attribute changes to

false.

The eNodeB notifies the other eNodeBs that are connected with an X2 interface about

the load state on a cell. If the

EUtranCellFDD.caLockDueToHighLoad

or

ExternalEUtranCellFDD.caLockDueToHighLoad

attribute is true for a cell, that cell is excluded from the

candidate list for configuration as an SCell. No RRC configuration is initiated for

that cell while there is high load on the cell.

When the cell enters a high load state and the LOCAL\_EVENT\_CELL\_CA\_LOCKED\_HL\_TIME

event is triggered, the

EUtranCellFDD.pmCellCaLockTimeHighLoad

counter is started. This counter measures the that time the cell spends in high load

state in seconds.

If the Load-Based CA SCell Handling and Carrier

Aggregation-Aware IFLB features are activated simultaneously, the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling is

affected by the Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature operation. When

ExternalEUtranCellFDD.caLockDueToHighLoad

is true, the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling

attribute changes to 0. If the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling has

a value of 0, the cell is not considered to be configured

as a CA SCell.

Example 1   Load-Based CA SCell Handling Feature

Operation

For simplicity, the high and the low thresholds are shown as equal percentage for

each traffic load indicator. The thresholds can be set different for any two

traffic load indicators.

1. Every traffic load indicator is below the high threshold.
2. One of the traffic load indicators exceeds the high threshold. Legacy functionality is maintained because only one measurement passed the high threshold.
3. Another traffic load indicator exceeds the high threshold while the first one is still above the high threshold. The users using the cell as SCell are blocked from the prioritized cell. The users blocked from the cell can use other CA SCells.
4. All but one of the traffic load indicators falls under the low threshold.
5. Every traffic load indicator falls under the low threshold. The feature allows CA users to use the cell as SCell.
6. A traffic load indicator exceeds the high threshold.
7. A second traffic load indicator exceeds the high threshold while the first one is still above the high threshold. The users using the cell as SCell are blocked from the prioritized cell. The users blocked from the cell can use other CA SCells.
8. A third traffic load indicator exceeds the high threshold while the first two are still above the high threshold. No CA SCell traffic is allowed on the cell.
9. Three traffic load indicators fall under the low threshold. No CA SCell traffic is allowed on the cell.
10. A fourth traffic load indicator falls under the low threshold while one is between the high and low thresholds. No CA SCell traffic is allowed on the cell, until every traffic load indicator falls under the low threshold.

# 4 Network Impact of Load-Based CA SCell Handling

RRC connected users of the cell where the feature is operational have higher throughput,

when there is high load on the cell. UEs that use the prioritized cell as CA SCell have

decreased throughput if the feature is activated, and no other SCells are

available.

Capacity and Performance

The feature blocks UEs that use the prioritized cell as CA SCell, if the traffic load

is higher than the threshold. This increases throughput for RRC connected UEs of the

prioritized cell and decreases throughput for the CA SCell users.

Interfaces

Information about the cell load state is signaled over the X2 interface. A timer is

introduced to mitigate the X2 overhead signaling impact at frequent cell load state

changes.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Load-Based CA SCell Handling

The feature affects KPIs associated with CA. CA SCell users of the prioritized cell need

to find another cell to use as SCell in case of high traffic load on the prioritized cell.

This means that the performance impacts can be observed on other cells than the prioritized

cell.

KPIs

The table lists the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with the

feature, and the expected impact.

# 7 Activate Load-Based CA SCell Handling

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012296 MO instance.

After This Task

- The feature has to be enabled on each cell to be operational.
- Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Load-Based CA SCell Handling

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012296 MO instance.

After This Task

- The feature stops working after cell lock/unlock for the appropriate cell.
- Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Load-Based CA SCell Handling

There are default values set for the load thresholds for easy setup of the feature.

The default threshold settings can be configured to fit a specific cell

configuration.

The feature has to be enabled in each cell where it needs to operate.

EUtranCellFDD.loadBasedCaMsrThr

contains the traffic load thresholds. The five low and high thresholds are configured

with the struct members of the struct LoadBasedCaMsrThr. The values are set in the percentage of

the maximum utilization.

The thresholds can be fine-tuned for each cell. If there are higher values for the

thresholds, the RRC connected user traffic receives less of the cell resources, while

SCell traffic is allowed to use more of the cell resources. Setting lower threshold

values mean more resources can be utilized by the RRC connected users, because the CA

SCell traffic is blocked on the cell sooner.

Table 7   Recommended Threshold Configuration

| Measurement                       | Corresponding Struct Member   |   Recommended Value |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| DL PRB use low threshold          | dlPrbUtilThreshLow            |                  20 |
| DL PRB use high threshold         | dlPrbUtilThreshHigh           |                  30 |
| UL PRB use low threshold          | ulPrbUtilThreshLow            |                  25 |
| UL PRB use high threshold         | ulPrbUtilThreshHigh           |                  30 |
| DL SE for each TTI  low threshold | dlSeUtilThreshLow             |                  40 |

Benefits

The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature continuously estimates the maximum amount

of dynamic resources needed in downlink for PTT traffic. PTT reservations are

immediately updated when admitting or releasing PTT bearers. By activating the

enhancement, the algorithm of the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature becomes

available for the affected features and function. They become capable for

considering the dynamic PTT downlink MSR reservation at MSR use calculation. The

enhancement ensures the following benefits for the following affected features and

function:

- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature allows only those UEs to be admitted that can be adequately served.
- The Preferential Traffic Management function improves blocking handovers for non-priority UEs and blocking idle mode camping when PTT UEs are present in the eNodeB. This feature is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.
- The Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature improves prioritizing cell resources for RRC connected users if there is high load.
- An attribute is introduced for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature to control the rejection of the privileged access bearer setup requests. Also, improved handover and re-establishment rejection observability is ensured for the Dynamic GBR Admission Control and the Enhanced PTT Admission Control features. Dynamic GBR Admission Control is a prerequisite feature for the Enhanced PTT Admission Control.

For more information about the operation of the Enhanced PTT Admission Control

feature and this enhancement, see the following documents:

- Enhanced PTT Admission Control
- Dynamic UE Admission Control
- Dynamic GBR Admission Control
- Load-Based CA SCell Handling
- Preferential Traffic Management

Capacity and Performance

When the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is activated, it dynamically reserves

resources for PTT users. This can impact the node capacity beside providing stable

performance in high load cases with PTT service active.

Operation

The enhancement introduces three new parameters related to dynamic reservation of

resources for PTT users and resource use for privileged access users.
