Summary

The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature introduces the call queuing

function. Connections that are about to be rejected by the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature due to overload are queued instead. This behavior facilitates UE

admission in the eNodeB on the cell level. The call queuing function enables

rejected calls to start reconnection before the blocking period of the Dynamic UE

Admission Control feature expires. The call queuing function protects the eNodeB

from being overloaded. Reconnection attempts for the queued calls are only allowed

at MSR updates during the blocking period of the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature.

The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature has the following benefits:

- Improved accessibility during overload periods
- Better and more stable resource use
- More responsive Dynamic UE Admission Control feature during dynamic MSR oscillations
- Higher chance for the UEs to be admitted faster by the system in high-load conditions

# 3 Feature Operation of Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load

This feature enables the queuing of incoming initial RRC connection requests that are

about to be rejected by the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature because of overload.

The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature operates if the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature is activated. In case of overload, the call queuing function is enabled

automatically for non-privileged access (non-PA) user requests. The privileged access

(PA) user requests are handled in the following way:

- If the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated, the call queuing function is enabled automatically for PA user requests.
- If the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is not activated, all PA connection requests are admitted.

The following types of requests are considered to be PA:

- RRC connection requests with emergency or high priority access establishment causes.
- For handover requests and RRC connection reestablishment requests, where any of the E-RABs has an Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level value equal to or below that of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. Call queuing function is not available for handover requests and RRC connection reestablishment requests.
- When the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature is activated, the mobile-terminating access requests with paging priority higher than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This threshold is configured by the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute.

This feature operates on the cell level.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Successful Call Queuing Function Process

1. The RRCConnectionRequest message is rejected by the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature because of MSR overload.
2. The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature enables the automatic queuing of the rejected RRCConnectionRequest message.
3. When the remaining time of the MSR update period expires, a reconnection attempt is allowed. If there are queued messages, a reconnection attempt is started by pulling the next message from the queue. The selection of the next message is based on priority and on the time spent in the queue.
4. The reconnection attempt is continued by allocating SRB1 for the pulled message. If the congestion ceases, SRB1 allocation is completed successfully. If SRB1 allocation fails, the message returns to the queue. In this case, pulling messages from the queue restarts after the MSR update period expires.
5. The message is removed from the queue. RRC connection is established successfully and the state of the UE becomes RRC\_Connected.

## 3.1 Queue Management

Call Queuing Function Use Cases

RRCConnectionRequest messages are queued in the following cases:

- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature is in blocking state.
- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature admits the message, but SRB1 allocation fails because of MSR overload.
- Messages with the same priority are already queued. In this case, no immediate admission is available for the message, until all the earlier queued messages with the same priority are pulled out from the queue.

Pulling Messages from the Queue

Each message is either admitted or released from the queue because of a queue

time-out. If the adaptive queue pulling function is disabled, each message is pulled

from the queue at a fixed interval (20 ms) after the successful SRB1 allocation of

the previous message. If the operator enables adaptive queue pulling, the feature

ensures this function for emptying the queue.

With

adaptive queue pulling, system load determines the regularity of pulling messages

from the queue. In case of higher load, less frequent pulling protects the system

from overload. In case of lower load, the queue is emptied at a faster rate.

Each message is pulled from the queue after the successful SRB1 allocation of the

previous message. Adaptive queue pulling is disabled by default. If the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueAdaptivePulling or the

EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueAdaptivePulling attribute is set to

TRUE, the adaptive queue pulling function is enabled. The

default value of these attributes is FALSE.

The time a message can spend in the queue, is configured using the

EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio or the

EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio attributes. A message can be

queued and pulled from the queue multiple times until the configured time expires.

If the queuing happens because of persistent overload, and the configured time for

being queued expires, the message is released from the queue. The

RRCConnectionReject message is sent to the UE.

If a cell is locked manually, all queued messages are released from the queue and

rejected.

Prioritizing Messages Within the Queue

The following rules apply to message prioritization:

- Messages with higher priority are pulled from the queue before messages with lower priority. PA messages have the highest priority. If the Optimized VoLTE Access at High Load feature is activated, the RRCConnectionRequest messages of the mobile-originating voice type have the second highest priority. In this case, non-mobile-originating voice messages are pulled out after mobile-originating voice messages.
- Among messages with the same priority, the message that spent the longest time in the queue is pulled out first. In case of a message that was pulled out and returned to the queue multiple times, its original time stamp is considered as pulling prioritization criterion.

Queue Overflow

Queue size is provided by the system. A fixed number of messages (40 pieces) can be

kept in the queue. If it is full, queue overflow occurs. In such cases, higher

priority messages such as PA or mobile-originating voice messages are added to the

queue in place of a lower priority message. This lower priority message is discarded

from the queue, generating the RRCConnectionReject message for the

UE.

In case of a queue overflow, if the

priority of the new RRCConnectionRequest message is not higher than that of other

messages in the queue, it cannot be added to the queue. Such messages are directly

discarded and the RRCConnectionReject message is sent to the UE.

RRC Connection Request Latency

The call queuing function is automatically enabled in case of cell overload. If the

overload condition ceases, the queued messages are pulled from the queue in the

following ways:

- At a fixed interval of 20 ms by default.
- At a frequency depending on the system MSR state, if the adaptive queue pulling is enabled.

The time a message spends in the queue is counted as additional latency in the RRC

connection setup.

# 4 Network Impact of Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load

The Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature improves the Accessibility KPI in

case of MSR overload.

Capacity and Performance

This feature improves the admission control process of the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature. It ensures additional protection of the system against overload due

to bursts of UE admission requests in short intervals.

This feature improves the Accessibility KPI. Capacity and Performance is improved in

the following way:

- UEs have a higher chance to be admitted by the system.
- The time needed for UEs to be admitted by the system is shortened. The RRCConnectionRequest messages are not rejected by the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature immediately. They do not have to wait for the t302 blocking period to expire, as at the following MSR update a reconnection attempt can be made.
- The call queuing function increases latency in the RRC connection setup phase. Pulling delay is added to the time that is needed for the RRC connection setup.

Interfaces

No Impact.

Other Network Elements

This feature requires ENM version 20.16 or later to operate.

When the Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load is activated, call rejections of

non-bandwidth reduced UEs by the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature are not valid

anymore. Messages subject to Dynamic UE Admission Control rejections are queued

instead. Therefore, the

EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrl and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrl counters are not

expected to be observed when the Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load feature is

activated.

Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load does not support Category M devices, meaning

that call rejections of bandwidth-reduced UEs by the Dynamic UE Admission Control

can still step the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrl
- EutranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrlCe
- EutranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrl
- EutranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabFailDynUeAdmCtrlCe

# 7 Activate Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012457 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012457 MO.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load

The call queuing function is disabled on a specific cell in the following cases:

- The values of the EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio and the EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio attributes are set to 0.
- The values of the EUtranCellFDD.dynUeAdmCtrlEnabled and the EUtranCellTDD.dynUeAdmCtrlEnabled attributes are set to false.
- The Dynamic UE Admission Control feature is deactivated.

If the queue is occupied and the Prioritized Call Queuing at High Load or Dynamic UE

Admission Control feature is deactivated, the existing messages in the queue are

processed, but no new requests are queued.

The EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio and the

EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio attributes define the ratio of

the Rrc.t300 timer value. Using these attributes, the maximum time is

defined that an RRCConnectionRequest message can spend in the queue. This

maximum time can be calculated in the following ways:

Maximum time in the queue =

EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio × Rrc.t300

Maximum time in the queue =

EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio × Rrc.t300

To reduce the number of the message time-outs in the queue, it is recommended to set the

following attributes to appropriate values:

- EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio
- EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueT300Ratio
- Rrc.t300

The EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueTo and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueTo counters are observed to see the

number of the message time-outs in the queue.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q2: High-Performance Queuing

This feature enhancement ensures Privileged Access (PA) call queuing and introduces

adaptive queue

pulling.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following functions:

- The PA connection requests are queued instead of being rejected by the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature in case of system overload. The RRCConnectionRequest messages of PA users are queued with the highest priority. Queuing function or rejection of the PA connection requests are only available if the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated. Without activating this feature, the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature always admits PA connection requests.

- Adaptive queue pulling is introduced. The frequency of pulling the RRCConnectionRequest messages from the queue is based on the system load instead of a fixed frequency. In case of higher load, less frequent pulling protects the system from overload. In case of lower load, the queue is emptied at faster rate.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The number of PA RRCConnectionRequest rejections is reduced if the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated.
- The accessibility of PA UEs is increased if the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated.
- The queued messages are processed based on the system state.
- Possible queue overload is avoided if the system is in stable state.
- The system is maintained in a stable state.
- The observability is improved for PA and mobile-originating voice users.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases the number of admitted connection requests. With

the adaptive queue pulling, the frequency of pulling the queued messages depends on

the system MSR state. In case of stable system state, the queue is emptied at faster

rate that helps avoiding possible queue overflow. In case of higher system load, the

message pulling is less frequent, to maintain the system in a stable state.

Operation

The feature enhancement is enabled by setting the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueAdaptivePulling and the

EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueAdaptivePulling attributes to

true.

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.rrcQueueAdaptivePulling
- EUtranCellTDD.rrcQueueAdaptivePulling

The feature enhancement adds the number of queued PA connection request messages to

the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueAtt and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueAtt counters.

The feature enhancement introduces the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueAttHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueAttHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueAttEm
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueAttEm
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueAttMoVoice
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueAttMoVoice
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueSuccHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueSuccHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueSuccEm
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueSuccEm
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueSuccMoVoice
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueSuccMoVoice
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnQueueAdptPullDelayDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnQueueAdptPullDelayDistr
