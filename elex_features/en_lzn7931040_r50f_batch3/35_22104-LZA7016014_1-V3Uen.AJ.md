# 1 Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity Overview

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature provides basic connected mode

mobility to a WCDMA network. When the feature is active, the UE can be directed to transfer from

the LTE network to the WCDMA network while maintaining the data session.

Summary

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature manages the redirection of UEs in

RRC\_CONNECTED mode to a WCDMA network when the UE measures poor

coverage in the current LTE frequency. Redirection is controlled by the network and

triggered by UE measurement reports of the serving LTE cell.

The feature provides system information about alternative WCDMA networks that can be used

by a UE in RRC\_IDLE mode for cell reselection.

If no session continuity feature is activated, the UE is configured not to trigger

measurements of poor coverage. Instead, the UE remains connected to the original frequency

within the LTE network with poor LTE coverage. If the UE is eventually released, it is

required to perform idle mode cell reselection to move to a WCDMA network. This interruption

time is long if the UE is connected to the LTE frequency with poor coverage for a long

period while a WCDMA network can provide better quality.

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature has the following benefits:

- Network capacity is enhanced by the possibility that the UE is served by the best available RAT.
- Service performance for an individual UE is enhanced by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available RAT.
- Session transition to a WCDMA network is possible with reduced interruptions to data flows during the transition process.
- Idle mode transition to a WCDMA network is facilitated by the transmission of SIB broadcast messages.
- Off-loading is possible by configuring coverage thresholds.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature redirects UEs to a WCDMA

network if the serving cell coverage becomes worse than the threshold and the WCDMA cell

coverage becomes good enough.

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature uses the A2 measurement

process. The A2 measurement is when the serving cell coverage becomes worse than the

threshold, as defined in the following standard specifications:

- 3GPP TS 36.300
- 3GPP TS 36.331

The UE uses the measurement parameters sent by the serving eNodeB for the measurement process

to evaluate the serving cell. These parameters sent to the UE in the

RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages include the following

information:

- Threshold values
- Hysteresis values
- Measurement filtering
- Time-to-trigger parameters

The time-to-trigger parameters are included in the evaluation to prevent redirection to a

WCDMA network based on a small number of measurements taken during a rapid fade in the

radio link. Hysteresis is used for protection against re-triggering A2 measurement and

triggering unnecessary UE measurement report transmissions.

The UE measurements are reported to the serving eNodeB to make the final decision on

redirection to a WCDMA network.

The A2 measurement can base its triggering criterion on the following measurements:

| RSRP   |    | Indicates the mean measured power per reference signal.                                                    |
|--------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        |    |                                                                                                            |
| RSRQ   |    | Indicates the reference signal quality, for example, high inter cell                         interference. |

The eNodeB configures two A2 measurements in the UE to detect poor coverage. One of

them is based on RSRP and one of them is based on RSRQ using the default settings. The

eNodeB considers a UE to be in poor coverage when at least one of the measurements

report poor coverage.

The eNodeB determines whether to release the UE with a redirection to a WCDMA network based

on the following criteria:

- UE capabilities
- eNodeB licenses
- Redirection priority

If the UE is released with a redirection to a WCDMA network, the release message contains

the UMTS ARFCN to help the UE find a suitable WCDMA cell.

To understand how these interact when several or all of theses features are operational,

the description here covers all of them.

Figure 1   How and Where to Transfer the UE at Poor Coverage

Operational process:

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB determines a set of frequencies for LTE or IRAT, where the UE is transferred when it encounters poor coverage in the current cell.
    1. The eNodeB searches all frequency relations in the following MO instances for the corresponding RAT: Frequency Relation MO Corresponding RAT EUtranFreqRelation LTE GeranFreqGroupRelation GERAN UtranFreqRelation WCDMA Cdma2000FreqBandRelation CDMA-eHRPD UtranTDDFreqRelation TD-SCDMA The following criteria has to be fulfilled for the eNodeB to find a frequency relation:
        - The corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is active and enabled. The corresponding frequency relation MO instance is included only, if the corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is activated and enabled.
        - The frequency of the serving cell is not represented, so the EUtranFreqRelation for the frequency of the serving cell is not included.
        - The UE is capable to operate on the frequency.
        - If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
        - If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.
    2. Construct the following two sets from the set found at step 2.a: A set where all frequency relations with the attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio set to -1 are excluded. A set where all frequency relations with the attribute voicePrio set to -1 are excluded.
3. If coverage provided by the serving cell drops below the parameter-defined threshold for poor coverage, the UE is configured to send an A2 measurement report, if at least one of the sets of frequencies found is not empty.
4. If the UE encounters poor coverage, the A2 measurement is triggered in the UE and it sends a measurement report to the eNodeB. The eNodeB selects the candidate frequency relations with the highest priority from the set of frequencies found at step 2.a. The priorities are determined using priority attributes on the frequency relation MOs: If the UE has an active voice bearer (with QCI 1) The attribute voicePrio is used. Frequency relation MOs which does not have this attribute are ignored. If the UE has no active voice bearer (with QCI 1) The attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio is used. If the selected priority attribute has a -1 value All frequency relations are omitted. Several frequency relation MOs share the highest value for these attributes They are all selected. The set is empty because no frequency relation is selected The eNodeB continues to wait for another A2 measurement report from the UE.
5. The eNodeB first checks if a blind handover to a predefined cell is possible. This is enabled by the following handover features: Note: Only cells using a candidate frequency found at step 4 are considered for blind handover.
    - SRVCC Handover to GERAN
    - SRVCC Handover to UTRAN
    - Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover
    - Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
6. Measurements are started if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute is true and the candidate frequencies selected at step 4 contain at least one frequency which can be measured. A frequency can be measured, if the following criteria are fulfilled:
    - The UE supports measurements on the frequency.
    - The eNodeB supports measurements on the frequency. Note: The eNodeB supports measurements on all LTE and GERAN frequencies. The eNodeB supports measurements on WCDMA, CDMA-eHRPD, and TD-SCDMA (TDD only) frequencies only, if there are configured cells for these frequencies with the MO instances of UtranCellRelation and Cdma2000CellRelation.
7. If measurements are not started, and the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 or the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is true, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to one of the selected frequencies. These are all on the same priority level, so the eNodeB can pick any one of them. It is unspecified which one the eNodeB picks, but given the same selection of frequencies, the eNodeB always picks the same frequency. If measurements are not started, but the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, and the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is false, the eNodeB waits for another A2 measurement report.
8. If measurements are started, the eNodeB starts A5 measurement or A3 measurements for LTE frequencies and B2 measurements for IRAT frequencies to detect the candidate frequencies selected at step 4 that can be measured as described in step 6. The eNodeB also starts A1 measurements to detect if the UE moves into good coverage again. At the same time the eNodeB starts the timer UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer.
9. If an A1 measurement report arrives from the UE, the eNodeB stops the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement and A1 measurements in the UE, and waits for another A2 measurement report.
10. If the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer times out and the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 (indicating a voice bearer), or the value of the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is true, the eNodeB releases the UE with a redirection to one of the frequencies for which A5 measurement, A3 measurement, or B2 measurements starts at step 8. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, the eNodeB restarts the timer and waits for another measurement report for the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement, or A1 measurement.
11. An A5 measurement report, A3 measurement report, or B2 measurement report arrives from the UE for one of the frequencies
12. The eNodeB first checks if a handover is possible to one of the reported cells. This is enabled by separate handover features.
13. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 (indicating a voice bearer), or the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is true, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to the frequency of the measurement report. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, and the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is false, the eNodeB waits for another measurement report for the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement, or A1 measurement.

## 3.2 Measurement Configuration

B2 Measurement

A B2 measurement is when the serving cell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 and the

neighbor cell becomes better than another absolute threshold2. B2 measurement is the

measurement criterion for finding suitable alternative WCDMA frequencies.

All WCDMA frequencies selected by the frequency selection algorithm uses the

same configuration for the B2 measurement.

A1 Measurement

A1 measurement is the measurement criterion for detecting that the UE moves out of poor

coverage and no longer has to be transferred to a new frequency. The eNodeB configures two

A1 measurement measurements in the UE, and these have to correspond to the two A2

measurements for poor coverage. The parameters of the ReportConfigA1Prim

and ReportConfigA1Sec MO are used for the configuration of A1

measurements.

A2 Measurement

The poor coverage evaluation can use primary and secondary measurement parameters to allow

the UE to use different settings for two simultaneous measurements for A2 measurement. Primary

measurements use RSRP and secondary measurements use RSRQ as the measurement quantity by

default. Both primary and secondary measurements can use the same measurement quantity.

Measurement configuration information is sent to the UE in the

RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages. A new version of the message is

sent to the UE whenever the parameters are updated. This can occur when the UE completes a

handover to an LTE cell with different parameter settings.

Having two measurement thresholds for poor coverage evaluation allows the use of different

hysteresis and timer values for the different threshold values.

The process for evaluation using the secondary parameters and threshold is similar, but

different parameter values can be used. For example, the

ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Prim can be set to trigger

on RSRP measurements with a ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim

value of 1 dB and the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovSec.triggerQuantityA2Sec can

be set to trigger on RSRQ measurements with a

ReportConfigEUtraBadCovSec.hysteresisA2Sec value of 2 dB.

Figure 2   Poor Coverage Evaluation Process Using Primary Threshold

The UE uses parameters sent by the eNodeB to determine when to perform measurements.

Measurements begin on the neighboring cells when the RSRP of the serving cell falls below

the value defined in the UeMeasControl.sMeasure parameter. The parameter

is also the trigger value for measurements used in intra-LTE handover.

The following describes the evaluation process for the primary trigger. The process for the

secondary trigger is identical and occurs in parallel with the primary process as

follows:

1. The ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Prim parameter determines whether RSRP or RSRQ values trigger A2 measurement for the primary criterion. If the primary trigger quantity is set to RSRP, the threshold value set in ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim is sent to the UE. Otherwise, the RSRQ threshold value set in ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim is sent.
2. The measured values of RSRP and RSRQ are filtered based on the settings of the UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrp and UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrq parameters. The filter averages a number of measurements to remove the impact of fast fading. The filter values are also used by the UE in the intra-LTE handover measurement process.
3. The UE applies the hysteresis value of ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim to determine whether to trigger the A2 measurement.
4. When A2 measurement is triggered, the UE waits the time predetermined in ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.timeToTriggerA2Prim before it begins sending measurement reports to the serving eNodeB. The reports contain measurements for the serving cell.
5. Measurement reports are sent to the eNodeB periodically while the A2 measurement condition is fulfilled. The time interval between measurement reports is 480 ms.

The formula used by the UE for evaluating entry to A2 measurements is shown in the

following equation:

| Ms                 |    | The measured value of the serving cell (either RSRP or RSRQ).                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| a2ThresholdPrimary |    | The value of ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim or                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim depending on               whether the trigger quantity is RSRP or RSRQ. |

The UE uses the same hysteresis value to determine when to leave A2 measurement once the serving

cell improves in RSRP or RSRQ relative to the neighboring cells. The formula used by the UE

is shown in the following equation:

| Ms                 |    | Measured value of the serving cell (either RSRP or RSRQ)                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| a2ThresholdPrimary |    | The value of ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim or                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim depending on               whether the trigger quantity is RSRP or RSRQ. |

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature provides mobility for UEs to

WCDMA networks if the LTE coverage becomes bad. This increases the available coverage for

UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature enhances network capacity by

improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available frequency within the

network.

It is possible to configure this feature in such a way that an off-loading effect is

achieved, where UEs are transferred from the LTE frequency to a WCDMA frequency. This can be

used to avoid overload and improve the overall network capacity.

The feature has no impact on the physical cell coverage, but offloading UEs to alternative

frequencies indirectly means that the coverage is improved. Activating the feature and

setting the threshold for poor coverage puts limits on the range of UE in the LTE

network.

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature decreases the time needed for the

UE to make connected mode transitions to a WCDMA network.

If the feature is not activated, the UE loses LTE coverage completely before attempting to

attach to a WCDMA network.

Interfaces

The feature introduces the SIB6 IE.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature needs to be configured for

optimal operation.

Configure Redirection of the UEs at Poor Coverage

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity feature requires no direct

connections between the LTE network and the WCDMA network. To configure redirection

of the UE at poor coverage, information about WCDMA carrier frequencies must be

entered in the eNodeB during network configuration. The carrier frequency

information is sent to the UE during the redirection process to assist the UE in

finding the WCDMA frequency. A UtranFreqRelation and a

corresponding UtranFrequency MO must be created for each UTRAN

frequency where the UE needs to redirected.

For each of the following frequency relation MO attributes a value corresponding to

its priority relative to other frequency relations needs to be assigned:

- Cdma2000FreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation.voicePrio
- EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio
- UtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- UtranFreqRelation.voicePrio
- GeranFreqGroupRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- GeranFreqGroupRelation.voicePrio

This is used when determining where to redirect the UE in case of poor coverage.

Configure A1 Measurement and A2 Measurement

Configure A1 measurement and A2 measurement for optimal operation of the feature.

Measurement in the UE

When a UE reports poor coverage, the eNodeB can directly transfer the UE to one of

the candidate frequencies or it can configure a new measurement in the UE to detect

possible frequencies before the UE is transferred. If the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive parameter is set to

true, a measurement is configured in the UE to help detect

frequencies where the UE can be transferred. If it is false, the UE

is directly transferred to the new frequency without a new measurement.

Configure SIB6 Broadcast

To configure a cell to broadcast SIB6, which contains information and parameters

required by the UE to perform idle mode reselection to the WCDMA network,

UtranFreqRelation MOs must be added as children of the

EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD MO

representing the cell. Map SIB6 to an SI message as specified in Manage Radio Network and Manage Mobility for SIB6 to be broadcast.
