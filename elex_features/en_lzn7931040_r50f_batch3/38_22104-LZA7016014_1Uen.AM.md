# 1 SRVCC Handover to UTRAN Overview

The feature enables the eNodeB to use handover to transfer UEs with voice bearers from

LTE to WCDMA. The voice bearers are handed over to the Circuit Switched (CS) domain.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |

Summary

This feature is closely related to the Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature. The

two features provide support for handover to a WCDMA cell. Depending on the activated

feature, the following differences apply:

- With the SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature, only voice bearers are included in the handover. The voice bearers are handed over to the CS domain.
- With the Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature, all bearers are included in the handover. The bearers are handed over to the PS domain.
- When the two features are enabled at the same time, the voice bearers are handed over to the CS domain. The PS bearers also included in the handover end up in the PS domain.

It is possible that the UE PS bearers are not transferred to the WCDMA target cell in the

handover that transfers the voice bearers. In this case, the PS bearers can be reestablished

in the target cell.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Enhanced control over how UEs with voice bearers are transferred between frequencies and cells.
- LTE VoIP session transition to the CS domain in a WCDMA cell when poor coverage is detected in the serving cell.
- Using handover to transfer the UE enables the target node to use different admission criteria than at a plain connection setup. This improves the probability that a service, for example VoIP, is not interrupted in a network with high load.

# 2 Dependencies of SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

The feature requires at least one of three other features to be active and it is

related to other features. The feature requires support from the MME, the UEs in the

network, and neighbor WCDMA systems.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The network must have UEs with the capability to do SRVCC Handover to WCDMA. This is indicated by FGI bit 27 as described in 3GPP TS 36.331.
- The MME must support SRVCC. The MME indicates this in the SRVCC operation possible IE in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST S1 message or in the HANDOVER REQUEST S1/X2 message. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.413 and 3GPP TS 36.423.
- At least one neighbor WCDMA system must support the SRVCC procedure.

# 3 Feature Operation of SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

The feature provides enhanced active mode mobility between LTE and WCDMA cells in the

operator network when the UE has voice bearers. The SRVCC handover can be achieved as a PS

handover, as an SRVCC handover, or a combined SRVCC and PS handover.

SRVCC Handover

When the SRVCC handover procedure is started, an indication is included that SRVCC must be

used. The indication informs the MME that the UE voice bearers must be transferred to the CS

domain in the target cell. When a UTRAN cell is selected for SRVCC handover, it is

explicitly checked for SRVCC capability.

The eNodeB does not initiate an RwR for a UE that has voice bearers. If no appropriate

target cell is found where the UE can be handed over, the UE is kept in the serving cell.

The UE stays in the serving cell until new measurement reports are processed and targets for

handover can be

found.

If no SRVCC feature is enabled, it is possible to override this behavior using the

UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute.

If all UE voice bearers are accepted and established in the target cell, the SRVCC handover

is considered successful. This is the case even if some PS bearers cannot be

transferred.

Handover Requirements

The PS handover can be achieved using the feature Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover,

which is not always triggered by poor coverage. The SRVCC handover can be achieved using the

SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature.

The following requirements are applicable to SRVCC handovers:

- The UtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER.
- The UE has at least one voice bearer that is a bearer with QCI 1. Note: In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.216, the MME only considers bearers with QCI=1 as voice bearers. The SRVCC procedure cannot be applied to a bearer with a QCI value (other than QCI=1) that correspond to a voice profile. Only bearers with QCI=1 are transferred to the CS domain of the target when the SRVCC procedure is applied for a UE.
- The UE capabilities support SRVCC.
- The MME associated with the UE supports SRVCC.
- The selected UTRAN cell supports SRVCC. This is configured in the ExternalUtranCellFDD.srvccCapability attribute.
- The SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature is OPERABLE.

A combined handover is possible if the following requirements are fulfilled besides the

requirements for the SRVCC handover:

- The UE has at least one additional bearer where the ServiceType attribute is set to other than IMS\_SIGNALING or MC\_SIGNALING values.
- The target cell is capable of CS and PS handover. This is indicated by the ExternalUtranCellFDD.srvccCapability attribute of the target cell set to PS\_AND\_CS\_SUPPORTED.
- The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature is OPERABLE.

Handover Method Selection

The eNodeB selects the handover method based on the conditions.

# 4 Network Impact of SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

The feature improves network capacity in poor coverage.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhances the

network capacity by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the

best available frequency or cell in the network.

The feature has no impact on performance. This is because no alternative feature or

solution that enables transferring UEs with voice bearers from an LTE cell to a WCDMA cell

is available for comparison.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for SRVCC Handover to UTRAN

The feature provides enhanced active mode mobility between LTE and WCDMA cells in the

operator network when the UE has voice bearers. Correct configuration is required to ensure

successful SRVCC handover.

When the feature is active, a UE with voice bearers can be directed to do an SRVCC

handover to a WCDMA cell while maintaining the voice session. Under conditions,

maintaining the data sessions is also possible.

Correct configuration of the feature is required to ensure the following results:

- The UE is transferred to a WCDMA cell that can support the UE voice session in the CS domain. The UE must have coverage for this WCDMA cell.
- A B2 measurement is configured in the UE when several candidate target cells that do not cover the source cell completely are available.
- When at least one SRVCC-capable target cell that covers the source cell completely is available, the UE performs the SRVCC handover directly, without a B2 measurement.

## 9.1 Configuration for Blind and Measurement-Based SRVCC Handover to WCDMA

The operations needed to configure an eNodeB for blind and measurement-based SRVCC

handover to UTRAN are the same as the operations required for configuring a WCDMA handover. For

SRVCC handovers, the difference is that no RwR is performed for a UE with voice

bearers.

Configuration for Blind SRVCC Handover

To indicate that blind SRVCC handover can be used for the WCDMA target frequency, the

following configuration must be fulfilled in the eNodeB:

- The EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute must be set to TRUE in the serving cell.
- The UtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute must have the value HANDOVER.
- Under the UtranFreqRelation MO, a UtranCellRelation MO instance must exist where the attributes are set the following way: The UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to COVERS. This indicates that the target cell covers the serving cell completely and that it is safe to send the UE without measuring. The UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to TRUE. The available member of the UtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to TRUE. This cell relation represents the target cell in the resulting blind handover.

Configuration for Measurement-Based SRVCC Handover

To indicate that measurement-based SRVCC handover can be used for the WCDMA target

frequency, the following configuration must be fulfilled in the eNodeB:

- If the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is active, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN attribute must be set to true. Otherwise, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute must be set to true.
- The UtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute must have the value HANDOVER.
- For every candidate target cell, a UtranCellRelation MO instance where the UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true must exist under the UtranFreqRelation MO.

## 9.2 Configuration for SRVCC Handover to WCDMA

For successful SRVCC handover, target cell attributes related to SRVCC handover must be

configured correctly.

The following parameters of the candidate cell MO instance

must be set to values different than the default value:

| lac   |    | Location Area Code.  Must be sent to the MME to identify the target SGSN that serves the                             target WCDMA RNC.                               |
|-------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       |    |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| rac   |    | Routing Area Code.  Must be sent to the MME to be able to identify the target SGSN in the                             target location area of the target WCDMA cell. |

For an ExternalUtranCellFDD MO instance, it is recommended to

set the ExternalUtranCellFDD.lac and the

ExternalUtranCellFDD.rac attributes at the creation of the MO

instance.

The ExternalUtranCellFDD.rac attribute needs to be set only if the

following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature is active in the eNodeB.
- The ExternalUtranCellFDD.srvccCapability attribute in the target cell is set to PS\_AND\_CS\_SUPPORTED.

The Location Area Code of the target cell MO must be configured in the same way as for the

Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature.

No PS handover is performed for data bearers if the

ExternalUtranCellFDD.srvccCapability attribute is set to

CS\_ONLY\_SUPPORTED or the Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature is

inoperable.

## 9.3 Configuration of Shared RAN Mobility to WCDMA MOCN

The shared RAN mobility to WCDMA function must be enabled for UEs using additional

PLMNs in MOCN configurations.

Enabling Shared RAN mobility to WCDMA MOCN makes IRAT handover possible, where the UE

does not handle the primary PLMN of the WCDMA cell, only an additional PLMN.

This function can be enabled by setting the

ENodeBFunction.hoSrvccToWcdmaMocnEnabled attribute to

true. The function is disabled by default.

When the function is enabled, PSHO and SRVCC handover are allowed, if the target UTRAN

cell and the HRL of the UE both contain a PLMN which is included in the

UtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute.

If the UtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute is empty, PSHO and

SRVCC handover are allowed for UEs belonging to any PLMN.
