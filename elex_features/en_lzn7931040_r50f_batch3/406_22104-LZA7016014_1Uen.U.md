Summary

With the feature, the operator can reduce the cell TX power to a configured power ratio

without the need to lock or unlock the cell. When the feature is triggered, the cell

TX power is reduced gradually to minimize the traffic disturbance.

This feature provides the function to reduce cell TX power flexibly and softly.

This feature supports FDD only.

# 2 Dependencies of Soft Reduction of Cell Tx Power

The feature has dependencies with other features related to the time it takes effect,

and to the compensation of the UE PUSCH power.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

ENM 18.3 or higher is required to support the configuration parameters.

# 3 Feature Operation of Soft Reduction of Cell Tx Power

Setting the EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio attribute changes the cell TX

power without the need to lock or unlock the cell.

If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio is changed, the cell TX

power starts changing gradually The change happens at the rate of

EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerChangeRate, until it reaches the target. The

change is applied to all downlink physical signals and channels in the LTE cell.

During the power change, changing the value of

EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio is rejected by the cell. When the

power change is done, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerRatio

attribute can be changed.

The power state is indicated by the EUtranCellFDD.dlPowerState with

the following states:

- INVALID
- STABLE
- CHANGING

# 4 Network Impact of Soft Reduction of Cell Tx Power

The feature affects the network performance, because cell coverage shrinks with a

reduced cell TX power.

Capacity and Performance

Cell TX power and cell coverage are fundamental to wireless services. The reduction

of cell TX power leads to the reduction of cell coverage, which has affects on the

network performance. The degree of impact depends on the cell TX power reduction and

the amount of traffic in the cell border area.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Soft Reduction of Cell Tx Power

The feature introduces parameters for changing the cell TX power without locking and

unlocking the cell.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                       | Type       | Description          |
