Summary

The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature uses a search zone along the edge of the cell,

where UE measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells.

With

the Machine Intelligence Enabled

Mobility

feature, this search is limited to frequencies that a UE is

likely to accept as target for handover. This is achieved by predicting the

frequency coverage based on a model for the coverage of frequencies. The model is

built on data collected through UE measurements.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Faster inter-frequency handover
- On average, UEs spend less time in poor coverage
- Improved selection of target frequency for inter-frequency handover
- Possibility to reuse the same configuration for each defined EUtranFreqRelations MO
- Connected mode mobility priority over the entire network
- Combines configured priority with predicted coverage

Hardware

Supported only on Baseband units.

Limitations

Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility only works for the E-UTRAN frequencies.

To benefit from the Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility feature the

TriggerQuantity must be set to RSRP for

inter-frequency measurement.

# 3 Feature Operation of Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

The feature builds and maintains a model for frequency coverage using data collected

from inactive UEs in the

cell.

The model is used to find the best target frequency for a UE at handover in poor coverage.

If the Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility feature is used, the selection of target

frequency for Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is optimized using a

machine

intelligence-created

model reflecting

frequency

coverage.

The data collection for model creation and the optimization of target

frequency selection procedures are applied when a UE enters into the search zone

modified by Machine Intelligence Enabled

Mobility. The

modified search zone is based on the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

configuration.

The

time needed for a model to be created depends on the number of UEs using Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage in that area. The model is continuously validated against

actual radio conditions and is rebuilt if the radio conditions are

changed.

Figure 1   Main Flow

The data collection starts at activation of Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility. When

enough data is collected to build a model, the model is trained and validated with

respect to collected data. If the model is judged to perform well, it is used to

optimize the search for target frequencies. Otherwise, Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

legacy is used until more data is collected.

## 3.1 Search Zone Modified by Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

The Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility feature modifies the search zone-introduced

at cell edge by Mobility Control at Poor Coverage-by adding a modified

threshold.

Due to this, related counters are slightly affected during model training phase, after which

(while IRAT mobility is decreased) there is an increase of inter-frequency

mobility.

When a UE attaches to a cell, A5 measurements are configured in the UE to detect that the

UE has entered the modified search zone. This is valid for all UEs in RRC-CONNECTED

state. The A5 measurement is used so that the UEs measure frequencies different from the

frequency of the serving cell. This is in order to create input for the Machine

Intelligence Enabled Mobility feature. The A5 measurement is configured as the A2

measurement for the search zone in Mobility Control at Poor Coverage, but with a value

of 1 dB higher, in order to have the preferable case when A5 is triggered before A2.

Search zone can be entered either by A2 measurement or by A5 measurement. If there are no

neighboring cells on the same frequency, A2 measurement triggers and is used as input to

the Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility feature.

Figure 2   Modified Search Zone

The value of the attribute ReportConfigSearch.inhibitA2SearchConfig

applies also to the A5 measurements. Depending on the value of

ReportConfigSearch.inhibitA2SearchConfig, one or two measurements

are configured, using RSRP or RSRQ or one of each as triggering quantities. The A5

measurement Threshold2 is set to minimal value.

The A2 measurements are also configured using the unmodified search threshold value. When

the A2 measurement is triggered it is treated as the UE entered the modified search

zone.

To detect when the UE leaves the modified search zone and enters into good coverage

again, corresponding A1 measurements are configured with the same threshold value as the

A5 measurements (A2 + 1 dB).

## 3.2 Model Life Cycle of Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

The collected "Machine Intelligence Input" is used to generate a machine intelligence

model for predictions for the relation between each source cell (F1) and respective

neighbor LTE frequency (F2 and F3). The "Machine Intelligence Input" comes from the

border where the UE crosses into the modified search zone.

Figure 3   Model Life Cycle

The "Machine Intelligence Input" can be collected at two intensities:

- High intensity during the model creation
- Low intensity when the model is created

The time needed for a model to be created depends on the number of UEs using the Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage in that area. The minimum collection period is spread out

during the day in order to capture UE activities in that time frame. However, the

collection takes longer time if the UE activity is low. As such, temporary changes in

the radio conditions have minor impact on the general feature behavior during low

collection intensity of "Machine Intelligence Input".

A created model is continuously validated against actual radio conditions, and is rebuilt

(or removed) if the radio conditions are changed. The removal of a model happens if the

"Machine Intelligence Input" does not allow a successful model rebuild, in which case

the "Machine Intelligence Input" intensity reverts to high.

## 3.3 Data Collection of Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

Figure 4   Data Collection for Machine Intelligence Model

1. An A2 measurement or an A5 measurement is triggered in the UE. The UE sends a measurement report to the node indicating that the UE enters the modified search zone for this triggering quantity.
2. It is checked if the UE is inactive. A UE is inactive if it is in RRC-CONNECTED state, but is not sending or receiving any data.
3. If the UE is inactive, the UE is selected to perform "Machine Intelligence Input" measurement. The measurement is started if there is a E-UTRAN frequency that is waiting to be measured. Each UE only measures a single frequency. However, for different UEs the measurements are distributed over all E-UTRAN frequencies for which the cell has a EUtranFreqRelation MO instance. The frequency of the serving cell is not measured. The intensity of the measurements is done on a higher intensity level during the machine intelligence model creation phase. The intensity is lowered to a minimum after the model is created.
4. The "Machine Intelligence Input" measurement is started in the UE as a periodical measurement, where the purpose is set to reportStrongestCells, as described in 3GPP TS 36.331.
5. When the node receives a report for the "Machine Intelligence Input" measurement, the report is processed and used as input to the machine intelligence model. A handover to the strongest cell is performed directly if the reported signal strength is good enough.
6. If the UE goes active-starting data transmission-the "Machine Intelligence Input" measurement is stopped.
7. If the UE leaves the modified search zone, the "Machine Intelligence Input" measurement is stopped. The UE is handled by the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature.

## 3.4 Optimization of Search Target Frequencies of Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

Figure 5   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The UE either enters the modified search zone or the inner search zone for Mobility Control at Poor Coverage configuration using two search zones.
2. It is checked if a model is available to apply Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility. If not, the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature operation is continued unchanged.
3. The machine intelligence model is used to optimize "Target Good Enough" measurement. This is done by identifying a list of E-UTRAN frequencies that the UE accepts as handover target. If there is no cell relation between source cell and target cell for a particular frequency, that frequency is omitted and not measured upon. A potential target frequency is not used as a target if the mobility criteria, affected by Service Triggered Mobility, is not met.Note: All configured frequencies are potential targets and can be selected.
    1. If the machine intelligence model can predict coverage with high probability, a single frequency is proposed. If more than one frequency meets the model criteria, the configured priority in Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is used to select one frequency. IRAT frequencies with higher connectedModeMobilityPrio than selected frequency is included. Frequencies are prioritized as for the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature.
    2. If a single frequency cannot be proposed, the model excludes frequencies for which the model can predict non-coverage with high probability.
    3. If no frequency can be excluded, Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is applied unchanged.
    1. A timer is started if the "Target Good Enough" measurement is optimized. The timer ensures that the UE is given enough time to measure on other frequencies. This secures fallback to Mobility Control at Poor Coverage, if the model-based predictions are not correct and the timer times out.
    2. If the MI timer times out, "Target Good Enough" measurements are reset to Mobility Control at Poor Coverage search.Note: There is a fallback to legacy Mobility Control at Poor Coverage if the UE passes the outer search zone.
5. The sequence of Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is applied with an optimized list of frequencies for the "Target Good Enough" measurement. For more information, see Mobility Control at Poor Coverage.

# 4 Network Impact of Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

The feature improves retainability for active UEs

through

faster

frequency selection for

mobility.

Capacity and Performance

On average,

UEs

spend less time in poor coverage. This results in decreased uplink interference,

increased throughput, as well as a positive impact on retainability.

Some inactive UEs are selected to collect necessary "Machine Intelligence Input" by

performing one extra measurement. These extra measurements are spread out over

inactive UEs over time, this way reducing the impact on each individual UE. However,

the retainability might be impacted slightly negatively when collecting "Machine

Intelligence Input". The number of UEs selected for "Machine Intelligence Input" is

decreased when the machine intelligence model is created. When the model is created,

it is used to optimize target frequency selection for UEs entering poor

coverage.

The feature selects a better frequency by combining the configured priority with

predicted coverage. It is robust to network changes and adapts automatically. This

means that the same configuration of

EUtranFreqRelations

can be used in the entire network, since the feature detects where the frequencies

are deployed.

The event flow following from frequency coverage model creation, model access, and

predictions adds signaling and processing load. This has no negative impact on any

KPIs.

The following changes happen due to increased search zone:

- The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage related counters are slightly affected during model training phase.
- After the training phase, IRAT mobility is slightly decreased, and inter-frequency mobility is increased.

Introduction of the

load

module

process increases the following:

- Upgrade package size
- Startup time
- Memory consumption

This feature limits its use of memory so that the node is protected from memory exhaustion.

Interfaces

No impact.

# 7 Activate Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012297 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012297 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

The feature uses manually configured connected mode mobility priorities, but those do

not need to be revised.

The ReportConfigA5.a5Threshold1Rsrp parameter can be set equal to the

respective Machine Intelligence Mobility Search Threshold. The Machine Intelligence

Mobility Search Threshold value is 1 dBm higher than the respective A2 measurement RSRP

threshold value.

This setting improves the probability of receiving A5 measurement before the Machine

Intelligence timer expires, because it does not require the signal to fall even lower

than the Machine Intelligence Mobility Search Threshold to satisfy the A5 Threshold

1.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q2: Enhanced Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility

The

feature enhancement adds support to all Baseband hardware, and allows the model to be kept

after restart or cell lock or unlock.

| Feature Name:           | Machine Intelligence Enabled Mobility   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4940                            |
| Value Package Name:     | Self-Organizing Networks                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0435                            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                     |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

During data collection, Report Strongest Cell measurements are made. If a valid handover

target is detected from these measurements, a handover to that target is attempted.

When a model diverges from its wanted behavior, the RBS detects the change within a few

hours and puts the model on hold. This lasts until either the model performs correctly

again, or is retrained for the new network deployment.

The RBS does not use a frequency when Service Triggered Mobility is configured so that

the UE does not use the predicted frequency.

Capacity and Performance

Memory usage is limited to support all Baseband hardware.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduced the following new counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCriticalBorderEvalReportAct
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCriticalBorderEvalReportAct
- EUtranCellFDD.pmBadCovMiMultiFreqSel
