# 1 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining Overview

In groups of 4 RX antennas, the 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining feature can

suppress more interference than full IRC in groups of 2 RX antennas. This leads to an

improved network performance.

Summary

The 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining (4x4 Full IRC) feature improves PUSCH receiver

performance in uplink interference limited environment when four or more receive

antennas are used. The principle of operation of this feature is similar to that of

the Interference Rejection Combining feature. However,

because it uses correlation information between higher number of receive antennas,

it can suppress more interfering signals from other cells or in-band external

interference. This increases average uplink UE throughput and uplink cell throughput

compared to IRC when there are multiple uplink interferers present.

The use of 4x4 Full IRC does not require any additional UE support.

This licensed feature supports both TDD and FDD.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining

As shown in Figure 1, the 4x4 Full Interference

Rejection Combining (4x4 Full IRC) feature combines the PUSCH signal from receive

antennas in a more optimal way compared to MRC and IRC when there is more than one

interferer.

When the feature is enabled, the RBS decides to use 4x4 Full IRC based on the number of

receive antennas and received interference level. 4x4 Full IRC is used when four or more

receive antennas are used. For two receive antennas,IRC is used. The RBS uses

information about interference from receive antennas to decide whether 4x4 Full IRC or

MRC is used for more optimal signal combining.

# 4 Network Impact of 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining

The 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining feature can increase uplink throughput and

has no impact on interfaces and other network elements.

significant interference level (number of interferers) is observed.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

# 5 Parameters for 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining

The 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining does not introduce any new

parameters.

Parameters

This feature does not introduce new parameters.

# 6 Performance of 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining

The 4x4 Full Interference Rejection Combining feature increases the uplink and the mean

uplink throughput, and affects SINR and uplink throughput counters. Because of SINR

improvement a slight increase in the detected PUSCH transmissions and a slight decrease in

the UL QPSK DTX rate is expected.

KPIs

The table lists the main KPIs associated with the feature and the expected

impact.

Table 2   Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                    | Description                                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Uplink Throughput      | The KPI is increased in interference limited scenarios. |
| Mean Uplink Throughput | The KPI is increased in interference limited scenarios. |

Counters

If the feature is enabled, SINR is distributed to higher value bins in interference

limited scenarios with the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSinrPuschDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmSinrPuschDistr

Higher value for the detected PUSCH transmission counters is expected:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUlGrantsWithDetectedPusch
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUlGrantsWithDetectedPusch

At the same time, the lower value for the QPSK DTX counters is expected:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmMacHarqUlDtxQpsk
- EUtranCellTDD.pmMacHarqUlDtxQpsk

If the feature is enabled,

uplink

throughput is distributed to higher value bins in interference limited scenarios

with the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpUlDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpUlDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThp2UlDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThp2UlDistr

The pmSinrPuschDistr PM counter is distributed to higher value

bins in interference limited scenarios. The distribution results in higher number of

bits per PRB. The number of bits per PRB is calculated with the following

equation:

pmPdcpVolUlDrb * 1000 / pmPrbUsedUlDtch

Higher UE uplink throughput is also reflected in the distribution of

pmUeThpUlDistr and pmUeThp2UlDistr

counters to higher value bins and increased values for uplink throughput KPIs. These

values are evaluated for each average interference level calculated from the

pmRadioRecInterferencePwr counter. The analyzed values are

improved for higher interference levels compared to results where the feature is not

active.
