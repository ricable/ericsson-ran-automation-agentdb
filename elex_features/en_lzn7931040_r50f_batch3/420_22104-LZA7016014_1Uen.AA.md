# 1 Inter-Vendor Load Balancing Overview

The Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature enables traffic load balancing between nodes of

different vendors. Without it, traffic load balancing is possible only between Ericsson

nodes.

Summary

For the full use of different frequencies, the traffic load balancing solution is implemented

to achieve traffic load distribution between cells. For the proper distribution of

load between cells, information must be exchanged between the involved cells. The

legacy solution can work only between two Ericsson nodes.

The Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature provides traffic load balancing between Ericsson nodes

and nodes of other vendors. The node of other vendor must implement inter-vendor

load balancing from the side of the other vendor. The node of other vendor must

support the Resource Status Reporting procedure.

Inter-vendor load balancing is usable if nodes of other vendors have activated

traffic load balancing, and the 3GPP Resource Status Reporting interface is

implemented. If there is a network consisting of Ericsson nodes and nodes of other

vendors, the feature provides better distributed traffic load between frequencies

served by mixed nodes.

The non-Ericsson node or the Ericsson node initiates load distribution actions based on the

measurement results.

The X2AP interface is modified, new procedures and messages are added.

# 2 Dependencies of Inter-Vendor Load Balancing

The Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature uses the traffic load balancing algorithms of

the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

feature.

between the nodes.

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-Vendor Load Balancing

The Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature provides a traffic load balancing solution that

works between eNodeBs from different

vendors.

To use the Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature, the eNodeB must be capable of the

following processes:

- To send requests for traffic load data in the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message of the X2 interface.
- To receive requests for traffic load data in the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message of the X2 interface.
- To send the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message.
- To answer the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message with either the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_RESPONSE, or the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_FAILURE message.
- To receive traffic load data report in the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message over the X2 interface.
- To report traffic load data by sending RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message over the X2 interface.

The following messages are involved in the process:

- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST
- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_RESPONSE
- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_FAILURE
- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE

The Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature operation consists of the following processes in

the given order:

1. The Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure is used by the Ericsson eNodeB or the external eNodeB to request the reporting of load measurements from the other eNodeB.
2. The Resource Status Reporting procedure is initiated by the non-Ericsson node or the Ericsson eNodeB for reporting the measurement results admitted by the Ericsson eNodeB or the non-Ericsson node.

## 3.1 3GPP X2 Interface - Resource Status Reporting Initiation

The Ericsson eNodeB or the external eNodeB that wants to request measurements uses

the initiation report procedure to request the reporting of load measurements.

The initiation report procedure involves the following messages:

- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST
- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_RESPONSE
- RESOURCE\_STATUS\_FAILURE

The procedure is initiated by the eNodeB1 that sends a

RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message to the eNodeB2.

Figure 1   Resource Status Reporting Initiation

For successful operation, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- To receive the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message from the Ericsson node, the non-Ericsson node must request at least one of the two PRB Periodic and Composite Available Capacity measurements. Partial Success Indicator must be present if additional measurements are requested. Otherwise, the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_FAILURE is sent and inter-vendor load balancing is not performed.
- It must be possible to request measurements for all cells indicated in the Cell To Report IE, included in the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message.
- No cell is already included in the existing measurement session requested by the eNodeB that initiated the ongoing procedure.
- If the Partial Success Indicator IE of the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message is present, it must be possible to provide requested measurements for at least one of the cells specified in the message. This is possible if at least one of the cells is not already included in the existing measurement session requested by the eNodeB that initiated the ongoing procedure.

| Successful Resource Status Reporting Initiation operation        | The eNodeB2 initiates the requested measurement according                                 to the parameters given in the request. The eNodeB2 then                                 responds with the RESOURCE_STATUS_RESPONSE                                 message.  The eNodeB2 is the node from which the measurement is                                 requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Partly successful Resource Status Reporting Initiation operation | The eNodeB2 sends the                                     RESOURCE_STATUS_RESPONSE message if the                                     eNodeB2 provides some but not all the requested                                 resource status information, and the Partial Success Indicator IE is                                 present in the RESOURCE_STATUS_REQUEST message.

Ericsson Node Initiated Resource Status Reporting Initiation

The Ericsson eNodeB immediately requests measurements from the non-Ericsson eNodeB

when Inter-Vendor Load Balancing is activated. The Ericsson node uses the

RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message to request the measurements

from the non-Ericsson eNodeB. The RESOURCE\_STATUS\_REQUEST message

must always include the Partial Success Indicator IE.

Request for measurements from as many cells as possible must be included in one

message.  New request can only be sent if the previous request is answered.

When the Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature is deactivated, all measurements

requested from the non-Ericsson nodes must be stopped.

## 3.2 3GPP X2 Interface - Resource Status Reporting

The eNodeB2 (Ericsson eNodeB) starts the process to report the result of

measurements the eNodeB2 admitted, following a successful Resource Status

Reporting Initiation procedure.

The RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message is involved in the resource status

reporting process.

After the Resource Status Reporting is activated for at least one of the supported Report

Characteristics in at least one of the cells, the requested measurement is started and

periodically reported to the eNodeB1.

Figure 2   Resource Status Reporting from Ericsson Node to External Node

Figure 3   Resource Status Reporting from External Node to Ericsson Node

The eNodeB2 (Ericsson eNodeB) reports the results of the admitted measurements

in the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message. The admitted measurements are

the measurements that are successfully initiated during the preceding Resource Status

Reporting Initiation procedure. Therefore, the Measurement Failed Report Characteristics

IE does not report the measurements for the affected cell in the

RESOURCE\_STATUS\_RESPONSE message.

The Report Characteristics IE indicates the type of objects the eNodeB2

measures. For each cell, the eNodeB2 includes information elements in the

RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message.

If the Ericsson eNodeB receives the RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message,

which includes the Cell Reporting Indicator IE set to stop in one or

more items of the Cell Measurement Result IE, then the Ericsson eNodeB initializes the

Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure to remove all or some of the

corresponding cells from the measurement. If the Ericsson eNodeB receives a

RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message with measurement results other than

the requested measurement, the Ericsson eNodeB ignores the measurement results.

## 3.3 Inter-Vendor Load Balancing Cycle

The Inter-Vendor Load Balancing feature works as an extension of the Inter-Frequency

Load Balancing feature.

Each time the non-Ericsson node sends measurement results with the

RESOURCE\_STATUS\_UPDATE message, the sRatio is calculated. The

average sRatio is also calculated in every load balancing cycle for all external cells

in report. With that data as input, load balancing is continued.

As a part of Inter-Frequency Load Balancing, the Ericsson eNodeB calculates the number of

UEs that are moved to a specific cell for each neighboring cell in every load balancing

cycle.
