# 1 Zero Interference VoLTE Operation Overview

This feature increases the probability for voice to be scheduled in PRBs with low

uplink interference to improve voice quality.

Summary

This feature allows the uplink interference to spread over the whole spectrum and

reserve PRB regions next to PUCCH. The feature works dynamically on a TTI basis to

increase the probability for uplink voice packets to be scheduled in PRBs with low

interference to improve voice quality. The gain depends on the load and traffic

profile.

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

The feature integrates with ASGH framework to provide benefits for VoLTE

operation.

| ICIC - Autonomous Resource                                     Allocation (FAJ 121 1074)      | Related        | One function of the ICIC - Autonomous Resource Allocation feature is                                 the uplink interference management function, which randomly selects                                 the starting point in frequency. By default this function is                                 enabled. The Zero Interference VoLTE Operation feature keeps this                                 default setting to get better uplink interference management.  The other function is PUSCH PRB blocking which can limit the amount                                 of frequency resources allocated by the uplink scheduler. When PUSCH PRB blocking is enabled, the uplink interference management function                                 is disabled. When PUSCH PRB blocking is enabled, the blocked PRBs                                 can cause inaccurate PRB use estimation. This can affect the                                 accuracy of the decision that the reserved region is only available                                 for UE candidates. If the blocked PUSCH PRB locates in reserved                                 region, it reduces the possibility of this feature putting UE                                 candidates to uplink reserved region. |

# 3 Feature Operation of Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

This feature integrates with ASGH framework to select VoLTE or MCPTT UEs to reserved

regions.

The UE selection algorithm considers the following elements:

- SINR
- Path loss
- HARQ transmission number thresholds Note: These thresholds can be configured with parameters.

Operational Process

The uplink interference is spread over the whole spectrum. The feature works

dynamically on a TTI basis and allows to reserve PRB regions next to PUCCH. This

increases the probability for uplink voice packets to be scheduled in low interfered

PRBs. The gain depends on traffic load and traffic profile.

# 4 Network Impact of Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

The benefit of the feature depends on traffic load and traffic profile.

Capacity and Performance

The impact on cell throughput and UE throughput can be observed because of uplink

available spectrum becomes more fragmented or new transmission gets less PDCCH

resource in high PDCCH resource use case. The magnitude of this impact depends on

the load and traffic types in the cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.4 or later is required.

# 6 Performance of Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

When the feature is enabled in a group of intra-frequency in cells with relatively

high VoLTE traffic and relatively high VoLTE packet loss rate caused by interference, voice

performance can be potentially improved. This applies especially for UEs in poor

coverage.

# 7 Activate Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Minimum Interference Scheduling feature must be enabled.
- The ASGH Framework feature must be enabled.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012494 MO instance.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.ulHarqTxNoThresToRegion or the EUtranCellTDD.ulHarqTxNoThresToRegion attribute greater than 0.
3. Configure trigger lists to select VoLTE or MCPTT UEs into an ASGH group.
4. Set SubscriberGroupProfile.ulCandidateToRegion attribute to true, so UEs in this group can become candidates for reserved regions. Note: The SubscriberGroupProfile.ulPlThresToRegionand the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulSinrThresToRegion attributes can be configured to limit the number of UE candidates put in reserved regions.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012494 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

Zero Interference VoLTE Operation is turned off by default.

To improve the performance, it is recommended to enable uplink interference

management.

It is recommended to enable the feature in a group of intra-frequency cells with uplink

high interference issue. The interference is caused by resource fair resource allocation

strategy in small uplink PRB use, and in cells with relatively high VoLTE traffic and

relatively high VoLTE packet loss rate caused by interference. Enabling the feature in

mixed-mode can impact the gain, because the feature is applicable for Baseband Radio

Nodes only.

## 9.1 Configure Zero Interference VoLTE Operation

To benefit from the feature, it must be configured after the activation.

Prerequisites

- The prerequisite features are activated on the node.
- The conflicting features are deactivated on the node.
- The Zero Interference VoLTE Operation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.ulHarqTxNoThresToRegion or EUtranCellTDD.ulHarqTxNoThresToRegion attribute greater than 0. Value 1 means new transmissions and all retransmissions of UE candidates can be put to reserved regions. Value greater than 1 means only retransmissions that meet the threshold are candidates for reserved region.
2. Configure trigger lists to select VoLTE or MCPTT UEs into an ASGH group.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulCandidateToRegion attribute to true so UEs in this group can become candidates for reserved regions.
4. Set optionally the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulPlThresToRegion and the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulSinrThresToRegion attribute to limit the number of UE candidates put in reserved regions.

- Cells with channel bandwidth 20 MHz.
- Prerequisite features are activated, and conflicting features are deactivated, and suggested feature are enabled.
- Reserved region size is 10.
- All retransmissions can be selected to reserved regions.
- UEs with path loss are greater or equal to 50 dB and SINR is less or equal to 40 dB are considered.
- Configure ASGH subscriber group 0 to select VoLTE UEs.

1. Activate prerequisite feature and deactivate the conflicting features: Deactivate feature license for Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling. Deactivate feature license for Evolved Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling. Disable the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature. Make sure NB-IoT Access in-band deployment mode of customer-specific configuration is not configured. Disable the LTE-NR Dynamic Spectrum Sharing feature. Disable the Uplink Adaptive Retransmission Enhancement feature by setting the EUtranCellFDD.noOfEnhAdptReTxCand or EUtranCellTDD.noOfEnhAdptReTxCand attribute to 0. Enable the Minimum Interference Scheduling feature by setting the minInterfSchedEnabled attribute to true and the minInterfUlRegionSize must be greater than or equal to 3. It is recommended to enable uplink interference management by setting the ulInterferenceManagementActive attribute to true and the ulInterferenceManagementDuration attribute to 5000.
2. Set the minInterfSchedEnabled attribute to true and the minInterfUlRegionSize attribute to 10.
3. Set the ulHarqTxNoThresToRegion attribute to 2.
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile to 0 and the bearerTriggerListqci to 1.
5. Set the ulCandidateToRegion attribute to true.
6. Keep the ulPlThresToRegion as 500 and the ulSinrThresToRegion as 400 as default.
