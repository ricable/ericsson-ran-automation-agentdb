# 1 NR-NR Dual Connectivity Overview

The NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature introduces support for Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity

with the 5GC. This allows the UE to be connected to one gNodeB acting as the Master Node and

another gNodeB acting as the Secondary Node.

Summary

The NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature enables the UE to connect to the 5GC using a Master Node

with Low-Band (FR1) or Mid-Band (FR1) and a Secondary Node

with High-Band (FR2) NR frequencies.

The feature allows the UE to take advantage of the downlink and uplink bit rates of

High-Band frequencies while the UE is connected to the 5GC using

Low-Band or Mid-Band anchor frequencies.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- The UEs utilize the higher bit rates of High-Band frequencies both in downlink and uplink.
- The packet processing resources are offloaded in gNodeBs with Low-Band or Mid-Band frequencies by using PDCP resources in gNodeBs with High-Band frequencies.

## 1.1 NR-DC Deployment

The NR-DC-capable UE operating in NR SA mode is always connected to a gNodeB with

Low-Band (FR1) or Mid-Band (FR1) frequencies. This type of

gNodeB acts as the Master Node in NR-DC. The UE can connect to another gNodeB with

High-Band (FR2) frequencies if the UE is in High-Band

coverage. This type of gNodeB acts as the Secondary Node in NR-DC. The UE connects to

the Master Node over the Uu interface. The Uu interface between the UE and the Secondary

Node is only established when the UE is configured with NR-DC.

The Master Node is connected to the 5GC over the NG interface. The NG-C interface is used

for control plane, while the NG-U interface is used for user plane.

The Secondary Node connects to the 5GC over the NG-U interface for user plane.

The Master Node and the Secondary Node are connected to each other over the Xn interface.

The Xn-C interface is used for control plane, while the Xn-U interface is used for user

plane. One Master Node can be connected to several Secondary Nodes, and one Secondary

Node can be connected to several Master Nodes.

Figure 1   Interface Connections in NR-DC

In NR-DC, the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED mode in the Master Node. The

control of the UE is managed through the RRC signaling between the UE and the Master

Node. Information specific to the Secondary Node resources is carried by containers

conveying RRC messages between the Secondary Node and the Master Node over the Xn-C

interface and between the Master Node and the UE over the Uu interface.

The following cell groups can serve the NR-DC-capable UE:

| Master Cell Group (MCG)    |    | The MCG, configured for Low-Band or Mid-Band                             frequencies, is provided by the Master Node. The MCG consists of one                             PCell and optionally one or several SCells.   |
|----------------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Secondary Cell Group (SCG) |    | The SCG, configured for High-Band frequencies, is provided                             by the Secondary Node. The SCG consists of one PSCell and optionally one                             or several SCells.          |

When the UE is configured with NR-DC, the following types of PDU sessions are provided

for user data transport between the UE and a data network using the 5GC:

| Master Node terminated PDU sessions    |    | This type of PDU session carries QoS flows configured with specific 5QI                             profiles and ARP levels that prevent the QoS flows from being Secondary                             Node terminated. This is why all QoS flows within this type of PDU                             session are terminated by the Master Node. For such a PDU session, one                             user plane tunnel is configured over the NG-U interface for all its QoS                             flows between the Master Node and the 5GC.   |
|----------------------------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                        |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions |    | This type of PDU session carries QoS flows configured with specific 5QI                             profiles and ARP levels that allow the QoS flow to be Secondary Node                             terminated. This is why all QoS flows within this type of PDU session                             are terminated by the Secondary Node. For such a PDU session, one user                             plane tunnel is set up over the NG-U interface for all its QoS flows                             between the Secondary Node and the 5GC.         |

It is possible that a UE connected with NR-DC can use a combination of the two

types of PDU sessions. This way a UE can have some QoS flows that are Secondary Node

terminated, while some other QoS flows for the UE remain to be Master Node

terminated.

Figure 2   Termination of QoS Flows within PDU Sessions

QoS flows are carried by DRBs between the UE, the Master Node, and the Secondary Node.

When the UE is connected with NR-DC, the UE can be configured with the following bearer types:

| Master Node terminated MCG DRBs      |    | The Master Node terminated MCG DRBs use only MCG radio resources and the                             packet processing resources of the Master Node. These DRBs transmit user                             plane traffic between the UE and the Master Node. The Master Node                             terminated MCG DRBs are ciphered and deciphered in the Master Node.                                           |
|--------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                      |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Secondary Node terminated split DRBs |    | The Secondary Node terminated split DRBs use MCG and SCG radio resources,                             and the packet processing resources of the Secondary Node. Split DRBs                             are configured with both the MCG and SCG radio resources after Secondary                             Node Addition. These DRBs are ciphered and deciphered in the Secondary                             Node. |

# 2 Dependencies of NR-NR Dual Connectivity

The feature has prerequisites. The UE connected with NR-DC is handled differently

when used with a number of other features. Related features impact NR-DC performance. The

feature comes with requirements on the 5GC, the UE, the number of Baseband units and on the

5QI settings.

| Measurement Gap-Aware NR Scheduling                                                                                  | FAJ 121 5295       | NR            | Prerequisite   |                      | For A4 measurements aiming for NR-DC setup on High-Band frequencies, a gapless                 measurement configuration is applied in the following use cases:  The UE supports independent measurement gap configuration.     The measurement gap for High-Band inter-frequency measurements is                             disabled for UEs based on the configuration of the                                 CapabilityHandlingUeCfg.gaplessFr2InterFreqMeasSupp                             attribute.     Otherwise, the measurement gap is configured in the Master Node when an A4                 measurement is started for NR-DC setup. If the A4 measurement configuration is                 removed, the measurement gap is only needed in NR-DC if the Master Node configures                 other measurements that require a measurement gap. If the measurement gap is configured in the                 Master Node, the configuration is forwarded to the Secondary Node using the                 Secondary Node Addition procedure. If the measurement gap is added, removed, or                 changed in the Master Node, the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification                 procedure is used to coordinate the measurement gap with the Secondary Node.  The Secondary Node does not schedule user data transmission during the measurement                 gap that is received from the Master Node.  As specified by 3GPP, measurement gap requirement information reporting is not                 supported in NR-DC. This is why measurement gap requirement information provided by                 the UE is not used when the UE is configured with NR-DC.  Independent measurement gap configuration is supported based on UE capabilities. |

If NR-DC is not enabled for the new UE             group, the Master Node initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure. As a result, the             Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are not kept during a VoNR call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If the Secondary Node in NR-DC is established, the Multi-Layer Coordination and                 Bandwith-Triggered Inter-System Handover procedures stop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Hardware

NR-DC is not supported if the Master Node and the Secondary Node are located in the

same Baseband.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

- The UE must be capable of NR-DC and compliant with the 15.6.0 or later version of the RRC protocol.
- The AMF in the 5GC must support the PDU Session Resource Modify Indication procedure compliant with the 15.8.0 or later version of the NGAP protocol.
- The RLC mode for a specific 5QI must be set to the same value in both the Master Node and in the Secondary Node. In both of the nodes, the RLC mode for a 5QI is set using the CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute under the CUCP5qiTable MO for the corresponding 5QI.
- The PDCP sequence number length for a specific 5QI must be set to the same value in both the Master Node and in the Secondary Node. In both of the nodes, the PDCP sequence number length for a 5QI is set using the CUCP5qi.pdcpSnSize attribute.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## 3.1 Master Node Criteria for NR-DC Setup

The criteria for NR-DC setup are evaluated in the Master Node for the following cases:

- At Initial Context Setup
- At the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure
- At the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure
- At the PDU Session Resource Release procedure
- At an incoming handover to the Master Node
- At both the Master Node Initiated and the Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedures
- At restarting an A4 measurement
- At the reception of a report that UAI overheating is mitigated
- At the reception of high downlink RLC or uplink buffer status report

An A4 measurement is used to detect that the UE is in High-Band coverage. The purpose of

this inter-frequency measurement is that the UE finds a candidate PSCell on a High-Band

frequency to establish NR-DC.

Downlink RLC buffer monitoring makes it possible to trigger the NR-DC setup based on

UE traffic level in the downlink RLC buffer.

Uplink buffer monitoring makes it possible to trigger the NR-DC setup

based on the UE traffic level in the uplink buffer.

Through buffer-based NR-DC setup, unnecessary NR-DC setups can be avoided for UEs

with short data sessions.

Figure 4 shows the operational flow of

evaluating the NR-DC setup criteria.

### 3.1.1 A4 Measurement Criteria

The following conditions must be fulfilled for the Master Node to configure the UE to

start A4 measurements for the NR-DC setup:

- The NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature is activated and operable on the Master Node.
- The NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcEnabled attribute is set to true in the instance of the cell MO that represents the PCell on the Master Node.
- At least one established PDU session is allowed by configuration to be Secondary Node terminated.
- Measurement objects, which are the SSBs on High-Band frequencies, can be selected with all the following conditions being fulfilled: The frequency of the measurement object is represented by an NRFrequency MO instance. At least one NRFreqRelation MO instance exists from the NRCellCU MO instance that represents the PCell to the NRFrequency MO instance that represents the High-Band frequency of the measurement object. Note: The NRFreqRelation MO instance between the PCell and the High-Band frequency must be created manually. The UE is capable of at least one combination that supports NR-DC of the following bands: At least one band of the PCell frequency. At least one band of the NRFrequency MO that represents the High-Band frequency of the measurement object. Such band combinations are checked against the list of the allowed band combinations. If the list exists, it contains the band combinations filtered by the operating band of the PCell frequency. If the list does not exist, all bands of the PCell frequency are considered. If multiple instances of the NRFrequency MO exist with different High-Band frequencies, it is possible to configure multiple High-Band frequencies in an A4 measurement.

Figure 5 shows the Master Node MO structure with

relations considered for A4 measurements.

### 3.1.2 Buffer Monitoring in NR-DC

If all the preconditions for starting an A4 measurement are met, the Master Node can

start the buffer monitoring function.

If all the conditions for starting an A4 measurement in Table 2 are fulfilled, the Master Node can

Depending on the configuration, the following use cases exist for buffer monitoring in

NR-DC:

- Only downlink RLC buffer monitoring is configured. Downlink RLC buffer monitoring is performed on DRB level. When high buffer status has been reported for one DRB, downlink buffer monitoring stops for all other DRBs for a specific UE.
- Only uplink buffer monitoring is configured. Uplink buffer monitoring is performed on LCG level. When high buffer status has been reported for one LCG, uplink buffer monitoring for other monitored LCGs is stopped for a specific UE.
- Both downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring are configured. If both downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring thresholds are configured, high buffer status is set when either the downlink RLC or the uplink threshold is exceeded.

### 3.1.3 A4 Measurement Configuration

The A4 measurement is configured for the UE during the RRC Reconfiguration procedure to

have one or more SSBs on High-Band frequencies as measurement objects selected according

to the A4 measurement selection criteria.

The measurement objects included in an A4 measurement are listed in

randomized order, and the number of measurement objects is defined by the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4 attribute. For example, if the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4 attribute is set to

2, and four measurement objects are selected based on the selection

criteria, only two measurement objects are configured for the measurement.

The trigger quantity for the A4 measurement is RSRP, and the measurement is started and

stopped periodically. The measurement time is the sum of the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMeasTime attribute value and the value

set in the timeToTrigger member of the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate attribute. The

measurement interval, while the measurement is halted, is configured through the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMeasRestartTime attribute. This

configurable periodicity of the measurement provides a means of limiting UE battery

consumption. The A4 measurement is stopped and removed from the UE configuration at the

Secondary Node Addition procedure. No A4 measurement is started while the UE is

connected with NR-DC. The A4 measurement restarts when the Secondary Node Release

procedure is triggered, either by the Master Node or the Secondary Node.

Figure 6   A4 Measurement Handling and Periodicity

A4

measurements are performed as gapless measurements for the following UEs:

- UEs that support independent measurement gap configuration
- UEs for which the value of the CapabilityHandlingUeCfg.gaplessFr2InterFreqMeasSupp attribute is set to true

Otherwise, the measurement gap is configured on all

frequencies.

The NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate attribute contains the

following configurable members for the A4 measurement:

| threshold     |    | The value is used to configure the threshold. If the RSRP of any cell on                             the measured High-Band frequency is above the threshold, the UE sends an                             A4 measurement report to the Master Node.   |
|---------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| hysteresis    |    | The value is used to prevent the retriggering of an A4 measurement report                             if the measured value fluctuates close to the configured threshold.                                                                             |
|               |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| timeToTrigger |    | The value defines how long the threshold criteria must be fulfilled                             before triggering an A4 measurement report.                                                                                                           |

In addition to the RSRP threshold that is applicable to all frequencies,

the NRFreqRelation.nrdcA4ThrRsrpFreqOffset attribute can be used to

configure a frequency-specific offset. The value of the

NRFreqRelation.nrdcA4ThrRsrpFreqOffset attribute is added to the value

of the threshold struct member of the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate attribute.

### 3.1.4 Evaluation of A4 Measurement Report

The UE sends the A4 measurement report to the Master Node in the RRC

MeasurementReport message.

If

the following criteria are met, the Master Node initiates the Secondary Node Addition

procedure to the gNodeB hosting the PSCell candidate the UE reported:

- The NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcEnabled attribute is set to true, so that the NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature is enabled for the PCell on the Master Node.
- The reported PCI can be mapped to an existing ExternalNRCellCU MO instance representing the PSCell candidate on the measured High-Band frequency. The MO is a child to the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO representing the Secondary Node in the MO structure of the Master Node.
- One NRCellRelation MO instance exists between the ExternalNRCellCU MO and the NRCellCU MO instance that represents the serving PCell on the Master Node. Note: The NRCellRelation MO instance between the NRCellCU and ExternalNRCellCU MOs must be created manually.
- At least one band combination exists in the list of allowed band combinations that contains the band of the found PSCell candidate.
- A PDU session exists for this UE that is allowed to be Secondary Node terminated by configuration.
- A connection over the Xn interface exists between the Master Node hosting the PCell and the Secondary Node hosting the PSCell candidate. The connection is represented by a TermPointToGNodeB MO instance. The MO is a child to the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO representing the Secondary Node in the MO structure of the Master Node. For the connection to be functional, the TermPointToGNodeB.administrativeState attribute must be set to UNLOCKED and the TermPointToGNodeB.operationalState attribute must display ENABLED.

## 3.2 Termination Point Control of QoS Flows in the Master Node

For each QoS flow, the 5GC provides a 5QI value and an ARP value. These values are

compared to a framework of 5QI profiles and the configuration of Secondary Node

termination to determine whether a QoS flow is allowed to be Secondary Node terminated

or not.

Figure 7   MO Structure for Controlling Secondary Node Termination of QoS Flows

The CUCP5qi MO instance under the CUCP5qiTable MO

contains the configuration of a specific 5QI profile. The

CUCP5qi.nrdcSnTerminationRef attribute can contain a reference to

an NrdcSnTermination MO instance.

The NrdcSnTermination MO has the

NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg MO as its child. The

NrdcSnTermination and the

NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg MOs are both defined by the operator or

created automatically. The NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg.nrdcSnTermAllowed

attribute is used to apply different settings for each ARP applicable to the 5QI profile

referencing the parent NrdcSnTermination MO instance. The attribute

is configured to control whether a QoS flow with the 5QI profile is allowed to be

Secondary Node terminated or not.

Figure 8   Configuration Example

The NrdcSnTermination = SnTerminationProhibited MO

instance is automatically created with a child NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg

= Base MO instance. This instance prohibits QoS flows for IMS signaling, voice, and

latency-sensitive services with 5QI 1, 5, 65, 66, and 69 to be terminated by the

Secondary Node. These 5QIs are associated with the

SnTerminationProhibited MO instance when the

CUCP5qi.nrdcSnTerminationRef attribute is empty. No manual

configuration is required.

For other 5QIs, a default instance of the NrdcSnTermination MO can be

created with the NrdcSnTermination.defaultNrdcSnTerm attribute set to

true. This way, all 5QIs (except 5QIs 1, 5, 65, 66, and 69) with an

empty CUCP5qi.nrdcSnTerminationRef attribute use the configuration

provided by the default instance of NrdcSnTermination MO. If no

default instance of the NrdcSnTermination MO exists, these 5QIs

cannot be terminated by the Secondary Node.

5QIs with a non-empty CUCP5qi.nrdcSnTerminationRef attribute use the

configuration provided by the referenced NrdcSnTermination MO

instance.

More NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg MO instances can be created for the 5QI if

there is a need to differentiate the configuration further for each UE group.

A

PDU session is allowed to be Secondary Node terminated if all of its QoS flows are

allowed to be Secondary Node terminated. By controlling QoS flow termination, a UE can

use a combination of different types of PDU sessions. One type of PDU session has only

Master Node terminated QoS flows, while the other has only Secondary Node terminated QoS

flows. The same configuration, whether Secondary Node termination is allowed or not, is

recommended for all QoS flows in the same PDU session.

## 3.3 Bearer Type Change in NR-DC

A bearer type change is when one type of DRB is reconfigured into the other. This occurs

at different NR-DC procedures that trigger DRB reconfiguration. Bearer type changes

exist between the following types of DRBs supported in NR-DC:

- Master Node terminated MCG DRB
- Secondary Node terminated split DRB

The NR-DC-capable UE can be in one of the following states depending on the DRB type it uses:

| Idle Mode                                |    | The UE is in RRC_IDLE                             mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Connected Mode with NR-DC Not Configured |    | The UE is connected to the Master Node using one or more Master Node                             terminated MCG DRBs only. Therefore, user plane traffic is transmitted                             through the Master Node only.  At this stage, if all the criteria for starting an A4 measurement are                             met, the UE is configured by the Master Node to start A4 measurements to                             find a candidate PSCell on a High-Band                             frequency.  At the reception of the A4 measurement report, the Master Node initiates                             the Secondary Node Addition procedure, if all the criteria for the                             procedure are met.

A combination of one or more Master Node terminated MCG DRBs                                         and one or more Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.      Different scenarios can trigger the Master Node initiated or the                             Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure.

## 3.4 User Plane Management

With the Secondary Node resources available to the UE, the bearer type can be changed

from Master Node terminated DRBs to Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.

For

Secondary Node terminated split DRBs, the user plane provided to the UE is set up in the

following ways:

- Downlink traffic is transmitted through the MCG or SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB depending on the High-Band downlink radio link quality. Downlink data can be aggregated over both the MCG and SCG radio resources depending on the amount of data.
- Uplink traffic is transmitted either through the MCG or SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB. The uplink data path through which the uplink traffic is transmitted is based initially on configuration and then the High-Band uplink radio link quality. Uplink user data can be aggregated over both the MCG and SCG radio resources depending on the following variables: The amount of user data The UE capability to support splitting of uplink PDCP data on both the MCG and SCG for the Secondary Node terminated split DRB The configuration of the uplink data split threshold

The different user plane management functions used in NR-DC are provided by the following

features operable on the Secondary Node:

- The LTE-NR Dual Connectivity provides the means of configuring the following functions also used in NR-DC, with differentiated configurations for NR-DC, compared to EN-DC: The initial primary path of uplink user data The switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB The switching of uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB
- The LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation provides the means of configuring whether uplink user data is aggregated over both the MCG and SCG radio resources in NR-DC. The configurations are differentiated for NR-DC, compared to EN-DC.
- The LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation provides the means of configuring the following functions also used in NR-DC, with differentiated configurations for NR-DC, compared to EN-DC: The downlink aggregation of the MCG and SCG radio resources The PDCP flow control mechanism

## 3.5 NR-DC Band Combination Selection

The band combination and feature set are selected among the allowed ones to maximize SCG

carrier aggregation and optimize Layer 1 and Layer 2 configuration. Band combinations

contain the operating bands of the PCell frequency and the SCG frequencies that support

NR-DC. The UE support of the different band combinations and feature sets is signaled in

the NR-DC-specific UE capabilities.

The Master Node requests the NR-DC-specific UE capabilities (if not received from the

AMF) from the UE at Initial Context Setup.

A

candidate PSCell is considered if the UE is capable of a band combination supporting

NR-DC that contains the following:

- The band of the PCell frequency
- The band of the High-Band frequency of the candidate PSCell

Band combination and feature set selection is a distributed function between the Master

Node and the Secondary Node according to the following

steps:

1. The Master Node assembles a list of allowed band combinations based on the reported NR-DC-specific UE capabilities. This list contains the band combinations that fulfill the following criteria: The band combination contains the PCell frequency band and it supports NR-DC. The band combination and the feature set support any of the possible PCell configurations. Note: A PCell configuration is possible if it is supported by the cell capabilities of the PCell, such as the number of MIMO layers, bandwidth, and modulation that the PCell can handle. The generation of the allowed band combination list in the Master Node can result in one of the following outcomes: If the list is not empty and it contains the High-Band frequency of the latest A4 measurement report in at least one band combination supporting NR-DC for the UE, the Secondary Node Addition procedure can be triggered. The list is not empty, but it does not contain the High-Band frequency of the latest A4 measurement report in any band combinations supporting NR-DC for the UE. In this case, the Master Node does not trigger the Secondary Node Addition procedure at the reception of an A4 measurement report. However, subsequent A4 measurements can start. If the list is empty, the Master Node does not trigger the Secondary Node Addition procedure at the reception of an A4 measurement report. In addition, no subsequent A4 measurement is started while the UE remains in connected mode in the same PCell.
2. The Master Node signals the list of allowed band combinations to the Secondary Node at the Secondary Node Addition and Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Change procedures using the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message.
3. At the reception of the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message, the Secondary Node uses the list of allowed band combinations and NR-DC-specific UE capabilities to select the best possible cell set for the SCG. It selects, for example, the number of carrier components, the MIMO layers and the type of modulation in a way that maximizes the Secondary Node throughput.
4. The Secondary Node signals the SCG configuration to the Master Node using the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
5. At the reception of the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the Master Node selects the best possible cell set for the MCG given the SCG configuration provided by the Secondary Node. This can involve the following actions: The Master Node reconfigures the PCell. The Master Node adds or removes SCells from the MCG if carrier aggregation is applied on the Master Node.

## 3.6 User Activity Supervision

For the UE configured with NR-DC, both the Master Node and the Secondary Node monitor

user activity. The Master Node does it on UE level, considering the overall UE state of

being active or inactive.

The PDCP layer in the Master Node monitors the activity of all the Master Node terminated

MCG DRBs for the UE. The DRB is inactive if it is not used for user data transmission

during the time period defined by the inactivity timer set on the Master Node in the

InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimer attribute.

The Master Node also monitors if NAS RRC messages are sent or received during the time

period defined

by

the NAS inactivity timer. The timer is set in the Master Node using the

GNBCUCPFunction.nasInactivityTime attribute expires.

The PDCP layer in the Secondary Node monitors the activity of all Secondary Node

terminated split DRBs. These DRBs are inactive if they are not used for user data

transmission for the time value of the

InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimerNrdcSn attribute. When the

Secondary Node detects that the activity state of the Secondary Node terminated split

DRBs change (from active to inactive or from inactive to active), it sends the

XnAP ACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message to the Master Node. This message

is used to notify the Master Node about the activity state of the Secondary Node

terminated split DRBs for the UE. When new Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are set

up for the UE configured with NR-DC, all Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are

considered active in the Master Node.

High buffer status indicated by downlink RLC buffer

monitoring or uplink buffer monitoring in the Master Node is cleared if the Secondary

Node indicates the inactivity of Secondary Node-terminated DRBs.

Figure 10   User Activity Supervision in NR-DC

The Master Node releases the UE to RRC\_IDLE mode when all the following

criteria are fulfilled:

- The Master Node terminated MCG DRBs are inactive as indicated by the expired inactivity timer.
- The Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are inactive as indicated by the notification from the Secondary Node.
- No NAS RRC messages are sent or received during the configured time period.

## 3.7 Xn Link Break Handling

An Xn link break occurs when the connection between the Master Node and the Secondary

Node is lost over the Xn-C interface. The Xn link break can typically be caused by any

of the following cases:

- Transport failure occurs over the Xn interface.
- Either the Master Node or the Secondary Node restarts or is not operational.
- The local termination point of the Xn interface on the Master Node or on the Secondary Node is locked. This occurs when the TermPointToGNodeB.administrativeState attribute is set to LOCKED.

Figure 11   Sequence of Xn Link Break Handling at Lost Xn Connection

The Xn link break handling in NR-DC is done according to the following sequence:

1. The Xn link break is detected both in the Master Node and the Secondary Node independently. When the Xn link break is caused by setting the TermPointToGNodeB.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED, the SCTP association shuts down for transport over the Xn interface before the detection of the Xn link break. The TermPointToGNodeB.operationalState attribute displays DISABLED. If the termination point is locked on the Master Node, it is the Master Node that shuts down the SCTP association. If the termination point is locked on the Secondary Node, it is the Secondary Node that shuts down the SCTP association.
2. The NG Reset procedure is used between the Master Node and the AMF.
    1. The Master Node sends the NGAP NG RESET message to the AMF. This message contains the list of UEs using Secondary Node terminated split DRBs served by the broken Xn link. The message indicates the release of all the affected UEs.
    2. The AMF responds to the Master Node with the NGAP NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
3. All the MCG and the SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRBs, as well as all other UE-specific resources, allocated to the affected UEs are locally released. This occurs in both the Master Node and the Secondary Node simultaneously.
4. The Master Node and the Secondary Node initiate new Xn link setup attempts independently to restore connection over the Xn interface. However, when the Xn link break is caused by locking the termination point, no Xn link re-establishment is initiated either by the Master Node or the Secondary Node.

The XnC Link to GNodeB Failure alarm is raised on both the

Master Node and the Secondary Node at Xn link break. However, when the Xn link break is

caused by locking the termination point, no alarm is raised either on the Master Node or

on the Secondary Node.

## 3.8 Master Node Mobility Support in NR-DC

The following mobility cases are supported when the UE is connected with NR-DC:

- Intra-gNodeB handover cases: Intra-frequency intra-gNodeB handover Inter-frequency intra-gNodeB handover Intra-cell handover
- Inter-gNodeB handover cases: Intra-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover Inter-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover
- Outgoing IRAT handover to LTE

Incoming IRAT handover from LTE is supported.

All handovers follow NR Mobility procedures.

### 3.8.1 Intra-gNodeB Handover When NR-DC Is Configured

The following intra-gNodeB mobility cases are supported in NR-DC for the Master Node:

- Intra-frequency intra-gNodeB handover
- Inter-frequency intra-gNodeB handover
- Intra-cell handover

A3 and A5 measurements for Master Node mobility are configured to also contain

measurement results for the serving PSCell frequency in the SCG.

The outcome of the handover procedures can be one of the following:

- Master Node-based handover into a new or the same PCell with immediate NR-DC setup
- A4 measurement configuration or one of the following types of buffer monitoring: Downlink RLC buffer monitoring Uplink buffer monitoring Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

For intra-cell handover, the candidate PSCell for immediate NR-DC setup is the same as

the PSCell used before the handover. For intra-frequency and inter-frequency

intra-gNodeB handover, the candidate PSCell is selected based on the SCG measurement

results reported by the UE in the A3 or A5 measurement report.

Secondary Node Addition is not performed for a candidate PSCell if the cell is on a

denylist.

If there are no valid PSCell candidates for

intra-frequency

intra-gNodeB handover and inter-frequency intra-gNodeB handover, the following

procedures are started:

- Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release
- A4 measurement configuration or one of the following types of buffer monitoring: Downlink RLC buffer monitoring Uplink buffer monitoring Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

During the handover, packet forwarding is performed.

If the measurement gap is reconfigured, the Master Node might send

an additional RRC RRCReconfiguration message to the UE and an additional

Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure is performed.

### 3.8.2 Inter-gNodeB Handover When NR-DC Is Configured

The following inter-gNodeB mobility cases are supported in NR-DC for the Master Node over

the NG interface:

- Intra-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover
- Inter-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover

A3 and A5 measurements for Master Node mobility are configured to additionally contain

measurement results for the serving PSCell frequency in the SCG.

The handover procedures can have one of the following outcomes:

- Master Node-based handover into a new PCell with immediate NR-DC setup
- A4 measurement configuration

The candidate PSCell for immediate NR-DC setup is selected based on the SCG measurement

results reported by the UE in the A3 or A5 measurement report.

If the conditions for immediate NR-DC setup are met, the following procedures are

performed during the handover:

- Secondary Node Addition is initiated by the target Master Node to set up resources for the new selected candidate PSCell.
- Secondary Node Release is initiated by the source Master Node to release resources for the old PSCell.

If there are no valid PSCell candidates, the following procedures are started:

- Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release
- A4 measurement configuration

During the handover, packet forwarding is performed, unless the gNodeB blocklist of one

of the Master Nodes is configured to not allow packet forwarding from or to the other

Master Node.

If the measurement gap is reconfigured, the Master Node might send

an additional RRC RRCReconfiguration message to the UE and an additional

Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure is performed.

### 3.8.3 IRAT Handover to LTE When NR-DC Is Configured

The

IRAT inter-system handover to LTE is described in NR Mobility. In

NR-DC, the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure is performed during

the IRAT inter-system handover. Direct packet forwarding is supported over the X2-U

interface from both the Master Node and the Secondary Node to the eNodeB.

During the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure triggered by the IRAT

inter-system handover, the Secondary Node does not

send

the XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the Master Node,

since

the PDCP Sequence Number is reset at the target eNodeB.

### 3.8.4 Incoming IRAT Handover from LTE into an NR-DC-Capable PCell

The handling of the incoming IRAT handover from LTE follows the procedure of the NR

Mobility feature.

The target gNodeB, acting as the Master Node configures the UE to perform A4 measurements

or it starts one of the following types of buffer monitoring:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring
- Uplink buffer monitoring
- Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

The aim is to find a candidate PSCell for the Secondary Node Addition procedure

after the handover, when the UE sends the A4 measurement report.

## 3.9 Secondary Node Mobility Support in NR-DC

### 3.9.1 Intra-Frequency, Inter-gNodeB PSCell Change When NR-DC Is Configured

For the UE connected with NR-DC, intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change is supported

while intra-frequency, intra-gNB PSCell change is not. The A3 measurement is configured

on the Secondary Node by using the following attributes:

- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.betterSpCellTriggerQuantity
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpBetterSpCellThe attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqBetterSpCellThe attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.sinrBetterSpCellThe attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger

The UE performs A3 measurements on the frequency of the PSCell to find a High-Band cell

with better radio link quality to be the candidate for PSCell change. The A3 measurement

configuration is transmitted to the UE at the Secondary Node Addition procedure that is

triggered either by initial NR-DC setup, or inter-gNodeB PSCell change. If the UE finds

a High-Band cell that has better radio link quality than the serving PSCell based on the

configuration, the A3 measurement is triggered.

The UE sends the A3 measurement report to the Master Node and the Master Node forwards

the A3 measurement report to the source Secondary Node where the report is evaluated. If

the reported PCI is a known external neighbor in the Secondary Node, intra-frequency,

inter-gNodeB PSCell change is triggered by using the Secondary Node Initiated Secondary

Node Change procedure. The A3 measurement report is ignored if the PCI is unknown or it

is a known internal neighbor in the source Secondary

Node.

After the Secondary Node sends the S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUIRED message,

the Primary Node checks if the cell is on a denylist. If the cell is on a denylist,

Secondary Node Addition is not performed.

During intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change, the source Secondary Node initiates

the Secondary Node Change procedure. Downlink packet forwarding is initiated from the

source Secondary Node to the target Secondary Node. Direct packet forwarding can be

prevented, if the gNodeB blocklist of one of the Secondary Nodes is configured to not

allow packet forwarding from or to the other node. After the UE performs a successful

Random Access procedure in the target PSCell, the target Secondary Node can send and

receive user data in the SCG.

### 3.9.2 A2 Measurement-Based Secondary Node Release for NR-DC

This procedure is triggered for UEs that have been determined through an A2

measurement to be in critical PSCell coverage or poor radio link quality.

If the McpcNrdcPSCellProfileUeCfg.mcpcA2Quantity attribute is set to

other than NONE and the UE enters critical coverage in the PSCell, or

poor radio link quality is detected, the Secondary Node initiates the Secondary Node

Release procedure for the UE.

The A2 measurements can be configured at the following procedures to detect critical

PSCell coverage and poor radio link

quality:

- Secondary Node Addition
- Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Change
- Master Node-based Handover with Immediate Secondary Node Addition
- Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification

The A2 measurement uses the following trigger quantities to detect critical coverage and

poor radio link quality:

- RSRP
- RSRQ
- SINR

It is possible to use combinations of trigger quantities. In this case, separate

measurement IDs are configured for each selected trigger quantity as specified in the

McpcNrdcPSCellProfileUeCfg.mcpcA2Quantities attribute. For UEs

that do not support SINR, the A2 measurement can be configured with RSRP and RSRQ as the

only trigger quantities.

The A2 measurement can be enabled through the

McpcNrdcPSCellProfileUeCfg.mcpcA2Quantity attribute. The trigger

quantities can be configured through the following attributes:

- McpcNrdcPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCritical The attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger
- McpcNrdcPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCritical The attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger
- McpcNrdcPSCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCritical The attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger

## 3.10 Scenarios for Master Node Triggered NR-DC Procedures

### 3.10.1 Detection of High Buffer Status

If downlink RLC buffer monitoring is enabled, the Master Node configures the UE with A4

measurement if either or both of the following thresholds are exceeded and high buffer

status is set in the Master Node:

- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr

If uplink buffer monitoring is enabled, the Master Node configures the UE

with A4 measurement if the threshold configured in the

UlBufferMonCfg.ulBsVolThresh attribute is exceeded and high

buffer status is set in the Master Node.

### 3.10.2 Reception of an A4 Measurement Report

The UE, as configured to perform inter-frequency A4 measurements, reports

the PCI of a candidate PSCell on a High-Band frequency to the Master Node.

When an A4 measurement report is received by the Master Node, the Secondary Node Addition

procedure starts if all the criteria for triggering the procedure are met.

### 3.10.3 Reception and Transmission of a Measurement Report to the Secondary Node

If a UE that is configured with NR-DC finds a High-Band cell that has better radio link

quality than the serving PSCell by performing A3 measurements, the UE sends the A3

measurement report to the Master Node by using the RRC

ULInformationTransferMRDC message. The Master Node forwards the A3

measurement report by sending the XnAP RRC TRANSFER message to the source

Secondary Node, where the measurement report is evaluated.

If a UE that is configured with NR-DC enters critical coverage in the PSCell or

detects poor radio link quality, it sends the A2 measurement report to the Master

Node by using the RRC ULInformationTransferMRDC message. The Master

Node forwards the

A2

measurement report by sending the XnAP RRC TRANSFER

message to the source Secondary Node, where it is evaluated.

### 3.10.4 UE Indicating SCG Radio Link Failure

The UE can indicate RLF by sending the SCGFailureInformation RRC message

to the Master Node in the following cases:

- It is not possible to perform random access to the PSCell during the Secondary Node Addition procedure.
- The configured maximum number of allowed RLC retransmissions is reached in uplink.
- The timer set in the Rrc.t310 attribute expires.

At the reception of the SCGFailureInformation RRC message, the Master Node

initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure.

Related Information

Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

#### 3.10.4.1 UE Requesting the SCG to Be Released

The UE can send the RRC SCGFailureInformation message to the Master Node

to trigger a Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure. This way, the UE

can request a release of the SCG when it is not needed.

The UE indicates the request to release the SCG with the following attributes in the

measResultFreqList IE set to the appropriate values:

- ssbFrequency = 0
- MeasResultNR: phyCellId = 0 cellResults = empty

When this type of the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure is used, the

UE is not expected to send any A4 measurement reports. This is expected to last until

the UE needs the SCG.

This type of Secondary Node Release procedure is observed on the Secondary Node as a

normal release.

Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

### 3.10.5 UE Released to Idle Mode

When the UE is released to RRC\_IDLE mode by the Master Node, resources

in the Secondary Node are released. This is triggered in the Secondary Node at the

reception of the XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message sent by the Master

Node.

### 3.10.6 PDU Session Resource Setup Procedure

During the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure, resources over the Uu and NG-C

interfaces are assigned for one or more PDU sessions and their corresponding QoS flows.

The procedure aims to set up DRBs corresponding to the QoS flows for a given UE.

Connected Mode with NR-DC Not Configured

Based on the configured 5QI and ARP values of each QoS flow in a PDU session, the

following cases occur:

- If the new PDU session is allowed to be Secondary Node terminated, the Master Node either starts one of the following types of buffer monitoring or configures the UE to start A4 measurements: Downlink RLC buffer monitoring Uplink buffer monitoring Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring
- If the new PDU session is not allowed to be Secondary Node terminated by configuration, the Master Node takes no action related to NR-DC at reception of the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message.

Connected Mode with NR-DC Configured

If the new PDU sessions are allowed to be Secondary Node terminated based on the

configured 5QI and

the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) values of each QoS

flow in the PDU sessions, the Master Node initiates the Secondary Node Modification

procedure. The procedure is used to set up the PDU sessions with Secondary Node

terminated QoS flows in the Secondary Node.

The PDU sessions that are not allowed to be Secondary Node terminated are set up as

Master Node terminated ones.

When a Master Node terminated PDU session is set up with a QoS flow that changes the

UE group of a UE configured with NR-DC, a different configuration without NR-DC

might be applied to the UE.

### 3.10.7 PDU Session Resource Modify Procedure

During the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure, the AMF requests the Master Node to

modify the already existing PDU sessions for a given UE. The procedure is used to set

up, modify or release a QoS flow within an established PDU session.

A PDU session is modified to be allowed to be Secondary Node terminated by releasing QoS

flows that prevent Secondary Node termination by configuration. A PDU session is

modified not to be allowed to be Secondary Node terminated by adding QoS flows that

prevent Secondary Node termination by configuration.

Connected Mode with NR-DC Not Configured

Based on the configured QoS flow in a PDU session, the following cases can occur:

- The Master Node either starts buffer monitoring or configures the UE to start A4 measurements if the following conditions are met: A4 measurements or the following types of buffer monitoring are not already ongoing: Downlink RLC buffer monitoring Uplink buffer monitoring Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring A PDU session becomes allowed to be Secondary Node terminated by releasing or modifying QoS flows.
- When no PDU session is allowed to be Secondary Node terminated any longer by adding or successfully modifying QoS flows, the ongoing A4 measurement continues until the measurement time is up. However, A4 measurements are not restarted after that.

Connected Mode with NR-DC Configured

Based on the configured QoS flow in a PDU session, the following cases can occur:

- When QoS flows are added to already established PDU sessions, the following restrictions apply: If the established PDU session is Master Node terminated, newly added QoS flows are always Master Node terminated, regardless of the configuration of 5QI and ARP. If the established PDU session is Secondary Node terminated, newly added QoS flows are always Secondary Node terminated, regardless of the configuration of the 5QI and ARP. When a QoS flow is added to prevent Secondary Node termination in a Secondary Node terminated PDU session, the PDU session remains Secondary Node terminated. The Secondary Node applies the modified QoS properties based on the received information from the Master Node.
- When the last QoS flow that prevents the PDU session from being Secondary Node terminated is released, the PDU session remains Master Node terminated and no action is taken. Such PDU sessions remain to be Master Node terminated until the next time NR-DC is configured.
- When the QoS properties of a QoS flow are modified in established PDU sessions, the following restrictions apply: If the established PDU session is Master Node terminated, newly modified QoS flows are always Master Node terminated, regardless of the modification of QoS properties of the PDU session. If the established PDU session is Secondary Node terminated, newly modified QoS flows are always Secondary Node terminated, regardless of the modification of QoS properties of the PDU session. When a QoS flow is modified to prevent Secondary Node termination in a Secondary Node terminated PDU session, the PDU session remains Secondary Node terminated. The Secondary Node applies the modified QoS properties based on the received information from the Master Node. When the QoS properties of the last QoS flow that prevents the PDU session from being Secondary Node terminated are modified, the PDU session remains Master Node terminated and no action is taken. Such PDU sessions remain to be Master Node terminated until the next time NR-DC is configured.

Figure 12   Setting Up and Releasing QoS Flow for Secondary Node Terminated PDU

Session

When a QoS flow is added or removed to a Master Node terminated PDU session that

changes the UE group of a UE configured with NR-DC, a different configuration

without NR-DC might be applied to the UE.

### 3.10.8 PDU Session Resource Release Procedure

During the PDU Session Resource Release procedure, resources of established PDU sessions

are released for a given UE.

Connected Mode with NR-DC Not Configured

If the released PDU session was the last that was allowed to be Secondary Node

terminated, any ongoing A4 measurement continues until the measurement time is up.

However, A4 measurements are not restarted after that.

If a subset of PDU sessions is released and the evaluation of the A4 measurement

criteria is successful, for example, as a result of a UE group change, the Master

Node configures the UE to start A4 measurements or one of the following types of

buffer monitoring:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring
- Uplink buffer monitoring
- Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

Connected Mode with NR-DC Configured

If a subset of Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions are to be released for a UE

configured with NR-DC, the Master Node initiates the Secondary Node Modification

procedure. The procedure is used to release Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions

in Secondary Node.

When all Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions are

released, resources in the Secondary Node are released at the reception of the

XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message sent by the Master Node. The A4

measurement criteria and the conditions for downlink RLC or uplink buffer monitoring

are evaluated again in the Master Node. If the evaluation is successful, the Master

Node configures the UE to start A4 measurements or one of the following types of

buffer monitoring:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring
- Uplink buffer monitoring
- Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

Figure 13   Release of the Last Secondary Node Terminated PDU Session

When a Master Node or Secondary Node terminated PDU session is terminated, the UE

group of a UE configured with NR-DC might change. In this

case,

a different configuration without NR-DC might be applied to the UE.

link break is caused by locking the termination point of the Xn interface on the Master

Node.

### 3.10.10 Outgoing Intra-System Handover from the Source Cell

At all types of outgoing intra-system handover from the source cell on the Master Node,

the Master Node initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure as part of the handover

execution.

Related Information

Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

### 3.10.11 Incoming Handover into a New PCell

At incoming handover into a new PCell, the Master Node

evaluates the NR-DC criteria if the NR-DC-specific UE capabilities are known in the new

PCell.

The NR-DC-specific UE capabilities are not known in the new NR-DC-capable PCell in the

following cases, when the UE moves to the PCell from a non-NR-DC-capable cell for the

first time:

- After UE registration to the 5GC
- After incoming IRAT handover from LTE

Therefore, the NR-DC setup criteria are not met. The NR-DC setup criteria are checked

again when the UE connects to the network the next time, or when a subsequent handover

is performed to another NR-DC-capable cell.

If the NR-DC-specific UE capabilities are known in the new PCell, and the following

conditions are fulfilled, the target Master Node starts the buffer monitoring

function:

- All criteria for starting an A4 measurement are met.
- The value of at least one of the following attributes is greater than 0: NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr UlBufferMonCfg.ulBsVolThresh
- In the case of NG- or Xn-based inter-gNodeB handover, the UE is not configured with NR-DC before the handover.
- In the case of intra-gNodeB handover, high buffer status is not set.
- No high buffer status either in downlink or uplink is set.

If the conditions are met, the Master Node can start the following types of buffer

monitoring:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring
- Uplink buffer monitoring
- Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

If both downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring are enabled, whichever

buffer monitoring results in setting the high buffer status first, triggers the NR-DC

setup.

Otherwise, if downlink RLC or uplink buffer monitoring is

not requested, the Master Node evaluates if the following conditions for immediate NR-DC

setup are fulfilled:

- The UE is configured with NR-DC in the source PCell.
- No UE capability enquiry procedure is triggered in the target PCell.
- A candidate PSCell can be selected based on SCG measurement results reported by the UE. The candidate PSCell is either the same PSCell used before the handover, or a new PSCell on the same frequency with better radio link quality.
- The selected PSCell is a valid candidate PSCell. The selected PSCell is a valid candidate PSCell if it fulfills the following criteria: The measured RSRP level of the PSCell is above the A4 threshold configured through the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate attribute. If the NRFreqRelation.nrdcA4ThrRsrpFreqOffset attribute is set to a value other than 0, the frequency offset value is added to the value of the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate attribute. The reported PCI can be mapped to an existing ExternalNRCellCU MO instance that represents the PSCell candidate on the measured High-Band frequency. The MO is a child of the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO that represents the target Secondary Node in the MO structure of the Master Node. An NRCellRelation MO instance exists between the ExternalNRCellCU MO instance that represents the target PSCell and the NRCellCU MO instance that represents the serving PCell on the Master Node.Note: The NRCellRelation MO instance between the NRCellCU and ExternalNRCellCU MOs must be created manually. A connection over the Xn interface exists between the Master Node that hosts the PCell and the Secondary Node that hosts the target PSCell candidate. The connection is represented by a TermPointToGNodeB MO instance. The MO is a child of the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO that represents the Secondary Node in the MO structure of the Master Node. For the connection to be functional, the TermPointToGNodeB.administrativeState attribute must be set to UNLOCKED and the TermPointToGNodeB.operationalState attribute must display ENABLED.

If the conditions for immediate NR-DC setup are met, the target Master Node initiates the

Secondary Node Addition procedure toward the Secondary Node that hosts the selected

candidate PSCell.

NR-DC setup and NR-DC PSCell change to a barred or reserved cell is rejected.

If the conditions for immediate NR-DC setup are not met, the target Master Node

configures the UE to perform A4 measurements to find a candidate PSCell, and initiate

the Secondary Node Addition procedure after the handover is completed.

### 3.10.13 Measurement Gap Addition in the Master Node

The measurement gap is added in the Master Node for measurements that require it. If

NR-DC is configured, the Master Node uses the Master Node initiated Secondary Node

Modification procedure to indicate the configured measurement gap to the Secondary Node.

Because of this, the Secondary Node does not schedule user data during the measurement

gap that is added in the Master Node.

### 3.10.15 Measurement Gap Removal in the Master Node

The measurement gap is removed in the Master Node if the last measurement that requires a

measurement gap is removed. If NR-DC is configured, the Master Node uses the Master Node

initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure to inform the Secondary Node that the

measurement gap is removed.

values are forwarded to the Master Node.

In this case, the purpose of the Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Release

procedure is to prevent COUNT wrap-around.

### 3.11.5 High-Band Uplink Radio Link Quality Falls Below Configured Threshold in the PSCell

If the High-Band uplink radio link quality falls below a configured threshold in the

PSCell, the Secondary Node initiates the Secondary Node Modification procedure to change

the uplink primary path from SCG to MCG.

The uplink PDCP aggregation is disabled when the primary uplink path is set to MCG after

switching from the SCG to the MCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split

DRB.

apply, the Secondary Node initiates the Secondary Node Modification

procedure to change the uplink primary path from MCG to SCG:

- The primary uplink path for the transmission of PDCP PDUs is MCG.
- The transmission of PDCP PDUs in uplink is active.
- The UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ulPdcpScgRetProhibitTime timer is not running.

When a UE that is configured with an A3 measurement and connected with NR-DC reports that

the radio link quality of a High-Band cell in a neighboring gNodeB becomes better than

the serving PSCell, the UE sends the A3 measurement report that contains the PCI of a

High-Band cell that has better coverage.

The source Secondary Node evaluates the PCI of the reported High-Band cells, as

follows:

- If the reported PCI is a known external neighbor and PSCell change to the reported cell is allowed, intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change is triggered.
- The A3 measurement report is ignored if the PCI is unknown or it is a known internal neighbor.

### 3.11.12 Critical Coverage or Poor Radio Link Quality Detected by the UE in the PSCell

When a UE that is configured with an A2 measurement and connected with NR-DC reports

critical PSCell coverage, or poor radio link quality is detected, the Secondary Node

initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure for the UE.

## 3.12 NR-DC Procedures

### 3.12.1 Secondary Node Addition

The Secondary Node Addition procedure establishes a UE context in the Secondary Node.

This way, the Secondary Node can provide SCG and PDCP resources to the NR-DC-capable

UE.

During the Secondary Node Addition procedure, PDU sessions that are allowed to be

Secondary Node-terminated by configuration are moved to the Secondary Node. The

following changes are applied:

- All DRBs in the PDU session are reconfigured from Master Node terminated MCG DRBs to Secondary Node terminated split DRBs, while keeping the same DRB ID.
- New RLC and MAC entities are established for the Secondary Node terminated split DRBs in the Secondary Node. In the Master Node, the following options are available: The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is performed without an intra-cell handover. The RLC entity in the Master Node is reestablished by releasing the old RLC bearer and setting up a new RLC bearer for the reconfigured DRB. The PDCP is always reestablished when this option is used. This option is used when the number of the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs plus twice the number of the DRBs that are reconfigured from Master Node terminated to Secondary Node terminated is less than or equal to eight. The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is performed with an intra-cell handover. In this case, an intra-cell handover is performed in the Master Node to reestablish the RLC entities of the reconfigured DRBs. The DRBs are released and added again for the UE without PDCP re-establishment. This option is only used when the number of the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs plus twice the number of the DRBs that are reconfigured from Master Node terminated to Secondary Node terminated is greater than eight.
- The security key is changed from the master key to the secondary key.
- Downlink packet forwarding is performed over the Xn-U interface.
- Any ongoing A4 measurements stop.

Figure 14   Sequence of Secondary Node Addition

1. The NR-DC-capable UE sends an A4 measurement report to the Master Node in the RRC MeasurementReport message. When the A4 measurement report is received, the Master Node evaluates if all the conditions for the Secondary Node Addition procedure are met. If all the conditions are met, the Master Node initiates the Secondary Node Addition procedure to the Secondary Node that hosts the reported candidate PSCell on a High-Band frequency.
2. The Master Node sends the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message to the Secondary Node over the Xn-C interface. The message contains the following information: The request to set up one or several PDU sessions terminated by the Secondary NodeNote: For existing PDU sessions, the Master Node forwards information on the contained QoS flows and the NG-U uplink TEID. The secondary key to be used in the Secondary Node The UE capabilities including the complete list of band combinations reported by the UE The list of allowed NR-DC band combinations The PSCell candidate, or candidates, selected by the Master Node When the message is received, and if more than one PSCell candidate is provided, the Secondary Node uses only the first PSCell candidate received from the Master Node for PSCell selection.
3. The Secondary Node send the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the Master Node. The message contains the following information: The NG-U downlink TEID for each PDU session with QoS flows that are chosen to be Secondary Node terminated The request to prepare MCG radio resources for the DRBs to be reconfigured as split, based on the Xn-U uplink TEIDs provided by the Secondary Node TEIDs provided by the Secondary Node for downlink packet forwarding for each DRB The CG-Config message containing the selected band combination and feature set, including the PSCell and possible SCells of the SCG.
4. The Master Node sends the XnAP XN-U ADDRESS INDICATION message to the Secondary Node. The message contains the Xn-U downlink TEIDs for the DRBs to be reconfigured as split. The DRBs to be reconfigured as split are suspended in the Master Node.
5. The Master Node can send the XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the Secondary Node for AM DRBs. The message is used to forward the PDCP COUNT values. The PDCP COUNT value is reset to 0 if the user plane integrity protection status is different between the Master and Secondary Nodes. The DRBs to be reconfigured as split are suspended and downlink packet forwarding starts.
6. The Master Node sends the RRC RRCReconfiguration message to the UE over the Uu interface. The message includes information about the MCG and the SCG. All configured A4 measurement objects are removed from the UE configuration.
7. Random access is performed in the PCell, depending on whether an intra-cell handover is used.
8. The UE send the RRC RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the Master Node. The UE can start sending uplink user data in the MCG using the secondary key in the relocated PDCP.
9. The Master Node sends the XnAP S-NODE RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message to the Secondary Node over the Xn-C interface. The message contains information on the successful UE reconfiguration. The DRBs reconfigured as split resume in the Secondary Node. The Secondary Node can start sending downlink user data in the MCG using the secondary key in the relocated PDCP.
10. The UE performs the random access procedure in the PSCell. After a successful random access procedure, the Secondary Node can send and receive user data in the SCG using the secondary key.
11. The Master Node sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message to the AMF over the NG-C interface to provide the NG-U downlink TEID that is used by the UPF. After the path update, the UPF starts sending downlink user data to the Secondary Node.
12. The AMF confirms the path update by sending the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM message to the Master Node.

The following messages in the sequence are initiated in parallel:

- XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER
- RRC RRCReconfiguration
- NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION

### 3.12.4 Uplink Information Transfer and RRC Transfer

The Uplink Information Transfer and the RRC Transfer procedures have the following

purposes:

- The Uplink Information Transfer procedure is used to transfer MR-DC-dedicated information from the UE to the Master Node. The RRC MeasurementReport messages are transferred this way from the UE to the Master Node.
- The RRC Transfer procedure is used to forward encapsulated RRC messages by the Master Node from the UE to the Secondary Node.

- To change the SCG configuration in UE from one Secondary Node to another Secondary Node.

Figure 18   Sequence of Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Change

1. When intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change is triggered, the source Secondary Node sends the XnAP S-NODE CHANGE REQUIRED message to the Master Node.
2. The PSCell Change procedure to the target PSCell on the neighbor gNodeB is accepted in the Master Node if the following requirements are fulfilled: The reported PCI can be mapped to an existing ExternalNRCellCU MO instance that represents the PSCell candidate on the measured High-Band frequency. The MO is a child of the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO that represents the target Secondary Node in the MO structure of the Master Node. An NRCellRelation MO instance exists between the ExternalNRCellCU MO instance that represents the target PSCell and the NRCellCU MO instance that represents the serving PCell on the Master Node.Note: The NRCellRelation MO instance between the NRCellCU and ExternalNRCellCU MOs must be created manually. A connection over the Xn interface exists between the Master Node that hosts the PCell and the Secondary Node that hosts the target PSCell candidate. The connection is represented by a TermPointToGNodeB MO instance. The MO is a child of the ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO that represents the Secondary Node in the MO structure of the Master Node. For the connection to be functional, the TermPointToGNodeB.administrativeState attribute must be set to UNLOCKED and the TermPointToGNodeB.operationalState attribute must display ENABLED. If the requirements are fulfilled, the Master Node triggers Secondary Node Addition by sending the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message to the target Secondary Node that hosts the target PSCell.
3. The Secondary Node responds by sending the XnAP S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the Master Node.
4. The Master Node sends the XnAP XN-U ADDRESS INDICATION message to the target Secondary Node.
5. The Master Node sends the XnAP S-NODE CHANGE CONFIRM message to the source Secondary Node.
6. The Master Node reconfigures the UE by sending the RRC RRCReconfiguration message. The message includes information about the MCG and the SCG.

8. The UE responds to the Master Node by sending the RRC RRCReconfigurationComplete message.
9. The Master Node sends the XnAP S-NODE RECONFIGURATON COMPLETE message to the target Secondary Node.
10. The source Secondary Node sends the Secondary Node status by using the XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the Master Node. The downlink packet forwarding is started from the source Secondary Node to the target Secondary Node.

### 3.12.7 Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

The Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure triggers the release of the UE

context at the Secondary Node.

The Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure is triggered by one of the

following scenarios:

- The UE detects RLF in the SCG.
- Any type of intra-system handover is performed from the source cell on the Master Node.
- IRAT inter-system handover is performed from the source cell on the Master Node.
- The UE group change of a UE to a group for which NR-DC is not enabled, triggered by one of the following procedures: PDU Session Resource Setup procedure PDU Session Resource Modify procedure PDU Session Resource Release procedure for a Master Node terminated PDU session

At the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure, Secondary Node terminated

PDU sessions are moved to the Master Node. The following changes are applied:

- All DRBs in the PDU session are reconfigured from Secondary Node terminated split DRBs to Master Node terminated MCG DRBs keeping the same DRB ID.
- RLC and MAC entities established at the Secondary Node Addition procedure are released for the DRBs to be reconfigured from Secondary Node terminated into Master Node terminated. In the Master Node, the following options are available: The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is performed without an intra-cell handover The RLC entity in the Master Node is reestablished by releasing the old RLC bearer and setting up a new RLC bearer for the reconfigured DRB. The PDCP is always reestablished when this option is used. This option is used when the number of the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs plus twice the number of the DRBs that are reconfigured from Secondary Node terminated to Master Node terminated is less than or equal to eight. The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is performed with an intra-cell handover In this case, an intra-cell handover is performed in the Master Node to reestablish the RLC entities of the reconfigured DRBs. The DRBs are released and added again for the UE without PDCP reestablishment. This option is only used in either of the following cases: When the number of the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs plus twice the number of the DRBs that are reconfigured from Secondary Node terminated to Master Node terminated is greater than eight. At least one UM DRB is reconfigured from Secondary Node terminated into Master Node terminated.
- The security key is changed from the secondary key to the master key.
- Downlink packet forwarding is performed over the Xn-U interface. Note: If the Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedure was triggered by the IRAT inter-system handover procedure, downlink packet forwarding is performed over the X2-U interface.
- If all the criteria for starting an A4 measurement are met, the Master Node either starts one of the following types of buffer monitoring or configures the UE to start A4 measurements: Downlink RLC buffer monitoring Uplink buffer monitoring Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

The message contains the following information: The list of PDU sessions with Secondary Node terminated QoS flows to be released. Information on the QoS flows that the Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions contain. The request for downlink packet forwarding.
3. The Master Node sends the XnAP XN-U ADDRESS INDICATION message to the Secondary Node with information on TEIDs for packet forwarding. When the message is received, the downlink packet forwarding starts.
4. The Secondary Node can send the XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the Master Node for AM DRBs. The message is used to forward the PDCP COUNT values. The PDCP COUNT value is reset to 0 if the user plane integrity protection status is different between the Master and Secondary Nodes.

6. Optionally, random access is performed in the PCell. This depends on whether an intra-cell handover is used or not.
7. The UE responds to the Master Node by sending the RRC RRCReconfigurationComplete message. The Master Node can start sending and receiving user data using the master key in the relocated PDCP. After the UE reconfiguration is confirmed, the DRBs reconfigured as Master Node terminated resume in the Master Node.
8. The Master Node sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message to the AMF over the NG-C interface to provide the new NG-U downlink TEID that is used by the UPF. After the path update, the UPF starts sending downlink user data to the Master Node.
9. The AMF confirms the path update by responding to the Master Node with the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM message.
10. The Master Node requests the Secondary Node to release all the SCG resources for the UE by sending the XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message over the Xn-C interface to the Secondary Node.

### 3.12.8 Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

The Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Release procedure triggers the release of the

UE context at the Secondary Node.

following scenarios:

- The Secondary Node detects RLF.
- The PSCell or the underlying sector carrier is locked.
- The random access timer expires in the Secondary Node.

# 4 Network Impact of NR-NR Dual Connectivity

The feature affects data throughput, retainability, and UE battery life. The feature

introduces and adds information to signaling messages over external interfaces.

Capacity and Performance

Data throughput for the UE is expected to increase when Secondary Node terminated

split DRBs are used. This is because the SCG provides increased bandwidth with

High-Band frequencies. When using the Secondary Node terminated split DRB, the

following impact can be expected on Master Node and Secondary Node traffic:

- Data traffic volume over the Secondary Node to the UE increases. The level of increase is lower if one of the following types of buffer monitoring is enabled: Downlink RLC buffer monitoring Uplink buffer monitoring Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring
- Data traffic volume over the Master Node to the UE might decrease as most of the traffic flows through the SCG.
- Total user throughput might increase.
- Signaling is expected to increase over the following interfaces: The NG-C interface between the Master Node and the 5GC The Uu interface between the Master Node and the UE The Xn-C interface between the Master Node and the Secondary Node

With the activation of the feature, impact on retainability can be expected. At

feature activation, both the Master Node with the feature activated and the neighbor

gNodeBs without the feature start requesting NR-DC-specific UE capabilities. The

increased number of RRC UECapabilityEnquiry messages sent to UEs

occurs for one of the following reasons:

- The AMF does not support storing or updating UE capabilities.
- The UE uses an RRC protocol version earlier than 15.6.0. Such UEs are not able to indicate if NR-DC-specific capabilities were already requested by the network.

The impact on retainability can affect the network in the following ways:

- An increase in the network load can be expected because of the frequent requests for NR-DC-specific UE capabilities.
- The risk of dropping the connection increases for UEs that are at the cell edge or in bad radio conditions.

For intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change, the following benefits are

expected:

- The number of abnormal Secondary Node releases for UEs that are caused by RLF can be reduced, which improves retainability.
- Improved end user performance and data throughput is expected because of the following factors: The UE spends less time in the SCG with poor radio link quality. The UE can continue to use the higher bit rates of High-Band frequencies in an SCG with good radio link quality. The PSCell change for the UE results in no packet loss.

With the configuration of the following types of buffer monitoring,

NR-DC setup is triggered based on the UE traffic level:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring
- Uplink buffer monitoring
- Downlink RLC and uplink buffer monitoring

This decreases the number of unnecessary NR-DC setups. A4 measurement

configuration is delayed until the UE traffic is higher than the configured

threshold. When the UE traffic is lower than the configured threshold, NR-DC is not

configured for the UE.

Uplink UE throughput and Secondary Node resource utilization can be

improved as compared to the case when only downlink RLC buffer monitoring is used.

This way UEs with low downlink data volume but high uplink data volume can be

configured with NR-DC.

When downlink carrier aggregation is used on the Master Node before

NR-DC is configured and SCells are activated to carry traffic, the probability of a

high buffer report decreases. As a result, the probability to set up NR-DC

decreases.

When Master Node-based handover is performed with an immediate

Secondary Node Addition procedure, the following impact is expected:

- Capacity on the Secondary Node can slightly decrease for UEs configured with NR-DC. This might result in the rejection of the Secondary Node Addition procedure at NR-DC setup and when the Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Change procedure is requested. As a result, capacity on serving High-Band frequencies decreases when the Secondary Node Addition is rejected at the handover. Note: The capacity decrease also applies to UEs configured with EN-DC for the same reason at EN-DC setup and when the Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Change procedure is requested.
- Control plane latency slightly increases at the handover because of the increased number of messages over the Xn-C interface.
- Interruption time for the UE configured with NR-DC is minimized for user plane transmissions in the SCG.
- RRC signaling is reduced between the Master Node and the UE.

If A4 measurements contain multiple High-Band frequencies as

measurement objects, UEs that are configured with NR-DC can be distributed among

multiple PSCells if in coverage. This might result in the full capacity use of a

Secondary Node, in terms of the maximum number of RRC-connected UEs. The time to

report might increase for the UE.

Releasing the Secondary Node causes a reduction in UE throughput. For UEs with an

ongoing high throughput transmission this can cause an increase in Master Node queue

length. This can lead to an increased number of packets discarded by the AQM.

Other Network Elements

Higher UE battery consumption is expected when NR-DC-capable UEs perform A4

measurements or use the Secondary Node resources.

UE battery life is extended when the UE indicates the release of the

Secondary Node when not using SCG resources while connected in NR-DC.

UE battery consumption can be reduced by using the following types of

buffer monitoring:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring

# 7 Activate NR-NR Dual Connectivity

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed both in the Master Node and the Secondary Node.
- The conflicting features are deactivated on the Master Node and the Secondary Node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012582 MO instance on both the Master Node and the Secondary Node.

When the feature is activated, to enable the use of NR-DC for UEs in the PCell on

the Master Node:

2. Set the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcEnabled attribute to true.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR-NR Dual Connectivity

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcEnabled attribute to false in the PCell on the Master Node.
2. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012582 MO instance on both the Master Node and the Secondary Node.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## 9.1 Configure IP Connectivity in NR-DC for the Xn-U Interface

In NR-DC, the user plane connection between the Master Node and the Secondary Node is

established over the Xn-U interface.

Prerequisites

Separate LocalIpEndpoint MO instances exist on both the Master

Node and on the Secondary Node. On the Master Node, the MO is under the

EndpointResource MO, which is a child to the

GNBDUFunction MO. On the Secondary Node, the MO is under the

EndpointResource MO, which is a child to the

GNBCUUPFunction MO.

Steps

1. Configure the LocalIpEndpoint.addressRef attribute on the Master Node to reference an instance of either the AddressIPv4 or AddressIPv6 MO. The Master Node uses the configured IP address for local transport network endpoints for the user plane connection.
2. Add the F1 value to the list in the LocalIpEndpoint.interfaceList attribute on the Master Node. The Xn-U interface uses the IP address referenced in the LocalIpEndpoint.addressRef attribute on the Master Node to connect to the Secondary Node.
3. Configure the LocalIpEndpoint.addressRef attribute on the Secondary Node to reference an instance of either the AddressIPv4 or AddressIPv6 MO. The Secondary Node uses the configured IP address for local transport network endpoints for the user plane connection.
4. Add the XN value to the list in the LocalIpEndpoint.interfaceList attribute on the Secondary Node. The Xn-U interface uses the IP address referenced in the LocalIpEndpoint.addressRef attribute on the Secondary Node to connect to the Master Node.

Results

The IP addresses to connect the nodes in NR-DC over the Xn-U interface are

defined.

After This Task

Both the Master Node and the Secondary Node need to be restarted, so that the IP

address configuration can take

effect.

## 9.2 TCP Optimization for Secondary Node Terminated Split DRB in NR-DC

TCP optimization provides reduced queuing delay in downlink user plane traffic to improve

end user performance. For TCP optimization of Secondary Node terminated DRBs, the Active

Queue Management (AQM) is primarily active in the PDCP SDU queue and is partially

available also in the Radio Link Control (RLC) SDU queue in the gNodeB. The AQM is only

applied for each bearer and only to downlink user traffic in NR-DC.

The AQM mode in the PDCP SDU queue and the RLC SDU queue is set through the

AqmCfg.aqmMode attribute under the

GNBCUUPFunction MO class and theGNBDUFunction

MO class respectively, and are recommended to be configured the same value. The AQM mode

can have one of the following values:

## 9.3 Configuration Options Related to NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces support for UE

group-differentiated user plane configuration and enhancements for downlink cell group

switching and AQM.

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile introduces and deprecates attributes, which

affect this feature.

For more information, see NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile.

### 9.3.1 Deprecation Handling

The following attributes are introduced for deprecation handling:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled

The GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled and the

GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attributes control

whether the legacy or the updated MOM configuration is used.

If the following attributes are set to false, legacy attributes are used

with deprecation handling:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled

If the following attributes are set to true, the introduced MOM

configuration is used:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled

Node restart is required after both changes.

Backwards Compatible Changes

For backwards compatibility, the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is used and

by default it is set to true.

All deprecated attribute values are copied from the NRCellDU MO

instances to the replacement attributes in the CgSwitchCfg MO

instances.

When normal deprecation handling is enabled, the MO instance of the introduced MO

class corresponding to the NRCellDU MO instance is automatically

deleted or created.

When normal deprecation handling is enabled, and the operator creates an

NRCellDU MO instance, instances of the following MO classes

must not be created manually:

- CgSwitch
- CgSwitchCfg
- CgSwitchUeCfg
- UeCC

If the operator wants to create instances of these MO classes together with

NRCellDU MO instances in the same transaction, the creation

of the NRCellDU MO instance must be ordered after the creation of

the listed MO classes.

Normal deprecation handling only works for NRCellDU MO instances

that are mapped to one CgSwitch MO instance, and if the number of

CgSwitch MO instances is at most 48. When an

NRCellDU MO instance is created, but there is no

CgSwitch MO instance left, deprecation handling is not

applied for that cell. Therefore, default values are used instead for the following

attributes:

- NRCellDU.endcDlLegSwitchEnabled
- NRCellDU.endcDlNrLowQualThresh
- NRCellDU.endcDlNrQualHyst

It is possible to control which configuration to use for each

NRCellDU instance by setting the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute to

false, even when more than 48 NRCellDU MO

instances are created. There is still a limitation of having 48 plus one

CgSwitch MO instances for configuration. Additionally, UE

grouping is only supported when the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to

false.

Figure 22 shows normal deprecation

handling.

Figure 22   Normal Deprecation Handling

It is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in the

CgSwitchCfg MO class if the class is available in the

Management System.

It is recommended to update the attribute values in the introduced MO classes first,

when deprecation handling is disabled and the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to

false.

Disabling deprecation handling prevents attributes in the

CgSwitchCfg MO instance from being overwritten in the

introduced management system versions. In these use cases, the

CgSwitchCfg MO instance is visible and used instead of the

deprecated attributes.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes

Changes in the following MO classes are non-backwards compatible because of the

reduced cardinality of the introduced MO classes:

- AqmCfg
- DcDlCfg
- Drb
- DrbUeCfg
- UserPlaneProfile
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg

Therefore, it is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in these MO

classes if they are available in the Management System.

If the change to the introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the

deprecation window ends, default values are applied if no configuration is

provided.

Figure 23 and Figure 24 show alternative deprecation

handling, when the altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute is set

to true.

deprecation window ends and no configuration is provided, the default values are

used for these attributes.

### 9.3.2 Migration Information

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces attributes and MO

classes for UE group-differentiated user plane configuration, for downlink cell group

switching, and for AQM.

MO classes and attributes are introduced under the GNBCUUPFunction and

the GNBDUFunction MO classes to support the introduced

functionalities. These classes and attributes co-exist with deprecated attributes.

Therefore, the migration to the introduced attributes is recommended.

Guidelines for Migration from the GNBCUUPFunction MO Class to

the UserPlaneProfile MO Class

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- There is a single instance of the UserPlaneProfile MO class.
- The attribute values defined under the UserPlaneProfileUeCfg=Base MO instance are applied to all 5QIs and QCIs.

Table 25   Mapping between Legacy and Introduced Attributes under the

GNBCUUPFunction MO Class

| Legacy Attribute                       | Introduced Attribute                           |

Guidelines for Migration from the CUUP5qi MO Class to the

Drb and the UserPlaneProfile MO

Classes

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- The CUUP5qi.drbRef attribute must reference a Drb MO instance.
- The DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance and a DcDlCfg MO instance.
- Two or more CUUP5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single Drb MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances being used for such CUUP5qi MO instances.
- Different Drb instances with a child DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM and PDCP settings. This results in different AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances.
- Automatically created Drb MO instances can be referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance.
- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DcDlCfg DrbUeCfg
- Manually created instances of L4sCfg MO class can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi instance.

Guidelines for Migration from the DU5qi MO Class to the

DrbUp MO Class

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- The DU5qi.drbUpRef attribute must reference a DrbUp MO instance.
- The DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance.
- Two or more DU5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single DrbUp MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg MO instance being used for any DU5qi MO instances.
- Different DrbUp MO instances with a child DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM settings. Different AqmCfg MO instances are needed.
- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by any DU5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DrbUp DrbUpUeCfg

## 9.4 Configure 5QI and ARP Levels for QoS Flows Allowed to Be Secondary Node Terminated

By using different settings for each ARP and 5QI, operators can determine which QoS

flows are allowed to be Secondary Node terminated.

Prerequisites

- An instance of the NrdcSnTermination MO exists under the GNBCUCPFunction MO.
- The NrdcSnTermination.defaultNrdcSnTerm is set to false.
- An instance of NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg MO exists as the child of the NrdcSnTermination MO.
- An instance of the CUCP5qi MO is configured as a 5QI profile representing the configuration of a QoS flow.

Steps

1. Configure the CUCP5qi.nrdcSnTerminationRef attribute to contain a reference to the instance of the NrdcSnTermination MO.
2. Configure a value to the NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg.nrdcSnTermAllowed attribute that allows Secondary Node termination for an ARP or an ARP combination.

Results

This specific QoS flow is allowed to be terminated by the Secondary Node. The DRB

carrying this QoS flow is configured as a Secondary Node terminated split DRB.

## 9.5 Configuration Considerations for Switching of Uplink MCG and SCG Radio Resources of the Secondary Node-Terminated Split DRB

In deployments with a mix of EN-DC and NR-DC UEs, the value of the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute might have to be increased to avoid RLF for NR-DC UEs. By adjusting

the value of

the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute to be the most optimal for NR-DC, the uplink PDCP PDU transmission throughput

can be improved and maintained in variable High-Band radio conditions.

The following EBS counters provide observability for the switching of uplink MCG and SCG

radio resources of the

Secondary

Node-terminated

split DRB:

- The pmEbsNrdcPrimaryCgSwitchUlMcgTrigger$ counter increases when the estimated radio quality of the NR link on SCG is poor.
- The pmEbsNrdcPrimaryCgSwitchUlScgTrigger$ counter increases when the estimated radio quality of the NR link on SCG is good.

It is recommended to configure the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute to a value that is high enough to enable switching to the MCG radio resources

before the uplink SCG throughput becomes lower than the required uplink throughput.

## 9.6 Observability of NR-DC Setup Based on Uplink and Downlink Buffer Threshold Configuration

Observability in the changes in the feature performance when both the downlink RLC

and uplink buffer monitoring are used.

Table 28 shows the change in the values of PM

counters in the following cases:

- Downlink RLC buffer monitoring is configured when uplink buffer monitoring is not enabled.
- Uplink buffer monitoring is configured when downlink RLC buffer monitoring is already enabled.
- Uplink buffer monitoring is configured when downlink RLC buffer monitoring is not enabled.

### 9.7.1 Enabling NR-DC in the PCell at UE Group Change

The NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcEnabled attribute is used to enable the

NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature in the PCell.

During a UE group change, one of the following actions is done:

- If NR-DC was disabled in the previous UE group and it is enabled in the selected UE group and NR-DC is not configured, one of the following actions is taken by the Master Node: If downlink RLC buffer monitoring, uplink buffer monitoring, or both are configured in the selected UE group, the Master node starts the buffer monitoring function. If neither downlink RLC buffer monitoring, nor uplink buffer monitoring is configured in the selected UE group, the Master node configures the UE to perform A4 measurements according to the attribute setting. For more information on buffer monitoring, see Buffer Monitoring Behavior at UE Group Change.
- If NR-DC was enabled in the previous UE group and it is disabled in the selected UE group, one of the following actions is taken: If downlink RLC buffer monitoring, uplink buffer monitoring, or both are ongoing for the UE, they are stopped. For more information on buffer monitoring, see Buffer Monitoring Behavior at UE Group Change. If an A4 measurement is ongoing, it continues until the measurement period ends. The A4 measurement report is ignored when received. For more information on A4 measurements, see A4 Measurement Behavior at UE Group Change. If NR-DC is configured for the UE, the Master Node immediately initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure for the UE.

### 9.7.2 Buffer Monitoring Behavior at UE Group Change

The following attributes are used to configure the Downlink RLC Buffer Monitoring

function of the NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature:

- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr

The following attributes are used to configure the Uplink Buffer Monitoring function of

the NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature:

- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupUlBufferMonCfgRef
- UlBufferMonCfg.ulBsVolThresh

At UE group change, one of the following actions is done:

- If downlink RLC buffer monitoring, uplink buffer monitoring, or both are ongoing for the UE, one of the following actions is done: They are restarted with new threshold values. They are stopped, then the Master Node configures the UE to start an A4 measurement.
- If neither downlink RLC buffer monitoring, nor uplink buffer monitoring is ongoing for the UE, they can be started if they are configured in the selected UE group.

For more information on enabling or disabling NR-DC during a UE group change, see

Enabling NR-DC in the PCell at UE Group Change.

The CuCpNrdcSetupBufMonConfig PM event can be used to monitor when the buffer monitoring

type changes for a given UE. For example, if downlink RLC buffer monitoring is disabled

while uplink buffer monitoring is enabled for the UE during UE group change. The

pmEbsNrdcSetupMnBufMonConfig EBS counter is only stepped when

buffer monitoring is started for the first time for that UE. This is because one type of

buffer monitoring already started before the buffer monitoring type changes.

### 9.7.3 A4 Measurement Behavior at UE Group Change

The following attributes are used to configure A4 measurements:

- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.maxReportCells
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMeasTime
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMeasRestartTime
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate

During UE group change, if an A4 measurement is ongoing, it continues with the old A4

measurement configuration until the measurement period ends.

The new A4 measurement configuration takes effect the next time that an A4 measurement is

started or restarted.

### 9.7.4 Secondary Node Termination of QoS Flows at UE Group Change

The NrdcSnTerminationUeCfg.nrdcSnTermAllowed attribute is used to

configure the Secondary Node Termination of QoS Flows function of the NR-NR Dual

Connectivity feature.

During UE group change, one of the following actions is done:

- If NR-DC is configured, the ongoing NR-DC connection is not affected.
- If NR-DC is not configured and Secondary Node termination is allowed for at least one PDU session, one of the following actions is taken: If downlink RLC buffer monitoring, uplink buffer monitoring, or both are configured on the selected UE group but not started, the Master Node starts them. If neither downlink RLC buffer monitoring, nor uplink buffer monitoring is configured on the selected UE group and no A4 measurement is ongoing, the Master Node configures the UE to perform an A4 measurement.

### 9.7.5 Intra-Frequency Mobility Control in the Secondary Node at UE Group Change

The following attributes are used to configure the Intra-Frequency Mobility Control in

the Secondary Node function of the NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature:

- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.betterSpCellTriggerQuantity
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.maxReportCells
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpBetterSpCell
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqBetterSpCell
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.sinrBetterSpCell

During UE group change, the A3 measurement is reconfigured if the A3 settings change in

the Secondary Node during an ongoing connection because of a UE group change in the

Secondary Node.

### 9.7.6 A2 Measurement-Based Secondary Node Release for NR-DC at UE Group Change

During UE group change, the A2 measurement is reconfigured if the setting of any of the

A2 attributes change during an ongoing connection because of a UE group change in the

Secondary Node.

### 9.7.7 NR-DC Inactivity Supervision in the Secondary Node at UE Group Change

The InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimerNrdcSn attribute is used to

configure inactivity supervision in the Secondary Node.

If the value of the attribute changes because of a UE group change, the changed value

takes effect immediately.

Configuration of UE Group-Adapted NR-DC Functions

## 9.8 Recommended Configuration for Downlink RLC Buffer Monitoring

The Downlink RLC Buffer Monitoring function exists for both the NR-NR Dual

Connectivity feature and the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature.

It is not possible to have the Downlink RLC Buffer monitoring functions of both the NR-NR

Dual Connectivity and the NR Data-Aware Mobility features ongoing in the gNodeB at the

same time for the same UE.

If buffer monitoring is enabled for both features, and they are active in the same node,

the buffer monitoring of the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature might be blocked by the

buffer monitoring of the NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature. To avoid this, the following

configuration is required:

- The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktAgeThr attribute must be set to a higher value than the value of the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr attribute.
- The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktVolThr attribute must be set to a higher value than the value of the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr attribute.

## 9.9 Deprecation Handling

Deprecation handling is enabled by default.

The following backward compatible attributes are introduced to replace deprecated

attributes:

- The UlCgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode attribute replaces the NRCellDU.endcUlLegSwitchEnabled attribute.
- The UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute replaces the NRCellDU.endcUlNrLowQualThresh attribute.
- The UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst attribute replaces the NRCellDU.endcUlNrQualHyst attribute.
- The UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ulPdcpScgRetProhibitTime attribute replaces the GNBCUUPFunction.endcUlNrRetProhibTimer attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.initialUplinkConf attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThreshold attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThresholdMcg attribute.

The following attributes control deprecation handling:

- GNBCUCPFunction.servAapUPProfUlDepHEnabled
- GNBCUUPFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled

The default value of

the

attributes are

true, which means that deprecation

handling is enabled by default to support the automatic migration of the attributes. All

deprecated attribute values are copied from

the corresponding

attributes under the NRCellDU MO class to the

replacement attributes under the UlCgSwitchCfg MO

instances.

Figure 25   Deprecation Handling

If deprecation handling is enabled, the instance of the introduced MO class that

corresponds

to the NRCellDU MO instance is automatically deleted or created.

If deprecation handling is enabled, and the operator creates an

NRCellDU MO instance, instances of the following MO classes must

not be created manually:

- UlCgSwitch
- UlCgSwitchCfg
- UlCgSwitchUeCfg
- UeCC

To create instances of

the

MO classes together with NRCellDU MO instances in the same

transaction, the creation of the NRCellDU MO instance must be ordered

after the creation of the listed MO classes.

UE grouping is supported only if

the

value of the GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled attribute is

set to false.

It is recommended to configure the user plane attributes

under

the UlCgSwitchCfg MO class if the class is available in the

Management System.

It is recommended to update the attribute values in the introduced MO classes first, when

deprecation handling is disabled and

the

value of the GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled attribute is

set to false.

Disabling deprecation handling prevents attributes under the

UlCgSwitchCfg MO instance from being overwritten in the

introduced

Management

System versions. In these use cases, the

UlCgSwitchCfg MO instance is visible and used instead of the

deprecated attributes.

A migration script is provided to support an optional automated migration to the

introduced MOM structure of the Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature. The

migration script is a complement to the deprecation handling mechanism that handles the

deprecated attributes

under

the NRCellDU MO class.

## 9.10 Uplink Traffic Distribution between the MCG and the SCG

The traffic distribution between the MCG and the SCG can be adjusted.

The preference of throughput over latency can be tuned in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments

independently by adjusting the

low

quality threshold of uplink cell group

switching

through the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulSCGLowQualThresh

attribute. This configuration can be used when a High-Band cell group still provides

high throughput, but the latency suffers from fluctuations because of the poor uplink

quality.

The throughput can also be tuned in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments independently by

adjusting the low-quality threshold of uplink cell group switching through the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulSCGLowQualThresh attribute. This allows delayed

cell group switching to the MCG for deployments where the MCG has lower capacity.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q1: Switching of Uplink MCG and SCG Radio Resources of the Secondary Node Terminated Split DRB in NR-DC

The enhancement enables the switching of the uplink primary path for PDCP PDU

transmission of the Secondary Node terminated split DRBs based on the uplink radio quality

in the SCG.

| Feature Name:           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name:     | Peak Rate Evolution       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4005              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type:            | NR                        |

Summary and Benefits

By allowing the switching of the uplink primary path of Secondary Node terminated

split DRBs based on dynamic evaluation of the SCG uplink quality, the enhancement

provides the following benefits:

- It reduces the number of Secondary Node releases that are caused by SCG RLF for UEs that are configured with NR-DC.
- It maintains uplink PDCP PDU transmission throughput in variable High-Band radio conditions.

Capacity and Performance

The switching of the uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node

terminated split DRB improves Retainability for the Secondary Node in NR-DC.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the following attributes that are used to configure Xn

interface timers for NR-DC procedures:

- GNBCUCPFunction.tXnDcOverall
- GNBCUCPFunction.tXnDcPrep

The enhancement makes the following attributes applicable to configuring the uplink

MCG and SCG radio resource switching function of the LTE-NR Dual Connectivity

feature used in NR-DC:

- GNBCUUPFunction.endcUlNrRetProhibTimer
- NRCellDU.endcUlLegSwitchEnabled
- NRCellDU.endcUlNrLowQualThresh
- NRCellDU.endcUlNrQualHyst

The GNBCUUPFunction.pmProhibitTimerRefuseUlLegSwitch PM counter

can be used to monitor how many times the uplink radio resource switching to SCG

radio resources is rejected because of the

GNBCUUPFunction.endcUlNrRetProhibTimer attribute setting.

If the initial uplink primary path is SCG, the following PM counters in the Secondary

Node can decrease if switching of the uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the

Secondary Node terminated split DRB for NR-DC is used:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalMnInit
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalMnInitAct
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInit
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInitAct
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeUlResUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUeLate
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUeLastSlot
- NRCellDU.pmPuschSchedActivity
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAckQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtxQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNackQpsk
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktLossUlQos
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktLossUlToDiscQos
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktLossUlToQos
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpVolRecUlQos on the internal RpUserPlaneLink
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktRecUlQos on the internal RpUserPlaneLink
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktRecUlOooQos

If the initial uplink primary path is SCG, the following PM counters in the Master

Node can increase if switching of the uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the

Secondary Node terminated split DRB for NR-DC is used:

- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeUlResUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUeLate
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUeLastSlot
- NRCellDU.pmPuschSchedActivity
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAckQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtxQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNackQpsk

If the initial uplink primary path is SCG, the following PM counters in the Secondary

Node can increase if switching of the uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the

Secondary Node terminated split DRB for NR-DC is used:

- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpVolRecUlQos on the external RpUserPlaneLink
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktRecUlQos on the external RpUserPlaneLink

The enhancement introduces the following PM events:

- CuCpXnSNodeModificationConfirm
- CuCpXnSNodeModificationRefuse
- CuCpXnSNodeModificationRequest
- CuCpXnSNodeModificationRequestAcknowledge
- CuCpXnSNodeModificationRequestReject
- CuCpXnSNodeModificationRequired

The following PM events are used to monitor both the Master Node initiated Secondary

Node Modification and the Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedures:

- CuCpProcMnNrdcModification, which is monitored in the Master Node.
- CuCpProcSnNrdcModification, which is monitored in the Secondary Node.

The enhancement deprecates the CuCpProcNrdcModification PM

event.

The CuUpProcSnNrdcUlPrimaryCgSwitch PM event is used to monitor

the NR-DC switching of uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node

terminated split DRB procedure.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Interfaces

This change affects the following interfaces:

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

Summary and Benefits

Intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change moves the UE that is configured with

NR-DC from the serving PSCell that has poor radio link quality to a target PSCell

that has better radio link quality. This way, the number of Secondary Node releases

that are caused by RLF can be reduced for UEs that are configured with NR-DC.

Capacity and Performance

With this feature enhancement, the following benefits are expected:

- The number of abnormal Secondary Node releases for UEs that are caused by RLF can be reduced. This improves retainability.
- Improved end-user performance and data throughput is expected because of the following factors: The UE spends less time in the SCG with poor radio link quality. The UE can continue to use the higher bit rates of High-Band frequencies in an SCG with good radio link quality. The PSCell change for the UE results in no packet loss.

This feature enhancement has an impact on the following PIs:

- The NR-DC Inter-gNodeB PSCell Change Success Rate Captured on Secondary Node PI is expected to increase, because the user plane interruption time during which the UE moves from one High-Band cell to another is reduced.
- The NR-DC Release Abnormal Active Rate Captured on Secondary gNodeB PI is expected to decrease because of the decrease in the number of abnormal Secondary Node releases for NR-DC-capable UEs.

Operation

This feature enhancement makes the following attributes applicable to configuring A3

measurements on the Secondary Node in NR-DC:

- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.betterSpCellTriggerQuantity
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpBetterSpCellThe attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger
- IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqBetterSpCellThe attribute contains the following configurable members: hysteresis offset timeToTrigger

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to monitor

intra-frequency, inter-gNodeB PSCell change:

## Appendix A.c: 22.Q3: Secondary Node-Triggered SCG Reconfiguration and Improved Observability for Secondary Node Release in NR-DC

This feature enhancement introduces Secondary Node-triggered SCG reconfiguration for

the UE while it is connected in NR-DC. It also provides improved observability for the

Secondary Node Release procedure. Additionally, through this feature enhancement, the UE can

request the release of the Secondary Node when it does not use the SCG

resources.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005              |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node       |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

SCG reconfiguration of the UE connected with NR-DC is required in the following

cases:

- At uplink transmission port and waveform switch
- At CSI-RS configuration for wide beam support
- When the maximum number of scheduling requests is reached in the SCG.

Any of these cases triggers the Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node

Modification procedure with the purpose to reconfigure the SCG. This way, the number

of Secondary Node Releases caused by RLF is reduced.

UE battery life is extended when the UE requests the release of the Secondary Node as

SCG resources are released.

Capacity and Performance

NR-DC performance degradation can be avoided if the SCG used by the UE can be

reconfigured.

The value of the NR-DC Release Abnormal Active Rate Captured on Secondary gNodeB PI,

which is used for monitoring Secondary Node releases, decreases. This happens

because the value of the NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInit and

NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInitAct PM counters

decreases.

Table 30 shows the PM counters that can be

used to monitor when the UE sends the RRC SCGFailureInformation

message with special values to the Master Node to trigger a Master Node initiated

Secondary Node Release procedure.

Table 30   PM Counter Changes during the Secondary Node Release Procedure

| PM Counter                              | Change   |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnNormal            | Increase |
| NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInit    | Decrease |
| NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInitAct | Decrease |

Operation

An additional field that specifies the modification type is added to the

CuCpProcSnNrdcModification and

DuProcUeContextModification PM events.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

This change affects the following interfaces:

- Uu The RRC RRCReconfiguration message is updated with information on SCG reconfiguration. The RRC SCGFailureInformation message is updated with attributes of the measResultFreqList IE set to nil or empty. This triggers the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Release.
- Xn-C The XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUIRED and XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION CONFIRM messages are updated.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

## Appendix A.d: 22.Q3: Downlink Buffer-Based NR-DC Setup

Downlink RLC buffer monitoring allows operators to trigger the NR-DC setup based on

UE traffic level in the downlink RLC buffer.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005              |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type            | NR                        |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                  |

Summary and Benefits

For UEs with short data sessions, unnecessary NR-DC setups can be avoided using

downlink RLC buffer threshold configuration specific to operator needs. This way, UE

battery life can be extended and control signaling can be reduced.

This feature enhancement makes it possible to configure different downlink RLC

thresholds for different UE groups.

Capacity and Performance

With active downlink RLC buffer monitoring, the number of NR-DC setups is expected to

decrease for NR-DC-capable UEs.

Lower traffic level is expected in the SCG because NR-DC setup is triggered less

frequently.

With active downlink RLC buffer monitoring, signaling over the NG-C, Xn-C, and Uu

interfaces can be reduced. This is because for UEs with low traffic volume, NR-DC

setup is not triggered when downlink RLC buffer thresholds are configured with

values above the DRB traffic level.

At higher UE traffic, A4 measurement configuration is delayed for UEs with active

downlink RLC buffer monitoring indicating high buffer status.

UE battery consumption can be reduced by using downlink RLC buffer monitoring.

Operation

The following attributes can be used to configure the downlink RLC buffer

thresholds:

- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr

The following attributes are adapted to the UE Grouping Framework:

- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcEnabled
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMeasTime
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMeasRestartTime
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr
- NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr

The Buffer-based NR-DC Setup avoidance rate Performance Indicator can be used to

observe the percentage of potential NR-DC setups that are avoided because of not

meeting the buffer-based NR-DC setup criteria.

The following EBS counters associated with the NRCellCU MO are

used in the formula for the Buffer-based NR-DC Setup avoidance rate Performance

Indicator:

- pmEbsNrdcSetupMnBufMonConfig
- pmEbsNrdcSetupMnBufMonReport

The following PM counters related to throughput are increased in the Master Node and

decreased in the Secondary Node when downlink RLC buffer monitoring is active:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe

The following PM counters related to NR-DC setup are decreased when downlink RLC

buffer monitoring is active:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAtt
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSucc
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeSnAtt
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeSnSucc

The following PM counters related to NR-DC UE release are decreased when downlink RLC

buffer monitoring is active:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnNormal
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalMnInit
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalMnInitAct
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInit
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnAbnormalSnInitAct

The following counters related to the peak number of NR-DC UEs are decreased when

downlink RLC buffer monitoring is active:

- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnLevelMaxNrDc
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnLevelSumNrDc

The following PM events can be used to observe downlink RLC buffer monitoring:

- CuCpMnNrdcSetupBufMonConfig
- CuCpMnNrdcSetupBufMonReport

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement ensures higher data throughput for the UE on the Master Node

when the UE is not configured with NR-DC. This is achieved by adding the SCells for

the UE on the Master Node during the Secondary Node Release procedure.

Capacity and Performance

With increased use of carrier aggregation in use cases with configured NR-DC, the

Low-Band and Mid-Band downlink UE throughput might increase if Low-Band and Mid-Band

SCells are configured and used during the Secondary Node Release procedure.

The following EBS counters might change when SCells are added for the UE on the

Master Node during the Secondary Node Release procedure:

- pmEbsMacDrbThpDlMbbHighVolDistr
- pmEbsnMacDrbThpDlMbbHighVolDistr
- pmEbsMacDrbThpDlMbbLowVolDistr
- pmEbsnMacDrbThpDlMbbLowVolDistr

The EBS counters are associated with the NRCellDU MO. For

information on the EBS counters, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The following PM counters might change when SCells are added for the UE on the Master

Node during the Secondary Node Release procedure:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellExt

Operation

No impact.

NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## Appendix A.j: 23.Q2: Measurement Gap-Aware Secondary Node Scheduling for NR-DC

With the feature enhancement, the measurement gap configuration on the Master Node is

forwarded to the Secondary Node in NR-DC deployments.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

If the measurement gap configuration on the Master Node is forwarded to the Secondary

Node, the Secondary Node does not schedule the UE connected with NR-DC during the

measurement gap. This way, DTX can be avoided in the SCG.

During the Secondary Node Addition Procedure, the Master Node forwards the DRX

configuration,

which is used in the MCG, to the Secondary Node. Based on the

forwarded information, the Secondary Node aligns the DRX configuration of the SCG

with the DRX configuration of the MCG. This also applies when the Secondary Node

initiated Secondary Node Change procedure is performed.

The measurement gap information and the DRX configuration are sent from the Master

Node to the Secondary Node at the Secondary Node Addition and Secondary Node

initiated Secondary Node Change procedures.

If a measurement gap is configured or removed on the Master Node, the Master Node

initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure is used to forward measurement gap

information to the Secondary Node in the following cases:

- If a measurement gap is added, the measurement gap configuration is sent to the Secondary Node.
- If a measurement gap is removed, an instruction is sent to the Secondary Node to stop configuring measurement gaps.

The DRX configurations of the MCG and the SCG are only aligned at Secondary Node

Addition. If the DRX configuration changes during NR-DC operation, the DRX

configurations of the MCG and the SCG

might

not remain aligned. This can affect UE power consumption.

The measurement gap can change in the Master Node because of UE group changes that

are triggered by certain procedures. If this happens, the Secondary Node is not

informed about the updated measurement gap configuration. The following procedures

in NR-DC can cause changes in UE groups:

- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify
- PDU Session Resource Release

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- The Secondary Node does not schedule the UE that is connected with NR-DC during the measurement gap. This way, the DTX rate in the Secondary Node is expected to decrease. This might improve link adaptation and it also improves UE throughput in downlink and uplink.
- HARQ transmission failures are expected to decrease in the Secondary Node.
- Aligning the MCG DRX configuration with that of the SCG can reduce UE power consumption.
- Cell throughput might increase in the Secondary Node, as the Secondary Node can schedule more UEs during the measurement gap in addition to those that use the measurement gap.

Capacity and Performance

With the feature enhancement, the following performance impact can be expected:

- UE throughput is increased in downlink and uplink.
- UE power consumption might be reduced.
- Cell throughput might be increased in the Secondary Node.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the reduction in the DTX rate:

- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlDtxQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtxQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlDtx16Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtx16Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlDtx64Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtx64Qam

The following PM counters can be used to observe the improvement in cell

throughput:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl

The following PM counters can be used to monitor measurement gap handling in

NR-DC:

- NRCellDU.pmMeasGapDurationDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMeasGapUeMaxDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMeasGapUeMnMaxDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMeasGapUeSumDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMeasGapUeMnSumDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMeasGapUeSamp

The DuPerUeTrafficRep PM event with the

PER\_UE\_MAC\_MEAS\_GAP\_DRX\_INACT event parameter

can

be used to monitor the interval of the DRX inactivity timer

during a configured measurement gap.

Operation

No impact.

## Appendix A.l: 23.Q3: Dynamic QoS Modification in NR-DC

The feature enhancement allows the dynamic modification of the QoS properties of

already established QoS flows in Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions.

|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces the option to dynamically modify the 5QI and the

ARP parameters of the QoS profile of an already established QoS flow in a Secondary

Node terminated PDU session. The modification is initiated by the 5GC. The

modification is validated in the Master Node and the Secondary Node, and it is

signaled to the UE by the Master Node.

The dynamic modification of already established QoS properties provides increased

flexibility when changing the characteristics of the service.

Capacity and Performance

If the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure fails, the UE is

released. The UE release has the following results on performance:

- The UE throughput degrades until the Secondary Node Addition procedure is triggered for the UE.
- The number of attempted and successful NR-DC setup might increase. The PIs used for monitoring the Secondary Node Addition procedure as shown in Table 31 do not increase. Table 31 Performance Indicators for Monitoring Secondary Node Addition Performance Indicator Formula NR-DC Setup Success Rate Captured on Master gNodeB (expressed in percentage) 100 × NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSucc / NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAtt NR-DC Setup Success Rate Captured on Secondary gNodeB (expressed in percentage) 100 × NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeSnSucc / NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeSnAtt

The NRCellCU.pmPduSessionModifySucc counter increases because the

feature enhancement increases the number of successful PDU Session Modification

procedures.

Operation

Changing in the 5QI value can result in the change of the attributes defined in the

following 5QI tables:

- CUCP5qi
- CUUP5qi
- DU5qi

The following attributes are not allowed to be modified in an established QoS

flow:

- CUCP5qi.pdcpSnSize
- CUCP5qi.rlcMode
- DrbRlcUeCfg.rlcSNLength

If the 5QI or the ARP values are changed, the UE group that is assigned to the UE can

also change. This can affect the configuration of the UE group-adapted features.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the following messages on the Xn-C interface:

- The XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message on the Xn-C interface is updated with the PDU Session Resource Modification Info - SN terminated IE.
- The XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message on the Xn-C interface is updated with thePDU Session Resource Modification Response Info - SN terminated IE.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The 5GC must support the modification of QoS properties.

ENM version 23.3 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

## Appendix A.m: 23.Q4: Master Node-Based Mobility with Minimal SCG Interruption

The feature enhancement introduces support for Master Node-based mobility scenarios

with optimized PSCell handling for UEs configured with NR-DC.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables immediate NR-DC setup in the target PCell during

Master Node-based mobility using a selected PSCell. The selected PSCell can be the

serving PSCell that is kept, or a PSCell on the same frequency with better radio

link quality reported by the UE. With immediate Secondary Node Addition in the

target PCell, the following benefits apply:

- Interruption time for the UE configured with NR-DC is minimized for user plane transmissions in High-Band coverage.
- RRC signaling is reduced between the Master Node and the UE.

With the feature enhancement, user performance and data throughput in the SCG for the

UEs configured with NR-DC can be improved at Master Node-based handover.

Capacity and Performance

When Master Node-based handover is performed with the immediate Secondary Node

Addition procedure, the following impact can be observed:

- A slight decrease in capacity can be expected because of increased resource use in the Secondary Node during Master Node-based handover.
- A slight increase can be expected in control plane latency during the handover procedure because of the additional Secondary Node Addition procedure between the Master Node and the Secondary Node over the Xn-C interface.

Improved user experience is caused by the following factors:

- Improved performance and data throughput because of spending more time in High-Band frequencies during the following types of handovers: Inter-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover Inter-frequency intra-gNodeB handover Intra-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover Intra-frequency intra-gNodeB handover Intra-cell handover

The following PM counters increase because NR-DC-capable UEs spend more time in

High-Band frequencies:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl

RRC signaling is reduced, which can be observed through the

CuCpRrcReconfiguration PM event.

Operation

The value configured for the threshold member of the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate attribute is used

at the evaluation of the radio link quality of the PSCell candidate reported by the

UE at Master Node-based handover.

The following PM counters are introduced:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAttHoInterGnb
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSuccHoInterGnb
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSuccHoInterGnbPSCellKeep
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAttHoIntraGnb
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSuccHoIntraGnb
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSuccHoIntraGnbPSCellKeep
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAttHoIntraCell
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSuccHoIntraCell

The following Performance Indicators (PIs) are introduced:

| NR-DC NG based inter-gNB HO successful rate captured on master node   |    | The success rate of inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover with immediate                                 establishment of NR-DC in the target PCell, captured on the target                                 Master Node.   |

| NR-DC intra-gNB HO successful rate captured on master node            |    | The success rate of intra-gNodeB handover with immediate                                 establishment of NR-DC in the target PCell, captured on the Master                                 Node.                    |
|                                                                       |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| NR-DC intra-cell HO successful rate captured on master node           |    | The success rate of intra-cell handover with immediate establishment                                 of NR-DC in the target PCell, captured on the Master Node.                                                      |

The high values of these PIs indicate improved user experience for

NR-DC-capable UEs.

The CuCpProcMnNrdcSetup PM event is modified to reflect the

differentiation between the following handover types:

- Inter-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover
- Inter-frequency intra-gNodeB handover
- Intra-frequency intra-gNodeB handover
- Intra-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover
- Intra-cell handover

The PM event can also be used to monitor the immediate establishment of NR-DC

in the target PCell, and the success rate difference between whether the serving

PSCell is kept or changed during Master Node-based handover.

The CuCpProcSnNrdcSetup PM event is modified to reflect the

differentiation between the following procedures:

- Initial Secondary Node Addition
- Secondary Node initiated Secondary Node Change
- Inter-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover
- Inter-frequency intra-gNodeB handover
- Intra-frequency intra-gNodeB handover
- Intra-frequency inter-gNodeB, NG-based handover

The following PM counters are modified to enable the monitoring of the feature

performance during the inter- and intra-gNodeB, and intra-cell handover

procedures:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAtt
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnSucc
- EP\_XnU.pmPdcpPktFwdTransDlQos
- EP\_XnU.pmPdcpPktFwdTransDlDiscQos
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpPktFwdRecDlQos
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpPktFwdRecDlDiscQos

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the following interfaces:

- Uu A3 and A5 measurements are configured to additionally return the RRC MeasurementReport message containing the PCI of the best non-serving neighbor cell for each serving High-Band frequency. The RRC RRCReconfiguration message prepared by the target Master Node for Master Node-based mobility contains the SCG configuration.
- NG-C The RRC HandoverPreparationInformation message is updated with the measurement results on candidate PSCells from the UE.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, the measurement gap configuration on the target Master

Node is forwarded to the Secondary Node

during the Master Node

initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure after the following Master

Node-based handover procedures:

- Intra-gNodeB handover at Secondary Node Addition with immediate NR-DC setup
- Intra-cell handover at Secondary Node Addition with immediate NR-DC setup
- Inter-gNodeB handover at Secondary Node Addition with immediate NR-DC setup

During the Secondary Node Addition procedure with immediate NR-DC setup, the

DRX configuration of the target Master Node is also forwarded to the Secondary

Node.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- DTX rate in the Secondary Node is expected to decrease. This is because the Secondary Node does not schedule the NR-DC-connected UE during the measurement gap when the handover to a new PCell is completed.
- HARQ transmission failures are expected to decrease in the Secondary Node.
- UE power consumption might be reduced as a result of aligning the MCG DRX configuration with the SCG DRX configuration.
- Cell throughput can increase in the Secondary Node because the Secondary Node can schedule other UEs during the measurement gap in addition to those that already use the measurement gap.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement has the following impact on capacity and performance:

- UE throughput is increased in the downlink and in the uplink in the new PCell.
- UE power consumption might be reduced.
- Cell throughput might increase in the Secondary Node.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the reduction in the DTX rate:

- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlDtxQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtxQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlDtx16Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtx16Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlDtx64Qam
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlDtx64Qam

The following PM counters can be used to observe the improvement in cell

throughput:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl

The following PM counters can be used to monitor measurement gap handling in

NR-DC:

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Possibility to configure the preferred downlink cell group on 5QI and on QCI level, including the disabling of radio quality-triggered downlink cell group switching for Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.
- Possibility to tune the trade-off between rapid switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB and air interface resource consumption by configuring aperiodic CSI periodicity for Low-Band and Mid-Band PSCells, if there is no data transmission.

Capacity and Performance

Changing aperiodic CSI periodicity can affect the following processes:

- Switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB intensity between cell groups
- PDCCH and PUSCH load on SCG in EN-DC
- Traffic distribution between cell groups
- UE battery usage
- DRX sleep time on SCG in EN-DC

Configuring the preferred downlink cell group and the radio quality-triggered

switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated

split DRB affect the traffic distribution between cell groups.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

The measurement gap in the Master Node can change for the UEs configured with NR-DC

if the UE group changes because of any of the following procedures:

- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify
- PDU Session Resource Release

If the measurement gap configuration for the UEs changes, the Master Node transfers

the updated measurement gap configuration to the Secondary Node. This is done

through the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits after a UE group change:

- The Secondary Node does not schedule UEs connected with NR-DC during the measurement gap. As a result, the DTX rate in the Secondary Node is expected to decrease, which might improve link adaptation.
- HARQ transmission failures are expected to decrease in the Secondary Node.
- Cell throughput can increase in the Secondary Node, because the Secondary Node can schedule other UEs than those already using the measurement gap.
- UE throughput can increase, because the Secondary Node does not keep a measurement gap that is no longer needed.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement has the following impact on capacity and performance:

- UE throughput is increased in the downlink and in the uplink.
- Cell throughput might increase in the Secondary Node.
- Signaling on the RRC and Xn-C interfaces increases.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the performance of the feature with

NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## Appendix A.r: 24.Q3.0: Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release during UE Group Change in NR-DC

The feature enhancement allows the Master Node to reevaluate the conditions for NR-DC

when the UE group changes for a UE that is configured with NR-DC.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005              |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type            | NR                        |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

The UE group might change during the following procedures:

- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify
- PDU Session Resource Release

The UE group is reevaluated after these procedures. This feature enhancement allows

the Master Node to act based on a change in the NR-DC status of a UE detected by the

reevaluation. If NR-DC is no longer allowed, the Master Node initiates the Master

Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedure for the UE.

The feature has the following benefits when the UE Grouping Framework is used to

prevent NR-DC during a VoNR call:

- UE battery use might decrease.
- Secondary Node signaling during VoNR calls might be reduced because no Secondary Node management procedures are started.
- When the UE has more than four DRBs configured, the VoNR user plane interruptions caused by intra-cell handovers in the PCell triggered by NR-DC procedures can be reduced.

Capacity and Performance

A Secondary Node release for a UE because of a UE group change is observed on the

Secondary Node as a normal release. The number of normal Secondary Node releases

might increase, which can be observed through the following PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelRelocUeMnAtt
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelRelocUeMnSucc
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcRelUeSnNormal

Releasing the Secondary Node might cause a reduction in UE throughput. For UEs with

an ongoing high-throughput transmission, this might cause an increase in the length

of the Master Node queue. The increased length of the Master Node queue might

increase the number of packets discarded by the AQM.

The change in Master Node and Secondary Node throughput can be observed through the

following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The increase in the number of Secondary Node releases at UE group change might

increase signaling on the following interfaces:

- The Xn-C interface between the Master Node and the Secondary Node
- The Uu interface between the UE and the Master Node

After the Secondary Node is released, no Secondary Node-initiated signaling is used

on the Xn-C and the Uu interfaces.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

If the Secondary Node is released because of this feature enhancement, UEs might have

reduced power consumption.

NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## Appendix A.s: 24.Q4.0: Uplink Buffer-Based NR-DC Setup

Uplink buffer monitoring allows the triggering of NR-DC setup based on the traffic

level of the UE in the uplink buffer.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005              |

| Access Type            | NR                        |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                  |

Summary and Benefits

For UEs with short uplink data sessions, unnecessary NR-DC setups can be avoided by

using an uplink buffer threshold configuration specific to certain UE groups.

Configuring uplink buffer monitoring in the Master Node has the following

benefits:

- Control signaling might be reduced.
- UE battery life might be extended.

With the use of both downlink RLC buffer monitoring and uplink buffer monitoring, UE

throughput in uplink and Secondary Node resource use might be improved. UEs with low

data volume in downlink and high data volume in uplink benefit the most from this

feature enhancement. These UEs can be configured with NR-DC if the threshold in the

uplink buffer is exceeded.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement has the following impact on capacity and performance:

- The number of NR-DC setups might decrease for NR-DC-capable UEs.
- Traffic level might decrease in the SCG because NR-DC setup is triggered less frequently.
- Signaling over the NG-C, Xn-C, and Uu interfaces might decrease. Signaling over the NG-C, Xn-C, and Uu interfaces decreases, because NR-DC setup is not triggered for UEs with a low traffic volume in uplink when the uplink buffer threshold is configured with a value that exceeds the traffic level.
- During high UE traffic, A4 measurement configuration is delayed for UEs with active uplink buffer monitoring, which indicates high buffer status in uplink.
- UE battery consumption might be reduced.

This feature enhancement introduces the

pmEbsNrdcSetupMnBufMonReportUl EBS counter. This EBS

counter monitors the number of uplink buffer monitoring reports that are

received by the UE when the high buffer is not detected before NR-DC is

configured for the UE.

The pmEbsNrdcSetupMnBufMonConfig EBS counter is updated to

allow for the observability of uplink buffer monitoring.

For more information on EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The following PM events are updated to allow for the observability of uplink buffer

monitoring:

- CuCpMnNrdcSetupBufMonConfig
- CuCpMnNrdcSetupBufMonReport
- CuCpProcMnNrdcSetup

For more information on PM events associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The following PM counters are introduced to monitor the number of initial NR-DC setup

attempts that are initiated because of a downlink RLC or an uplink buffer monitoring

report:

- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAttInitBufDl
- NRCellCU.pmNrdcSetupUeMnAttInitBufUl

Table 33 shows the change in the values of

PM counters in the following cases:

- Uplink buffer monitoring is configured when downlink RLC buffer monitoring is already enabled.
- Uplink buffer monitoring is configured when downlink RLC buffer monitoring is not enabled.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows for an optimized performance

for configuring

uplink

cell group

switching

in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments. The following parameters can be configured

separately for EN-DC and NR-DC deployments:

- Uplink cell group switching status
- Low-quality threshold for the uplink radio quality SINR measurement
- Low-quality hysteresis for the uplink radio quality SINR measurement

Capacity and Performance

The throughput can be tuned in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments independently by adjusting

the low-quality threshold of uplink cell group switching. This can be beneficial

when the cell capacity difference between the EN-DC MCG and the NR-DC MCG is

large.

NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## Appendix A.x: 25.Q2.0: Enhanced PDU Session Setup and Release for NR-DC

The feature enhancement provides improved support for PDU session management

procedures for UEs configured with NR-DC.

| Feature Name           | NR-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5380              |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides support in the following cases:

- Setup of additional Secondary Node-terminated PDU sessions for a UE configured with NR-DC The feature enhancement is effective when additional services are requested to be set up. If the 5QI and the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) configuration allows Secondary Node termination for PDU sessions, the additional PDU sessions are set up with Secondary Node-terminated QoS flows in the Secondary Node. The used services can benefit from the increased throughput and UE performance the Secondary Node provides.
- Release of a subset of Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions for a UE configured with NR-DC With the feature enhancement, the UE configured with NR-DC remains connected when a subset of Secondary Node-terminated PDU sessions are released.

Capacity and Performance

With the additional Secondary Node-terminated PDU sessions that are set up according

to the 5QI and ARP configuration, the following impact can be expected for the UEs

configured with NR-DC:

- The data traffic volume is expected to decrease on the Master Node.
- The data traffic volume is expected to increase on the Secondary Node.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the changes in traffic volume in the

Master Node and the Secondary Node:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe

With the support of releasing a subset of Secondary Node-terminated PDU sessions, the

number of abnormal releases of UEs configured with NR-DC to idle mode can decrease.

This can be monitored by the DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per

mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only KPI that is expected to improve with the feature

enhancement.

Operation

The CuCpProcSnNrdcModification PM event is updated to monitor

the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure used to set up or

release Secondary Node-terminated PDU sessions in the Secondary Node.

Interfaces

The Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure is used to trigger

the setup or release of Secondary Node-terminated PDU sessions in the Secondary

Node. This can result in increased signaling over the Xn-C interface between the

Master Node and Secondary Node.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
