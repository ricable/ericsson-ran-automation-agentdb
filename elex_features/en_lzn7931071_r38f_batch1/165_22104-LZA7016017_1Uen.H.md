Summary and Benefits

The feature introduces support for the termination of the O-RAN A1 interface in the gNodeB,

and enables priority configuration of DRBs over the O-RAN A1 interface using A1

policies. The A1 interface is a multi-vendor interface defined in A1 specifications

by the O-RAN Alliance.

The feature supports a subset of the O-RAN A1 Policy Management Service to temporarily control

and optimize the scheduling of resources based on QoS priority level and QoS

relative priority for policy scope identifiers. A policy scope identifier consists

of a combination of a UE identifier, a QoS flow identifier, and optionally an

S-NSSAI.

The feature uses the A1AP protocol to apply A1 policies for the following QoS profile

modification purposes:

- Changing the configuration of the following scheduling priorities of the DRBs to be applied for the policy scope identifiers: The absolute priority scheduling of the DRBs. This is a function of the Priority-Controlled Scheduling feature. The relative priority scheduling of the DRBs. This is a function of the NR Relative Priority Scheduling feature. Multiple DRBs are supported for each policy scope identifier.
- Sending notifications in PM events when policies are applied.

The benefit of this feature is that the performance of UEs and DRBs can be optimized. Data

throughput can be increased based on UE-specific differentiation for different

services.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

QoS profile modification is not applied to the serving SCells and the target PCell at

handover. At outgoing handover, any QoS profile modification applied to the UE in

the source cell is not transferred to the target cell with the UE.

The following functions are not supported:

- The A1 policy update procedure
- The A1 policy status update
- The querying of policy types over the A1 interface

Maximum 100 A1 policies can be stored in the gNodeB.

Maximum 10 A1 transactions each second are allowed before overload protection is

applied.

Network Requirements

HTTPS with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 is needed for A1 communication with the gNodeB.

The following protocol versions are required over the A1 interface:

- O-RAN.WG2.A1AP-v03.02
- O-RAN.WG2.A1TD-v03.00
- O-RAN WG2.A1TP-v01.01

# 3 Feature Operation of NR QoS Profile Modification

The feature enables the termination of the O-RAN A1 interface in the gNodeB and supports

a subset of the A1 Policy Management Service.

The feature uses the A1AP protocol for QoS profile modification purposes. This makes it

possible to change the priority level of the DRBs on the policy scope identifiers, which

consist of the combination of UE trace IDs, 5QIs, and optionally S-NSSAI. Multiple DRBs

are supported for each policy scope identifier. These policy scope identifiers have the

following supported combinations:

- UE trace ID and 5QI
- UE trace ID, 5QI, and S-NSSAI

The LocalA1Endpoint MO class is introduced for handling A1 service IP

addresses, ports, certificates, and node credentials. The A1 interface uses HTTPS with

certificates for mutual authentication for security. For more information on certificate

and node credential configuration, see Manage Security.

Up to 10 A1 operations a second can be handled before overload protection is applied. The

overload protection is designed to only allow 10 A1 operations a second, and if more are

received, the overload protections ignores the rest. The higher the load, the more

requests are ignored. Ignored requests are indicated to the customer as an HTTP error

code.

The following A1 procedures are supported:

- Create policy
- Query policy
- Query all policy identifiers
- Query policy status
- Delete policy

A1 policies are stored in the gNodeB. Already stored policies are kept even when the web

server on the gNodeB is not running, or the feature is not activated. A1 policy

statements can contain QoS priority level and QoS relative priority level information,

and they are applied in the gNodeB.

Policy assignment sources are prioritized in the scheduler. The scheduler uses the

priority level and relative priority configuration from the highest priority assignment

source, if configured. It is possible to combine different levels of priority from

different priority assignment sources. For example, if relative priority is not used in

an A1 policy, but absolute priority is set and no other higher priority assignments are

set, relative priority is assigned according to MOM configuration and absolute priority

is applied according to the A1 policy. For the hierarchy of absolute and relative

priority configurations, see Table 2.

Depending on the configuration of absolute and relative priority, different behavior is

achieved. If some of the bearers are configured to have higher absolute priority than

the others, the higher priority bearers always access the available resources before

bearers with lower absolute priority. This might cause the starvation of other

connections. The NR QoS Profile Modification feature uses the function introduced in the

Priority-Controlled Scheduling feature.

For bearers with the same absolute priority, a bearer with higher relative priority is

granted access to available resources more frequently than bearers with lower relative

priority. The relative priority provides a more refined impact on low-priority users

with a lower risk of high priority users overtaking resources. The NR QoS Profile

Modification feature uses the function introduced in the NR Relative Priority Scheduling

feature.

When the gNodeB receives and stores a correctly formed policy, the status of the policy

is set to ENFORCED. Having the A1 policy status set to

ENFORCED in the gNodeB does not necessarily mean that the policy is

used.

# 4 Network Impact of NR QoS Profile Modification

The feature supports the O-RAN A1 interface and provides means to optimize UE and DRB

performance.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enables priority configuration for DRBs over the O-RAN A1 interface,

which can optimize performance. Depending on the configuration of absolute and

relative priority, different behavior is achieved.

If some of the DRBs are configured to have higher absolute priority than the others,

the higher priority DRBs always access the available resources before DRBs with

lower absolute priority. This might cause UEs that use the DRBs with lower absolute

priority to be denied necessary resources. To avoid this, it is possible to

configure a relative scheduling priority for different DRBs.

For DRBs with the same absolute priority, a DRB with higher relative priority is

granted access to available resources with higher probability than DRBs with lower

relative priority. The relative priority provides a more refined impact on

low-priority UEs with a lower risk of high priority UEs using up resources. It is

possible to adjust the scheduling weight of a DRB in a given slot.

Because of the priority handling in the NR QoS Profile Modification feature,

increased performance for a DRB might result in decreased performance for one or

more other DRBs.

When congestion occurs, a UE can be prioritized in the scheduler, which might result

in improved throughput or latency.

Interfaces

The feature introduces support for the termination of the O-RAN A1 interface using

the A1AP protocol in the gNodeB. A subset of the A1 Policy Management Service is

supported over the interface. The interface security uses HTTPS with certificates

for mutual authentication.

Overload protection in the gNodeB ignores a proportion of the requests over the

interface. The higher the load, the more requests are ignored. Ignored requests are

indicated as an HTTPS error code.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

procedures that apply A1 policies.

KPIs

The throughput and latency impact of this feature can be observed with the KPIs

related to the Priority-Controlled Scheduling and the NR Relative Priority Scheduling features.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

The following PM event is introduced for this feature:

- CuCpProcA1QosModification
- CuCpOranA1PolicyCreate
- CuCpOranA1PolicyQuery
- CuCpOranA1PolicyQueryAll
- CuCpOranA1PolicyStatusQuery

# 7 Activate NR QoS Profile Modification

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012622 MO instance. When the feature state changes from DEACTIVATED to ACTIVATED, A1 policies are applied only for new connections that match an A1 policy. Old connections are not affected.
2. Ensure that the LocalA1Endpoint MO is fully configured. This is necessary for the NR QoS Profile Modification feature to receive and store A1 policies.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR QoS Profile Modification

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

It is possible to perform only one of the deactivation steps for partial results.

However, full deactivation can only be achieved if both steps are performed.

Steps

1. Remove the LocalA1Endpoint MO or the value of any of its attributes. If the LocalA1Endpoint MO is removed, it is no longer possible to create, query, or delete A1 policies. However, policies that are already stored are still used.
2. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012622 MO instance. When the feature state changes from ACTIVATED to DEACTIVATED, it is still possible to create, query, or delete A1 policies, but new connections do not have any A1 policies applied. Old connections keep their A1 policies applied. If the feature is activated again, any stored, matching policy is applied to new connections.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR QoS Profile Modification

## 9.1 Install Certificates

Certificates must be installed in the CertM MO using Moshell. For

more information on the certificate installation process, see Manage Security.

Steps

1. Install a trusted certificate authority (CA) certificate. The root certificate, ca.pem, published by the trusted CA is needed.
2. Set the managedState attribute in the TrustedCertificate=1 MO instance to ENABLED.
3. Create the TrustCategory MO and add it in the TrustedCertificate MO instance.
4. Create the node credential. The node public key server-key.pem and the node certificate server-cert.pem, which are created using the same root certificate as in Step 1, are needed.
5. Create a NodeCredential MO.
6. Install the node credential created in Step 4.
