Summary

Common channel beamforming is used for cell shaping. Cell shaping

provides flexible cell coverage for different environments. Capacity and data rate

coverage are enhanced by beamforming.

In the downlink, Massive MIMO supports single-user MIMO with up to four

layers. Both horizontal and vertical beamforming are supported. Codebook-based

beamforming is implemented for better coverage and higher single user peak rate.

Downlink Single-User MIMO

Downlink single-user MIMO is implemented in NR as part of the Massive

MIMO feature. With downlink single-user MIMO, the antenna transmits more than one

beam to a UE at the same time.

In poor radio conditions, good coverage can be provided by using only

one beam. Downlink single-user MIMO provides higher peak rates for users with good

radio conditions.

The single-user peak rate increases proportionally with the number of layers. With

four layers, the peak rate reaches close to four times the peak rate with a single

layer.

The antenna array TX power is split between the beams. This means

that more beams equal less power for each beam.

The feature is supported on all Massive MIMO radio units supporting NR.

For the list of Massive MIMO radio units supporting NR, see the following

documentation:

- Supported Radio Capabilities
- Radio Node Configurations

Limitations

Digital tilt is configured only for macro coverage shape and flexible coverage shape.

In this way, predefined beamforming weight can be ensured.

The feature supports one SSB with one wide beam in the downlink.

TRS Resource Shifting is not supported in the following

configurations:

- 10 MHz
- 15 MHz
- 20 MHz together with downlink CRB blanking by the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Massive MIMO Mid-Band

The Massive MIMO Mid-Band feature uses beamforming. It increases network capacity,

coverage, and reduces interference.

Common Channel Beamforming Operation

Figure 1   Common Channel Beamforming with Configurable Coverage Shape

Downlink common channel beamforming weights are used to transmit the

following channels and signals:

- PSS
- SSS
- PBCH
- PDCCH
- The associated DMRSs

PDSCH is transmitted using downlink common channel beamforming weights when

no PMI is available. Otherwise, it is transmitted using single-user

MIMO.

Uplink common channel beamforming weights are used to receive the

following channels and signals:

- PRACH
- PUCCH
- PUSCH
- The associated DMRSs

Downlink Single-User MIMO Operation

With downlink single-user MIMO, the antenna can transmit more than one PDSCH layer to

a single UE. It allows the UE to reach higher peak rate in good radio

conditions.

Figure 2   Single-User MIMO

Single-user MIMO is supported up to four layers in cells of the following

bandwidths:

- 20 MHz
- 40 MHz
- 60 MHz
- 80 MHz
- 100 MHz

The single-user MIMO function is a closed loop scheme

based on single-panel codebook feedback. For this scheme, standardized codebooks for

precoding are defined for each allowed rank under each codebook configuration.

Different precoding weights in the codebooks direct power toward different relative

angles of departure in reference to the gNodeB antenna array boresight. The gNodeB

periodically provides the following resources to connected UEs:

- CSI-RS
- CSI-IM

The UEs send CSI feedback reports over the PUSCH aperiodically. These reports

sent by the UE consist of the following parameters:

- CQI, indicating the channel quality
- RI, indicating the preferred rank
- PMI, indicating the preferred precoding weight from the codebook associated with the preferred rank

Using the CSI feedback, the gNodeB formulates the

downlink signal including the precoding weight. A link adaptation algorithm chooses

the transmitted MCS level.

The following CSI-RS resources are available:

- 8-port CSI-RS
- 16-port CSI-RS
- 32-port CSI-RS

Up to two CSI-RS resources can be configured at a time, either 8 and 16 ports or 8

and 32 ports, set at the cell level. UEs are advised of the configured CSI-RS

resources, and which resource to use for CSI-measurements during RRC connection. If

the UE supports at least one of the CSI-RS port configurations available in the

cell, it is configured to use the highest number of ports by default. For example,

if 8 ports and 32 ports are configured in the cell and the UE supports up to 16

ports, the UE is configured with 8 ports. If the UE does not support any of the

configured CSI-RS, it rejects the RRC reconfiguration

message.

CSI-RS resources using 8, 16 or 32 ports can be enabled and associated with codebook

configurations using the following parameters:

- csiRsControl8Ports member of NRCellDU.csiRsConfig8P attribute
- csiRsControl16Ports member of NRCellDU.csiRsConfig16P attribute
- csiRsControl32Ports member of NRCellDU.csiRsConfig32P attribute

Codebook subset restrictions (as defined in NR standard 3GPP TS 38.214)

can be configured for the codebooks that have been identified for each enabled

CSI-RS resource. The codebook subset restrictions can be configured with the

i11Restriction and the i12Restriction

members in the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.csiRsConfig8P
- NRCellDU.csiRsConfig16P
- NRCellDU.csiRsConfig32P

The configuration is based on specifying the allowed values for certain PMI

components. With codebook subset restrictions, the gNodeB

can indicate to the UE (in UE RRC configuration) that certain precoding weights in

the codebooks-representing specific directions for use in downlink transmissions-are

forbidden for indication in UE CSI reporting.

The codebook configuration and the corresponding codebook subset restrictions must be

chosen to suit different deployment scenarios.

It is also possible to restrict the UE from sending certain

Rank Indicators. The Rank Indicator restriction can be set with the

NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction MO attribute. Depending on

the value of this attribute, the UEs in a Low-Band or Mid-Band cell can be restricted

from sending Rank Indicators for a specific rank or any arbitrary combination of

ranks.

Certain sites might benefit from a Rank Indicator restriction, for example where the High

Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled.

Observing Distribution of UE PMI Feedback

## 3.1 CSI-RS and TRS Resource Shifting

CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting can mitigate the negative effects

of CSI-RS and TRS interference.

Continuous CSI-RS and TRS broadcasts can affect the downlink performance

in adjacent cells in regions with significant inter-cell interference, for example cell

edges. If adjacent cells use the same CSI-RS and TRS resource allocations in such

regions, downlink performance can be degraded.

Depending on the UE implementation, CSI-RS and TRS interference can have

the following consequences:

- Decreased downlink throughput
- Decreased downlink decoding performance
- Incorrect CSI feedback
- Increased downlink BLER

The negative effects of CSI-RS and TRS interference can be mitigated by

enabling CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting. When applied to a network

with appropriate PCI planning, these functions allow different CSI-RS and TRS resource

allocations to be used in adjacent cells.

Both CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting rely on PCI planning, which

maximizes the reuse distance for all values of PCI modulo 6.

Using CSI-RS resource shifting and TRS resource shifting can have the

following trade-offs:

- Fewer resources can be available for PDSCH in TRS slots.
- The CSI-RS on PDSCH interference can degrade the PDSCH SINR, which can increase downlink BLER slightly.

In some UE chipsets, the CSI-RS interference mitigation function reduces inaccurate PMI

reporting that can happen in poor radio frequency conditions.

## 9.2 Observing Distribution of UE PMI Feedback

There are

rank-specific

PMI distributions for the codebooks associated with the Primary CSI-RS and Secondary

CSI-RS.

For the codebook associated with the Primary CSI-RS, the rank-specific PMI distributions

are the following:

- pmRadioUeRepPmiPrimaryCsiRsRank1Distr
- pmRadioUeRepPmiPrimaryCsiRsRank2Distr
- pmRadioUeRepPmiPrimaryCsiRsRank3Distr
- pmRadioUeRepPmiPrimaryCsiRsRank4Distr

For the codebook associated with the Secondary CSI-RS, the rank-specific PMI

distributions are the following:

- pmRadioUeRepPmiSecondaryCsiRsRank1Distr
- pmRadioUeRepPmiSecondaryCsiRsRank2Distr
- pmRadioUeRepPmiSecondaryCsiRsRank3Distr
- pmRadioUeRepPmiSecondaryCsiRsRank4Distr

Table 7   Cell Level PMI Distributions

|   N1 |   N2 |   PMI Distribution Size |
|------|------|-------------------------|
|    2 |    2 |                      64 |
|    4 |    1 |                      16 |
|    4 |    2 |                     128 |
|    8 |    1 |                      32 |
|    4 |    4 |                     256 |
|    8 |    2 |                     256 |

The distribution counters can be used to get an indication of the spatial distribution of

UEs in the cell. Each bin in the distribution counters indicates the number of

occurrences-observed from UE feedback samples taken each second-of a precoding weight

for the given layer defined for the

rank-specific

codebook.

Each precoding weight matrix includes one column for each transmitted layer. Each column

is defined based on the following:

- A directional weight component
- A polarization co-phasing term
- A cover code

The directional weight component (Vl,m) implements a systematic phase

shift

across the N1

×

N2 virtual antenna ports which make up the

virtual planar array.

The radiation pattern associated with each such weight has a narrow half power beam-width

in both azimuth and elevation. Also, the radiation patterns for different weights have

gain peaks directed towards different azimuth and elevation angles (different angles of

departure from the gNodeB array). These codebook weights, taken together, span the full

angular coverage of the cell.

For

the rank 1 codebooks, the directional weight component for a given PMI is evaluated

based on the substritutions l = i11 and

m = i12.

The codebooks for two or more layers include offset terms (determined based on the PMI

i13 component) which modify the weights applicable to different layers. All the layer

weights can be related to weights of the rank 1 codebooks. This property makes the

definition of the codebook subset restriction valid for all number of layers.

Similarly to the bit position in the codebook subset restriction bit string, the bin

indexes of the PMI distribution counters-communicated in RRC messages to the UE-are

related to PMI components i11 and i12 (of the rank 1 codebooks). This is done by the equation:

Bin = N2

×

O2

×

i11 + i12.

For AAS radios, the antenna pattern files provided for all rank 1 codebook weights for

the most popular macro shape codebooks. These pattern files can be used together with

the PMI distribution counters to compute a

time-averaged

estimate of the envelope of

UE-specific

PDSCH radiation.

for single or a very small number of UEs on an unloaded cluster.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement enables the following:

- The disabling of TRS and CSI-RS when no UE is connected to a cell
- The selective muting of the primary or secondary CSI-RS if no UE configured to measure them is connected to a cell.

Operation

The feature enhancement has an impact on the pmMacRBSymCsiRs

counter when CSI-RS muting takes place. When both CSI reference signals and TRS are

muted, there is a drop observed with this PM counter.
