# 1 PSCell Change to Higher Priority Overview

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature enables inter-frequency PSCell change to

frequencies with higher priority in good radio conditions in EN-DC deployments.

Summary

The feature provides a traffic steering mechanism to detect when the UE enters the coverage

area of a cell that is on a higher priority frequency than the current PSCell.

The feature configures the UE to periodically perform measurements on all configured frequency

relations with a priority higher than that of the current PSCell. If a higher

priority frequency is available, intra-gNodeB or inter-gNodeB PSCell change is

performed.

This feature is only active in good radio conditions as opposed to the NR Mobility feature

that handles the UE when in poor radio conditions. For more information, see NR Mobility.

The feature uses the A5 measurement as defined in 3GPP TS 38.331 NR; Radio

Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification.

PSCell Change to Higher Priority Based on Periodic Measurements

# 3 Feature Operation of PSCell Change to Higher Priority

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature performs inter-frequency PSCell change,

triggered based on periodic measurements, using the mobility procedures of the NR Mobility

feature.

## 3.1 Mobility Procedures for PSCell Change to Higher Priority

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature uses mobility procedures of the NR

Mobility feature.

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature uses

the following mobility procedures of the NR Mobility feature in EN-DC:

- Evaluation of PCI for PSCell Change
- Inter-frequency intra-gNodeB PSCell Change
- Inter-frequency inter-gNodeB PSCell Change

If the inter-frequency inter-gNodeB PSCell Change is rejected in the target gNodeB

because the UE capabilities do not support the target cell,  because of an eNodeB

configuration error, or because the target cell is blocked, the following operation is

observed:

- The Master Node sends the Cause information element with the cause value set to radioNetwork:no-radio-resources-available-in-target-cell, radioNetwork:target-not-allowed, or radioNetwork:cell-not-available respectively, to the source gNodeB in the X2AP SGNB CHANGE REFUSE message.
- The target PSCell is blocklisted in the source gNodeB for the UE. This prevents any subsequent PSCell Change attempts for the UE to the specific target PSCell while the UE context is kept in the source gNodeB.
- The UE is kept connected in EN-DC in the source PSCell regardless of the cause value in the X2AP SGNB CHANGE REFUSE message sent by the Master Node to the source gNodeB.

## 3.2 PSCell Change to Higher Priority Based on Periodic Measurements

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature performs inter-frequency PSCell change

to cells on higher priority frequencies based on periodic measurements.

The feature periodically measures frequencies to detect if any cells with higher priority

frequencies exist in the coverage area.

The following requirements must be fulfilled for a frequency to be part of the periodic

measurement:

- The frequency must be in the set of frequencies defined by the NRFreqRelation MO instances of the NRCellCU MO class related to the current PSCell.
- The priority of the frequency must be higher than the priority of the frequency of the current PSCell. Frequency priority is defined by the UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModePrioPSCell attribute.
- Placing the PSCell on the frequency must be allowed. See the UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPSCell attribute.
- The UE must be able to handle the band of the frequency.
- At least one of the PLMNs allowed for the UE must match one of the PLMNs allowed to use the frequency. PLMNs that are allowed to use a frequency are defined by the NRFreqRelation.plmnIdList and the NRFreqRelation.plmnRestriction attributes.

If the requirements are not fulfilled, the frequency will not be part of the periodic

measurements.

The feature operation starts with an initial wait time period, followed by a periodic

search sequence consisting of an active period of

A5

measurements and an inactive period without

A5

measurements. The length of the periods is defined by the following attributes:

- Initial wait time period: TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.hiPrioDetStartTime
- Active period: TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.hiPrioDetMeasurementTime
- Inactive period: TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.hiPrioDetInactiveTime

The sequence of active and inactive periods is repeated until either of the following

happens:

- The UE measures and reports a PSCell candidate through an A5 measurement report. The change to the PSCell candidate is triggered. Note: The UE can measure and report more PSCell candidates in the A5 measurement report through configuring the TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.maxReportCells attribute, however, the Secondary Node only checks the first reported cell.
- The Secondary Node (SN) is released.
- The UE enters a search zone used by the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage (MCPC) function of the NR Mobility feature for EN-DC.

The A5

measurement report is triggered by the UE when the A5

measurement

trigger conditions have been fulfilled for a time-to-trigger period.

Figure 1 shows the periodic A5 measurement

process.

Figure 1   Periodic Measurements

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature interacts with the Mobility Control at Poor

Coverage for EN-DC function of the NR Mobility feature. The interaction is the same

regardless of the measurement trigger quantity used for the Mobility Control at Poor

Coverage for EN-DC function.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the

possible

interactions.

Figure 2   Interaction with MCPC for EN-DC Function When UE Enters a Search Zone

Figure 3   Interaction with MCPC for EN-DC Function When Initial Wait Time Period or

Inactive Period Ends

- When the UE enters a search zone while the PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature has ongoing A5 measurements, these A5 measurements are removed, and the initial wait time period is started.
- When the UE enters a search zone while the PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature has ongoing A5 measurements and a PSCell candidate has been reported and stored during the ongoing Priority period, a PSCell change to the stored PSCell candidate is initiated. Note: At the beginning of the active period, a priority period is started if there are multiple frequency relations that have a higher priority than the PCell frequency relation. During this priority period, the feature only triggers a PSCell Change if the reported cell belongs to the frequency relation with the highest priority. If the reported cell is not related to the frequency with the highest priority, the cell is stored, and is used to trigger a PSCell Change when the priority period ends.
- When the initial wait time period ends, A5 measurements are only started if the UE is not in any search zone. Otherwise, the initial wait time period is restarted.
- When the inactive period ends, A5 measurements are only started if the UE is not in any search zone. Otherwise, the initial wait time period is started.

## 3.3 PSCell Change to Higher Priority Triggered by NR Cell Reprioritization in EN-DC Distribution Model

This feature has the configuration option to allow the PSCell Change to Higher

Priority feature on UE group level when a candidate NR cell is reprioritized by the EN-DC

distribution model.

The PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature can be allowed with the

TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.hiPrioAllowedForDistUeEnabled attribute

even if the candidate NR cell is reprioritized by the EN-DC distribution model on the

Master Node.

## 3.4 Supported Trigger Quantities for PSCell Change to Higher Priority

RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR can be configured as the trigger quantity for the measurements

used by this feature.

The A5 measurements triggered by the PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature can use one

of the following trigger quantities:

- RSRP
- RSRQ
- SINR

The TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.candidateA5TriggerQuantity attribute is

used to define the trigger quantity used for measurements.

The gNodeB can be configured to evaluate reported quantities other than the trigger

quantity that are included in the measurement report.

The gNodeB can be configured to evaluate an additional reported quantity included in the

A5 measurement report

apart

from the trigger quantity configured for that measurement. The additional evaluation

ensures that the

reported quantities are not

poor in the target cell. The following attributes can be used to

determine the additional reported quantity to be evaluated:

- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCandidateA5AddTargEval
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCandidateA5AddTargEval
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCandidateA5AddTargEval

The attribute used to define the additional reported quantity to be evaluated depends on

the trigger quantity defined for the

feature.

Table 3   Possible Additional Reported Quantities Based on Trigger Quantity

| Trigger Quantity   | Attribute                                         | Possible Additional Reported Quantities to Evaluate   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| RSRP               | TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCandidateA5AddTargEval | None     RSRQ     SINR                                |
| RSRQ               | TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCandidateA5AddTargEval | None     RSRP                                         |
| SINR               | TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCandidateA5AddTargEval | None     RSRP     RSRQ     RSRP and RSRQ              |

The reported value of the defined additional quantity included in the measurement report

is evaluated against a threshold. The threshold corresponds to the threshold value used

by the UE if the reported quantity is used as the trigger quantity for A5 measurements.

If the value of the reported quantity is higher than the threshold value, the gNodeB

evaluates the priority of the reported cell before either storing the measurement

report, or triggering a mobility action. If the value of the reported quantity is lower

than or equal to the threshold value, the measurement report is discarded by the gNodeB,

and no mobility action is triggered for the UE.

## 3.6 UE Group Support for Inter-Frequency PSCell Change to Higher Priority

This feature is UE group-adapted.

Differentiated configuration of the A5 measurement is supported for UE groups.

Reconfiguration of the A5 measurement is supported, if the configuration of the A5

measurement changes after the UE is moved to another UE group during an active

connection.

The UE group differentiated configuration of the Inter-Frequency PSCell Change to Higher

Priority function is license controlled through the User- and Service-Specific Mobility

feature.

# 4 Network Impact of PSCell Change to Higher Priority

The feature improves network utilization and total throughput. The feature can have a

negative impact on UE throughput and energy consumption.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves network utilization and total throughput.

The feature can have a negative impact on UE throughput and energy consumption. The

following impact is possible if this feature is used together with the Optimized UE

Distribution for EN-DC feature:

- The number of A5 measurements can decrease. As a result, the number of PSCell Change procedures can also decrease, retaining the achieved user distribution as much as possible.
- End user throughput can decrease, because high-capacity cell utilization is prevented.

To mitigate these negative impacts when the feature is used with the Optimized

UE Distribution for EN-DC feature, set the value of the

TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.hiPrioAllowedForDistUeEnabled

attribute to true.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for PSCell Change to Higher Priority

It is possible to configure the threshold2 values of the possible

trigger quantities to improve performance.

For optimal performance, the default value of the threshold2 struct

member must be configured manually for one of

the

following attributes that corresponds to the trigger quantity

configured with the TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.candidateA5TriggerQuantity

attribute:

- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCandidateA5
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCandidateA5
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCandidateA5

For optimal performance, the threshold2 value sent to the UE can be

further adjusted for each frequency relation with the following attributes:

- TrStPSCellNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpCandidateA5Thr2Offset
- TrStPSCellNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqCandidateA5Thr2Offset
- TrStPSCellNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrCandidateA5Thr2Offset

If the additional target evaluation of an additional reported quantity is enabled, the

threshold2 struct member of one of

the

following attributes corresponding to that reported quantity must be

manually configured for optimal performance:

- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCandidateA5
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCandidateA5
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCandidateA5

The NRCellCU.trStPSCellProfileRef attribute must be set to reference a

valid TrStPSCellProfile MO instance.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q4: UE Group Adaptation for Inter-Frequency PSCell Change to Higher Priority

This feature enhancement introduces support for UE group differentiated configuration

of the Inter-Frequency PSCell Change to Higher Priority function in the NR Mobility

feature.

| Feature Name           | PSCell Change to Higher Priority   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5334                       |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                    |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                          |

Summary and Benefits

The

UE group adaptation is introduced through the new

TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg MO class. The legacy attributes in the

existing MO class are deprecated and replaced by the corresponding attributes in the

new MO class.

This feature enhancement allows the differentiated configuration of the A5

measurement for UE groups.

If

the configuration of the A5 measurement changes after the UE is moved to another UE

group during an active connection, the reconfiguration of the A5 measurement is

supported .

The UE group differentiated configuration of the Inter-Frequency PSCell Change to

Higher Priority function

is

license-controlled through the

User- and Service-Specific Mobility

feature.

Capacity and Performance

By using the flexible counter framework for EBS counters, operators can define

differentiated counters for different UE groups. Events can be

defined

by using UE group identifiers as separate flexible counter filtering attributes. For

more information, see UE Grouping Framework.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList
- TrStPSCellProfileUeCfg.ueConfGroupList
- TrStPSCellProfile.ueConfGroupType

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.

The feature enhancement improves performance by blocklisting rejected target cells

and preventing further PSCell change attempts to the blocklisted cells.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                                   |

Summary and Benefits

If an

inter-gNodeB

PSCell change triggered by

PSCell

Change to Higher Priority is rejected by the target

gNodeB

because of insufficient UE capabilities, the NR connection is maintained by the

source

gNodeB.

The enhancement ensures that the target cell is blocklisted for the UE and prevents

further PSCell change attempts to the target cell. As a result, the KPIs are

improved.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved EN-DC retainability
- Improved inter-gNodeB PSCell change success rate

Capacity and Performance

As the source

gNodeB

connection is maintained even if the PSCell change is rejected, the EN-DC

retainability KPI, SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability Captured in gNodeB is

improved.

As no more PSCell change attempts are triggered to blocklisted cells, the EN-DC

mobility KPI, EN-DC

inter-gNodeB

PSCell Change Success Rate Captured in gNodeB is improved.

The enhancement also has an impact on the operation of the EN-DC Mobility Control in

Poor Coverage function of the NR Mobility feature. The blocklist is read by the

function to decide whether a cell is a valid target. In case the cell is

blocklisted, no PSCell change is triggered and the EN-DC Mobility Control in Poor

Coverage searches for other target cells.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

This is a correction for the NR Mobility enhancement Blocklisting of PSCell Change

Target Cells in EN-DC, which has resulted in lower PSCell change success rate

KPI.

| Feature Name           | NR Mobility         |

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5041        |

| Access Type            | NR                  |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

The NR mobility improvement in 23.Q2 improves the failure handling for inter-gNodeB

PSCell change in EN-DC. If the PSCell change is rejected, the source gNodeB

connection is maintained instead of released which allows the UE to continue to

receive data using SCG radio resources.

If the reject cause is

no-radio-resources-available-in-target-cell (used

when the PSCell change is rejected because of insufficient UE capabilities) the

target cell is blocklisted to prevent further PSCell change attempts to the same

target cell. For other cause values, no blocklisting is performed but NR connection

is still maintained and therefore there can be additional PSCell change attempts

triggered to the same target cell for this NR connection in 23.Q2 software. This

could cause a decrease in the PSCell change KPI, if those additional PSCell change

attempts are also rejected.

Capacity and Performance

The improvement made in 23.Q2 can lead to the exposure of configuration issues,

resulting in repeated rejection of PSCell change attempts.

If the configuration fault exists, PSCell change KPI can degrade, since NR connection

is maintained and repeated attempts are made to the same target gNodeB, which are

then repeatedly rejected because of some underlying configuration issue. The

following are examples of configuration faults:

- Either GUtranSyncSignalFrequency, ExternalGNodeBFunction or ExternalGUtranCell is missing on the eNodeB for the target gNodeB, causing all the PSCell changes towards the target gNodeB to be rejected by MeNB with the cause code target-not-allowed.
- TermpointToGNB is missing or disabled for the target PSCell change request towards the target gNodeB to be rejected by MeNB with cause code target-not-allowed.

The operator must investigate the underlying configuration issue to improve the KPI,

as there could be additional configuration issues that could cause the eNodeB to

reject the PSCell Change Request with the cause code

target-not-allowed.

If the PSCell Change is rejected with the cause code

target-not-allowed, the target cell is blocklisted

as well.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            | Optional                                    |

Summary and Benefits

Both the NR Mobility feature and the PSCell Change to Higher Priority feature can

trigger an inter-gNodeB PSCell change for EN-DC-connected UEs. The inter-gNodeB

PSCell change is triggered by the source gNodeB, and performed through the

eNodeB.

If the PSCell change fails, the eNodeB rejects the PSCell change over the X2

interface with an appropriate cause value. If the PSCell change is rejected because

of a permanent error, such as insufficient UE capabilities or eNodeB

misconfiguration, the gNodeB does not perform any further PSCell change

attempts.

To prevent the degradation of mobility KPIs, the source gNodeB blocklists the target

cell at a failed PSCell

change

if the cause value is one of the following values:

- no-radio-resources-available-in-target-cell
- target-not-allowed

The blocklist is UE-specific and is stored as long as the UE is connected to the

source gNodeB.

If the PSCell change fails because of eNodeB misconfiguration, blocklisting the

target cell increases the difficulty of detecting and addressing the configuration

errors. To prevent blocklisting in this case, this feature enhancement allows for

disabling the blocklisting of target cells at eNodeB misconfiguration. This is

performed through returning the cause value

no-radio-resources-available instead of

target-not-allowed. The

no-radio-resources-available cause value does not result in the

target cell being blocklisted, which allows triggering additional PSCell change

attempts to the same target cell.

The following cases are examples of configuration faults:

- Any of the following MO classes are missing on the eNodeB, which results in all PSCell changes towards the target gNodeB to be rejected by the eNodeB with the cause value target-not-allowed: ExternalGNodeBFunction ExternalGUtranCell GUtranFreqRelation GUtranSyncSignalFrequency
- The TermpointToGNB MO class is missing or disabled for the target PSCell. This results in the change request towards the target gNodeB to be rejected by the eNodeB with the cause value target-not-allowed.

Capacity and Performance

Disabling the blocklisting of target cells at eNodeB misconfiguration can result in

the degradation of the EN-DC inter-gNodeB PSCell Change Success Rate Captured in

gNodeB KPI. The degradation of the KPI is used to identify and correct the

configuration error.

Operation

The X2AP cause value for eNodeB misconfiguration can be differentiated with

no-radio-resources-available by setting the value of the

ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary84 attribute to

1. The default value of this attribute is OFF.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the X2AP SGNB CHANGE REFUSE message

on the X2-C interface, which is used during PSCell change.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Description of Correction

This feature enhancement deprecates the

ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary84 attribute. The

ENodeBFunction.diffX2CauseMisconfig attribute is introduced

to replace the deprecated attribute. The

ENodeBFunction.diffX2CauseMisconfig attribute is used to

enable the differentiation of the X2AP cause values in the X2AP SGNB CHANGE

REFUSE message for eNodeB misconfiguration.

If the attribute is set to 0, the target-not-allowed

X2AP cause value is used to refuse the inter-gNodeB PSCell change

to

the target PSCell. In this case, the target PSCell is blocklisted by the source

gNodeB to prevent further inter-gNodeB PSCell change attempts

to

the same PSCell.

If the attribute is set to 1, the

no-radio-resources-available X2AP cause value is used instead,

and the target PSCell is not blocklisted by the source gNodeB.
