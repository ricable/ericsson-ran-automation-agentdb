Summary

The feature enables downlink carrier aggregation with TDD-FDD duplex mode carriers between up

to two Advanced RAN Coordination partners. A TDD cell serves as SpCell, and an FDD

cell serves as SCell. The Advanced RAN Coordination partners (gNodeB-DUs or capacity

modules) are connected by an E5 link through the Advanced RAN Coordination

feature.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- More efficient use of the scattered spectrum is achieved by carrier aggregation.
- Faster access is available to a wide bandwidth TDD cell at connection setup.
- UEs can be steered from low-band FDD carriers to mid-band TDD carriers.
- The system performance and the end-user experience are improved.
- The load can be quickly divided between the TDD and FDD frequencies.
- The SCell selection is improved.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- Maximum two component carriers can be aggregated.
- Maximum six partner gNodeBs are supported over the Advanced RAN Coordination feature for carrier aggregation, with up to 72 external SCells in total.
- 5QI cannot be transferred from the SpCell to the ESCell in case of inter-Baseband NR carrier aggregation in the downlink.
- The feature is not supported where the SpCell has 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured and the SCells have more than 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured.
- In external SCells, the UE throughput might decrease in sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use the component carriers because of reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

## 2.1 Downlink Carrier Aggregation Features in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The NR downlink carrier aggregation features in Low-Band and Mid-Band use the same

SCell selection algorithm.

If a carrier aggregation feature with a higher number of component carriers is enabled,

the carrier aggregation features with a lower number of component carriers are also

enabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of TDD PCell Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Low/Mid-Band

The feature improves system performance and enables more flexible carrier aggregation by

allowing inter-baseband downlink carrier aggregation with a TDD cell as SpCell and an FDD

cell as SCell.

In the gNodeB SCell selection algorithm, the secondary cells of UEs that can use carrier

aggregation can be expanded across two gNodeBs.

The UE connects to the SpCell, then the gNodeB runs the SCell selection algorithm and

checks the following information:

- The carrier aggregation neighbor cell configuration, that is, the SCell candidate and carrier aggregation status for the inter-gNodeB ESCell
- The UE capability
- The lists of allowed band combinations

If all conditions are met, the carrier aggregation-capable UE is configured with

one downlink SCell.

Figure 1   Inter-Baseband Carrier Aggregation with Advanced RAN Coordination

The following processes are shown in Figure 1:

1. The gNodeB Xn network is set up according to legacy. Advanced RAN Coordination-specific communication is set up between gNodeBs that host SpCell-ESCell relations using the Xn network.
2. The gNodeBs connect through IDLe or TN ports. E5 links are set up on the IDLe or TN ports between gNodeBs. Inter-gNodeB communication tunnels are set up between gNodeBs that host SpCell-ESCell relations.
3. The UE connects to the SpCell. The ESCell is configured and activated according to the same criteria as an internal SCell. Data is sent to the ESCell through IDLe or TN ports, and high-bandwidth information flows between gNodeBs as required.

## 3.1 Advanced RAN Coordination Partner gNodeB-DUs Modeling for Carrier Aggregation

The SpCell and SCell are hosted on different gNodeB-DUs in different

gNodeBs.

This inter-gNodeB operation uses Advanced RAN Coordination between the gNodeB-DUs

connecting with IDLe or TN ports. This communication link is automatically set up

between Baseband units and is defined as the E5 interface.

This feature uses the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO class to represent

the external gNodeB-DU. This MO class provides attributes for partner gNodeB

identification and for VLAN port reference to be used in carrier aggregation.

## 3.2 SCell Configuration and Deconfiguration

The feature modifies the SCell selection algorithm of the NR DL Carrier Aggregation

feature.

SCells are configured with blind selection at initial selection. For a carrier

aggregation-capable UE, all configured cells in the gNodeB that are not SpCells can be

SCell candidates. For more information about SCell configuration and deconfiguration,

see NR DL Carrier Aggregation.

The TDD PCell Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Low/Mid-Band feature modifies the SCell

selection algorithm of the NR DL Carrier Aggregation feature to consider

PRB blanking as an extra factor for the candidate serving cells.

## 3.3 SCell Activation and Deactivation

The feature introduces a new MO class to the activation and deactivation algorithm to

control RSRP and RSRQ levels.

Downlink transmissions on an SCell are only possible if the SCell is activated. If an

SCell is deactivated but still configured, transmission is not possible on that carrier.

For more information about SCell activation and deactivation, see NR DL Carrier Aggregation.

The feature introduces the new CaFreqRelMeasProfile MO class, so that

the frequency offset values can be added to the A1 and A2 measurement thresholds. This

way, the RSRP and RSRQ levels can be controlled for SCell activation and deactivation.

The UAI overheating mitigation is prioritized over buffer-based and

measurement-based activation and deactivation. If the UAI overheating is mitigated,

in-coverage SCells can be reactivated.

## 3.4 Link Scheduling

The downlink data buffer split algorithm is the same as for the internal cells in the NR

DL Carrier Aggregation feature. Downlink data transmission to a UE on ESCell has the

same data volume and channel quality requirements as an internal SCell.

The new data allocation towards ESCell is based on the following information:

- The downlink data buffer status of the UE
- The estimated ESCell channel conditions
- The ESCell congestion status reported by ESCell

The ESCell receives data over the E5 link and schedules the data. The ESCell allocates

data packets according to the order determined by the SpCell. During

transmission, the ESCell does not split the data packets received from the

SpCell.

The ESCell scheduler discards those downlink data packets that are expired but not

successfully transmitted. The SpCell handles the RLC retransmission for the

discarded packets.

When the SpCell receives the HARQ feedback and the CSI report of the UE in

uplink, the SpCell informs the ESCell.

### 3.4.1 Connected Mode DRX Control

The SpCell and the external SCell for a UE are configured with the same DRX

group. The SpCell and the ESCell control DRX status separately and update

their inactivity timer locally.

When the downlink data transmission is continuous, the UE remains awake and provides

up-to-date downlink channel quality measurements. When there is no ongoing downlink data

transmission to the UE, the UE goes into DRX operation so it does not remain awake.

Under DRX operation, the UE can perform CSI-RS measurements while the

DrxProfileUeCfg.drxOnDurationTimer or the

DrxProfileUeCfg.drxInactivityTimer timer is running. When the UE awakes,

the latest CSI-RS report might not be up-to-date, depending on the sleep time.

# 4 Network Impact of TDD PCell Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Low/Mid-Band

The feature increases cell capacity and downlink throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cell capacity is expected to increase because downlink data transmission is more

efficient. Downlink throughput is increased by aggregating two carriers.

If corresponding configured timings (K1) are missing, not all downlink slots can be

used for data transmission. Because of this, the highest single UE peak throughput

cannot be achieved.

Some TDD patterns encounter HARQ-process exhaustion, which affects peak

throughput.

For more information, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR

RAN.

# 7 Activate TDD PCell Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Low/Mid-Band

To use the feature, it must be activated in the appropriate MO instance. Additional

PUCCH resource must be allocated in the cell for carrier aggregation to avoid downlink

throughput degradation.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012570 MO instance.
2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to true.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate TDD PCell Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Low/Mid-Band

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. It must be deactivated before the activation of any conflicting

feature. If the cell is not intended to be used as SpCell for carrier aggregation, the

additional PUCCH allocation must be stopped to avoid PUCCH overhead.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012570 MO instance.

If the cell is not intended to be used as SpCell for carrier aggregation, do the

following:

2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to false.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for TDD PCell Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Low/Mid-Band

## 9.1 VLAN ID for Carrier Aggregation

A default VLAN ID for carrier aggregation in inter-Baseband configurations can be

configured with the GNBDUFunction MO class, which sets the pattern for

separation on feature level.The content of this chapter is applicable only to Inter-Baseband

Configurations.

To support the separation for each E5 link connection, a separate VLAN ID must be

configured for each E5 connection toward different partner gNodeB-DUs. The

ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO has VLAN ID configuration options for

this.

When VLAN ID configuration is defined on both gNodeB-DU level and external gNodeB-DU

partner level, external gNodeB-DU partner level configuration has priority.

VLAN IDs 1, 10, and 770 must not be used as VLAN IDs for NR carrier aggregation traffic

and backhaul traffic because these IDs have specific internal use in the following

units:

- Baseband 6648
- Baseband 6641
- RAN Processor 6651
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347

For more information about VLAN ID configuration for carrier aggregation, see Advanced RAN Coordination.

## 9.2 Carrier Aggregation Partner Relation Status Reporting

The primary gNodeB sets up an E5 tunnel towards a neighbor gNodeB-DU when the following

conditions apply:

- The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL.
- The ExternalNRCellCU.serviceState attribute on the carrier aggregation candidate is set to IN\_SERVICE.

For each carrier aggregation candidate relation that is related to an E5 tunnel, the

NRCellRelation.caStatusActive attribute indicates if this ESCell

can be used for carrier aggregation. This information is used by the SCell selection

algorithm in gNodeB.

The NRCellRelation.caStatusInfo attribute provides additional status

information on the status of carrier aggregation supplementing the

NRCellRelation.caStatusActive attribute.
