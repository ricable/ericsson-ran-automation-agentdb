The NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature supports wider carrier                                 bandwidths in Low-Band PCell and Low-Band SCell. |

Hardware

The feature supports Radio Gateway and the RAN Compute units on the following carrier

bandwidths:

- 25MHz
- 30MHz
- 35MHz
- 40MHz
- 50MHz

The feature is not supported on Massive MIMO FDD radio units, except for AIR 3283 B25

B66 in configurations with up to 35MHz bandwidth and for AIR 3284 unit in

configurations with up to 50 MHz.

For more information on supported radio units, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

For more information on Radio Gateway, see Fronthaul.

Limitations

Asymmetric bandwidth and asymmetric ESS configurations are not supported.

For more information about RAN Compute units, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Large Bandwidth Support Low-Band

The feature can be configured through attributes.

The following carrier bandwidths can be configured through the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL and the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL attributes:

- 25 MHz
- 30 MHz
- 35 MHz
- 40 MHz
- 50 MHz

## 3.1 Bandwidth Parts

The feature supports two BWPs in each cell. One of the supported BWPs is a 20 MHz BWP

that can be placed in a bottom position or in a top position on the cell bandwidth. The

other supported BWP is equal to the cell bandwidth. For more information, see NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Large Bandwidth Support Low-Band

The feature affects the supported number of sector carriers and increases the cell

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases cell throughput. It also changes the sector carrier capacity

handling. If all sector carriers are configured to have the same carrier bandwidth

that is wider than 20 MHz, the number of supported sector carriers might decrease.

For more information, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity and Fronthaul.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Large Bandwidth Support Low-Band

The feature can be configured by setting the carrier bandwidth both in downlink and

uplink.
