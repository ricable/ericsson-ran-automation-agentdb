# 1 NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support Overview

The feature enables UEs with reduced bandwidth capabilities to use cells with wider

bandwidth.

Summary

In some deployments, the cell bandwidth might be restricted because of the different bandwidth

capabilities supported by the UEs that occur in the cell. For example, some UE

models do not support 70-MHz cell bandwidth in TDD cells.

This feature makes it possible to configure the cell with a full bandwidth part, and at the

same time configure one partial bandwidth part for the same cell. This makes it

possible for UEs with reduced bandwidth capability to attach to the cell.

Partial bandwidth parts can also be configured on SCells.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Cell and UE throughput are increased by allowing cells to be configured with wider bandwidth.
- Flexibility is increased by solving the mismatch between the network bandwidth and the reduced bandwidth capabilities of certain UE types.

Additional Information

For more information about BWP configuration, see 3GPP TS 38.331.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The feature has certain limitations regarding BWP configurations in FDD and TDD

cells.

Hardware

The feature is not supported on AIR 3284.

For more information on Baseband configurations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity in the Radio

Node Configurations library.

Limitations

Only cells configured with NR standalone and NR standalone + EN-DC deployments are

supported. The feature is not supported in cells configured as EN-DC only.

P-BWP UEs with P-BWP=80 MHz and F-BWP=90 MHz TDD

configurations cannot be used together with PRB blanking at the bottom of the

bandwidth for the following radios:

- AIR3239
- AIR6454
- AIR6488

Reciprocity-based multi-user MIMO and single-user MIMO are not supported if the

following options are all applicable:

- The UE is capable of 1T4R only.
- The TDD cycle is 10 slots.
- SRS periodicity of 40 slots is used.

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature is not supported on band N79 in TDD when

all of the following conditions are met:

- The F-BWP is equal to or larger than 40 MHz.
- The P-BWP is 20 MHz.
- The frequency position for the SSB is not placed in CRB positions 10-12 relative to the starting point of CRB 0 of the P-BWP.
- The frequency position for the SSB is not placed in CRB positions 38-40 relative to the starting point of CRB 0 of the P-BWP.

For a cell bandwidth of 40 MHz or larger, the step size for the SSB raster for band

N79 is 16. A raster step size of 16 means that the available number of SSB frequency

positions specified by the synchronization signal reference frequency decreases

because the distance between the SSB frequency positions increases. To fit CORESET#0

and SSB in the P-BWP, the frequency position for the SSB must be placed in one of

the following CRB positions:

- 10-12 relative to the starting point of CRB 0 of the P-BWP
- 38-40 relative to the starting point of CRB 0 of the P-BWP

For more information, see Synchronization Signal Block Configuration Parameters in

Manage Radio Network.

NR Dynamic Power Optimizer and NR Reduced Bandwidth Support Feature Coexistence

CRB Blanking in Cells with NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The feature configures a BWP to the UE based on UE bandwidth capabilities.

BWP Concept

A BWP is a part of the carrier bandwidth defined by a set of PRBs. If a UE connects

to the gNodeB, the gNodeB configures a BWP to the UE based on the bandwidth

capabilities of the UE.

The cell can be configured with the following BWPs:

- A full BWP (F-BWP) that uses the entire cell bandwidth.
- A partial BWP (P-BWP) for UEs not supporting the entire cell bandwidth. Only one P-BWP can be configured in a cell.

BWP Configuration

Figure 2   BWP Configuration in a 40-MHz PCell

Figure 2 shows the initial BWP setup at RRC

connection setup as well as the P-BWP and F-BWP, which are in use if the UE is

connected. The initial BWP is the same size as the P-BWP.

The UE initiates BWP configuration when it is required to change from idle mode to

connected mode:

1. The UE finds the SSB in the frequency domain without any location information.
2. The UE finds the Master Information Block (MIB) close to the SSB in the frequency domain.
3. The UE finds the CORESET#0 and the SIBs using the MIB information.
4. The UE continues with the connection procedure if it supports the initial BWP size configured in SIB1.
5. The gNodeB checks the UE capabilities.
6. If the UE only supports a bandwidth that is equal to the initial BWP, it stays configured to the P-BWP. If the UE supports a bandwidth that is equal to the carrier bandwidth, the gNodeB configures the F-BWP to the UE by RRC reconfiguration.

The UE initiates BWP configuration for SCells at each SCell configuration. The

selected BWP depends on SCell BWP configuration and UE capabilities. If the UE

supports a bandwidth that is equal to the SCell carrier bandwidth, the gNodeB

configures the UE with F-BWP on the SCell through RRC reconfiguration. If the UE

does not support a bandwidth that is equal to the SCell carrier bandwidth, but it

supports a bandwidth that is equal to the SCell P-BWP, the gNodeB configures the UE

with P-BWP on the SCell through RRC reconfiguration.

The following configurations determine if carrier aggregation is contiguous or

non-contiguous:

- The configuration of a component carrier
- The configuration of the P-BWP in a component carrier

Figure 3   Non-Contiguous Carrier Aggregation if P-BWP Is Configured in a Component

Carrier

BWP configuration is static. After the BWP is configured, no more BWP switches are

possible between P-BWP and F-BWP.

The SSB is required to be placed in the bandwidth range of the configured P-BWP. It

is recommended to configure the gNodeB to select the SSB frequency

automatically.

A dedicated PUCCH layout without frequency hopping is used to avoid PUSCH

fragmentation when an F-BWP is configured to the UE.

When the UEs are moved to another serving cell and multiple BWPs are enabled in the

target cell, the UEs are configured with the largest supported BWP.

## 3.1 FDD BWP Positioning

The FDD P-BWP has a 20-MHz bandwidth and can be placed in a bottom position or in a

top position on the cell bandwidth.

Figure 4   FDD BWP Positioning

The feature supports the following bandwidth on FDD cells:

- 25 MHz
- 30 MHz
- 35 MHz
- 40 MHz
- 50 MHz

The FDD P-BWP has a fixed 20-MHz bandwidth.

The FDD P-BWP can be placed in a bottom position or in a top position on the cell

bandwidth in the following ways:

- If the P-BWP is in a bottom position, it must be on the lowest edge of the cell bandwidth.
- If the P-BWP is in a top position, the P-BWP is moved down a number of PRBs from the highest edge. This aligns the PDCCH CCE configuration between P-BWP and F-BWP to avoid PDCCH fragmentation.

The P-BWP position can be set with the BWP.startRB attribute. For more

information, see FDD BWP Configuration for NR Reduced UE Bandwidth

Support.

For more information on bandwidth support, see  Physical Layer Low-Band.

Configuring NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support with the P-BWP might change the placement of

SSB in the cell and can have impact on the intra- and inter-frequency settings in the

following cases:

- The feature is enabled, and the P-BWP is set to a top position.
- The P-BWP is moved from a bottom position to a top position while the feature is active.
- The P-BWP is moved from a top position to a bottom position while the feature is active.

For more information, see Configuration of SSB Transmission Frequency

in Manage Radio Network.

## 3.2 TDD BWP Positioning

The TDD P-BWP is positioned at the bottom of the cell bandwidth.

Figure 5   TDD BWP Positioning

The feature supports the following bandwidth on TDD cells:

- 30 MHz
- 40 MHz
- 50 MHz
- 60 MHz
- 70 MHz
- 80 MHz
- 90 MHz
- 100 MHz

The TDD P-BWP uses a bandwidth that is smaller than the F-BWP, but larger or equal to 20

MHz.

The TDD P-BWP is placed in the bottom position of the cell bandwidth, except when the NR

Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature and the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature are

activated simultaneously. In this

case,

the blanked PRB is positioned at the bottom of the bandwidth, blocked out from the

F-BWP, while the P-BWP is moved above the blanked PRB.

For more information on bandwidth support, see Physical Layer Mid-Band.

## 3.3 NR Dynamic Power Optimizer and NR Reduced Bandwidth Support Feature Coexistence

The NR Dynamic Power Optimizer and the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support features can

be activated and used together in TDD cells. In this case, power saving can be configured on

both BWPs.

Figure 6 shows the procedure for UEs to go from

idle mode to connected mode if both the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support and the NR

Dynamic Power Optimizer features are activated.

Figure 6   RRC Procedure from Idle Mode to Connected Mode with Both NR Dynamic Power

Optimizer and NR Reduced Bandwidth Support Features

Activated

The RRC setup and configuration procedure is the following:

1. The UE uses the initial BWP configured in the SIB.
2. The gNodeB configures the P-BWP at RRC setup.
3. The gNodeB checks the UE capabilities. The gNodeB also checks UE capability for DCI switching support.
4. The following options are possible: If the UE only supports a bandwidth that is equal to the initial BWP, it stays configured to the P-BWP. If the UE supports a bandwidth that is equal to the carrier bandwidth, the gNodeB configures the F-BWP to the UE by RRC reconfiguration. If the UE supports DCI switching, and power saving is configured for both P-BWP and F-BWP, then two BWPs are configured for both. P-BWP1 + P-BWP2 and F-BWP1 + F-BWP2. DCI switching is used to change between BWP1 and BWP2. There is no DCI switching between P-BWP and F-BWP. For more information, see the NR Dynamic Power Optimizer and NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support features.

## 3.4 Flexible PDCCH Monitoring and NR Reduced Bandwidth Support Feature Coexistence

If the Flexible PDCCH Monitoring feature and the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

feature are used together, SSSG switching can be configured on both F-BWP and

P-BWP.

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature makes it possible to configure the cell with

a F-BWP, and configure a P-BWP for the same cell. The Flexible PDCCH Monitoring feature

uses this configuration for RedCap UEs that only support BWPs that are less

than or equal to 20 MHz.

The following procedure is used to configure UEs for F-BWP and P-BWP SSSG switching:

1. The UE uses the initial BWP configured in the System Information Block.
2. The gNodeB configures the P-BWP at RRC setup.
3. The gNodeB checks the UE capabilities.
4. The following options are possible: If the UE supports a bandwidth that is equal to the carrier bandwidth, the gNodeB configures the F-BWP for the UE. Otherwise, the UE stays configured for the P-BWP.
5. If the UE supports SSSG switching, two SSSGs are configured for P-BWP or F-BWP depending on which BWP is configured in the UE. SSSG switching is used to change between SSSG0 and SSSG1 in P-BWP or F-BWP. Note: SSSGs are configured on the cell level. The SSSGs used in P-BWP and the SSSGs used in F-BWP use the same configuration.

For more information, see the following documentation:

- Flexible PDCCH Monitoring
- NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

## 3.5 CRB Blanking in Cells with NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature and the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

feature can be activated simultaneously.

CRB Blanking in FDD Cells

CRB blanking is possible for FDD cells in the top of the full carrier bandwidth if

the P-BWP is configured in the bottom position of the cell bandwidth.

If the P-BWP is configured in a top position on the cell bandwidth, CRB blanking is

not allowed in any part of the bandwidth.

To use the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature, the following attributes are

required to be set to 0:

- NRCellDU.dlStartCrb
- NRCellDU.ulStartCrb

CRB blanking is not possible in the P-BWP. To not blank CRB in P-BWP, the

following attributes are required to be set to a value equal or higher than

106:

- NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs
- NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs

CRB Blanking in TDD Cells

CRB blanking is possible for TDD cells at the following parts of the bandwidth:

- The top of the full carrier bandwidth
- The bottom of the full carrier bandwidth Note: In this case the blanked CRB is positioned at the bottom of the bandwidth, blocked out from the F-BWP, while the P-BWP is moved above the blanked CRB.

If the blanked CRB is configured at the bottom of the bandwidth, the F-BWP

BWP.startRB value must be

0,

and the P-BWP must be configured according to the following rules:

- BWP.startRB for downlink P-BWP = round up to integer (NRCellDU.dlStartCrb / 6) × 6
- BWP.startRB for uplink P-BWP = round up to integer (NRCellDU.ulStartCrb / 6) × 6

In this case, the BWP.startRB attribute for downlink and uplink

P-BWP must have the same value, and the NRCellDU.dlStartCrb and

NRCellDU.ulStartCrb attributes must have the same value.

CRB blanking is not possible in the P-BWP. To not blank CRB in P-BWP, the following

attributes are required to be set to a value equal or higher than the value of the

BWP.numberOfRBs attribute in the P-BWP used by the cell:

- NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs
- NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs

# 4 Network Impact of NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The feature might affect cell throughput and affects the Uu interface.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases cell and UE throughput by allowing cells to be configured with

wider bandwidth, even if some of the UEs in the cell have reduced bandwidth

capabilities.

The F-BWP uplink throughput might be degraded because of PUSCH fragmentation if PUCCH

resources in a P-BWP are overlapped by an F-BWP.

For reciprocity-based multi-user MIMO and single-user MIMO P-BWP UEs in TDD

configurations using CRB blanking, low downlink throughput and high BLER is

expected.

Interfaces

This feature affects the following protocols on the Uu interface:

- RRC protocol The RRC uses the BWP configuration option 1. For more information about RRC BWP configuration option 1, see 3GPP TS 38.331 Annex B.2.
- Layer 1 protocol PDCCH DCI formats 0\_1 and 1\_1 use bit field Bandwidth Part Indicator.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The guidelines for configuring BWPs for FDD and TDD cells are different.

## 9.1 FDD BWP Configuration for NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature can be configured on FDD cells using MO

attributes.

The feature allows FDD cells to be configured with multiple BWPs. The MO attributes are

only required to be set if the cell has to be configured with multiple BWPs. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show recommended configuration

examples.

To configure a cell without multiple BWPs, the NRCellDu.bWPRef and

NRCellDU.bWPSetRef MO attributes must be left empty.

The BWP.startRB attribute is required to be set to 0

in case of F-BWPs. The BWP.startRB attribute is also required to be

set to 0 if the BWP0 and the P-BWP are placed in a bottom position on

the cell bandwidth.

If the BWP0 and the P-BWP are placed in a top position on the cell, there are required

values for the BWP.startRB attribute according to Table 3. This aligns the PDCCH CCE

configuration between the P-BWP and the F-BWP to avoid PDCCH fragmentation.

Table 3   Required Values of the BWP.startRB Parameter for FDD

P-BWPs in a Top Position

| Cell Bandwidth                                    |   25 MHz |   30 MHz |   35 MHz |   40 MHz |   50 MHz |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|

The BWP.numberOfRBs attribute is required to be set to

106 in case of P-BWPs, as currently only 20-MHz P-BWPs are

supported. For the required values for F-BWPs, see Table 4.

## 9.2 TDD BWP Configuration for NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature can be configured on TDD cells using MO

attributes.

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature can be configured on TDD cells independently,

or together with the NR Dynamic Power Optimizer feature.

The feature allows TDD cells to be configured with multiple BWPs. The MO attributes are

only required to be set if the cell has to be configured with multiple BWPs.

To configure a cell without multiple BWPs, the NRCellDu.bWPRef and

NRCellDU.bWPSetRef MO attributes must be left empty.

The BWP.startRB attribute is required to be set to 0

in case of F-BWPs. The BWP.startRB attribute is also required to be

set to 0 for the BWP0 and the P-BWP. If CRB blanking is configured in

the bottom, the initial BWP0 BWP.startRB attribute and the P-BWP

BWP.startRB attribute must be set according to CRB Blanking in Cells with NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support.

The BWP.numberOfRBs attribute is required to be set to specific

values for F-BWP and P-BWP cell bandwidth, as can be seen in Table 5

Table 5   Required Values of the BWP.numberOfRBs Parameter for TDD

F-BWPs and P-BWPs

| Cell Bandwidth   |   Required Value |
|------------------|------------------|
| 20 MHz(1)        |               51 |
| 30 MHz           |               78 |

The following BWP configuration options are supported on TDD cells:

- F-BWP and P-BWP with no power saving, see Figure 10
- F-BWP and P-BWP with power saving on both, see Figure 11

## 9.3 Feature Activation Interconnection in Carrier Aggregation with PCell and SCell in Different gNodeBs

If the PCell and the SCell are in different gNodeBs in carrier aggregation, the NR

Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature must be activated in both gNodeBs.

In

case of carrier aggregation over several gNodeBs, where the PCell is in one gNodeB and

the SCell in another gNodeB, the NR Reduced Bandwidth Support feature needs to be

activated in both gNodeBs so that the feature is supported in SCells.

Even

if the PCell does not need to support the feature, the feature is required to be

activated in that gNodeB.

For the feature activation interconnection process, see Figure 12 and Figure 13.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 23.Q3: NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support Mid-Band

This feature enhancement enables UEs with reduced bandwidth capabilities to use TDD

cells with wider bandwidth.

| Feature Name           | NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5442                      |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                          |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement increases cell and UE throughput by allowing TDD cells to

use wider bandwidth,

even

if some of the UEs in the cell only support smaller bandwidth.

This is achieved by supporting two BWPs in TDD cells with the following

bandwidths:

- 30 MHz
- 40 MHz
- 50 MHz
- 60 MHz
- 70 MHz
- 80 MHz
- 90 MHz
- 100 MHz

The TDD cell can be configured with the following BWPs:

- A Full BWP (F-BWP) that uses the entire cell bandwidth
- A Partial BWP (P-BWP) that uses a cell bandwidth that is smaller than the F-BWP, but larger or equal to 20 MHz The P-BWP is always placed in the bottom position of the cell bandwidth.

The following feature interactions apply to this enhancement:

- The NR Dynamic Power Optimizer and the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support features can be activated and used together. In this case, power saving can be configured on both BWPs.
- Aperiodic SRS is not supported when this feature enhancement is enabled.

This feature enhancement has the following limitations:

- TDD BWPs are not supported in SCells.
- This feature enhancement is not supported in EN-DC-only cells.

Capacity and Performance

The F-BWP uplink throughput might be degraded because of PUSCH fragmentation if PUCCH

resources in P-BWP are overlapped by an F-BWP.

Operation

With this enhancement, the range of the BWPSetUeCfg MO is changed

from 1..4 to 1..8.

The feature updates the Inconsistent Configuration alarm with the following

additional text that can be raised on the NRCellDU MO:

allBWPRegularRef=&lt;value&gt; inconsistent with activated

features: NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support, NR Dynamic Power

Optimizer.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the following protocols on the Uu interface:

- RRC protocol The RRC uses the BWP configuration option 1. For more information about RRC BWP configuration option 1, see 3GPP TS 38.331 Annex B.2.
- Layer 1 protocol PDCCH DCI formats 0\_1 and 1\_1 use bit field Bandwidth Part Indicator.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is not supported on the following RAN Compute Groups:

- RAN Compute Group 1
- RAN Compute Group 2
- RAN Compute Group 3

Other Network Elements

- ENM It is required to use ENM version 23.2 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.
- UE UE issues might result in the degradation of the NR standalone and NR non-standalone Retainability KPIs.

## Appendix A.b: 23.Q3: Added BWP Size Check and Improved PM Counter Handling for NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

This feature enhancement removes the array handling limitation related to the

BWPSet.allBWPRegularRef attribute and introduces a MOM configuration

check for the BWP.numbersOfRBs attribute.

| Feature Name           | NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5442                      |
| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement ensures that counter bin numbers and BWP instance indexes

match, therefore the elements in the BWPSet.allBWPRegularRef

attribute do not need to be created or put in alphabetical order.

The feature enhancement introduces a MOM configuration check for the

BWP.numberOfRBs attribute to ensure that only the correct

values corresponding to the supported BWP sizes are configured. This secures that

the BWP size is recognized during configuration, which means that the correct

configuration is checked earlier.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version

23.4

or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.

## Appendix A.c: 24.Q1.1: NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support in SCells

This feature enhancement enables UEs with reduced bandwidth capabilities to use

SCells with wider bandwidth in carrier aggregation.

| Feature Name           | NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5442                      |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                         |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the support of partial BWPs in SCells. Flexibility

is increased by solving the mismatch between the network bandwidth and the reduced

bandwidth capabilities of certain UE types.

When carrier aggregation is configured on an SCell with the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth

Support feature enabled, the SCell can be configured with one of following BWPs:

- An F-BWP that uses the entire cell bandwidth
- A P-BWP for UEs not supporting the entire cell bandwidth

The configuration of a component carrier and the configuration of the P-BWP in a

component carrier determine if carrier aggregation is contiguous or

non-contiguous.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement increases UE throughput as UEs with reduced bandwidth

capabilities can be configured with carrier aggregation. Depending on the number of

affected UEs with reduced bandwidth capabilities in the network, network throughput

can also increase.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to observe SCell

traffic:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellBwp
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellExtBwp
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlSCellBwp

This feature enhancement also updates the

NRCellDU.pmBwpUeConfSumDistr PM counter.

This

feature enhancement introduces the DuPerUeBwpConf PM event.
