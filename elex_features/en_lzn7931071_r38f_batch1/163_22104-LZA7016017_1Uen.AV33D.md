# 3 Feature Operation of Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit

The feature allows adaptive power backoff

in Mid-Band PDSCH transmissions, in eCPRI Massive MIMO radio units.

The feature adjusts the PDSCH power level for a UE in each group of resource blocks. The

adjustment depends on the number of layers that are transmitted. EIRP limitation scales

with the carrier bandwidth.

After PMI feedback, if the EIRP of the PDSCH is greater than the allowed EIRP threshold,

the system reduces the power of the PDSCH for each UE. The feature adaptively applies

different backoff values to the PDSCH based on the scheduled UEs in each TTI.

# 4 Network Impact of Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit

The feature can boost

PDSCH performance and retain the coverage of the downlink common channel.

Capacity and Performance

Compared to when the value of the

NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute is reduced to

satisfy the EIRP requirements, the feature boosts PDSCH performance and retains the

coverage of the downlink common channels.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit

The feature introduces

Also, even with the feature, it is recommended to set                                     this attribute so that the EIRP of the weakest channel is                                     restricted without needing to reduce power automatically. |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves cell throughput in small or medium macro cell by

allowing the operators to set a limit for EIRP instead of decreasing the value of

the NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. The maximum

allowed PSD is 2 W/MHz.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Increases cell coverage and improves the UE and cell throughput
- Reduces electromagnetic propagation in sensitive areas for EMF and EMC limit compliance and electronic device protection
- Reduces the probability of out-of-band blocking of other operators
- Provides instantaneous power backoff on PDSCH while maintaining throughput degradation
