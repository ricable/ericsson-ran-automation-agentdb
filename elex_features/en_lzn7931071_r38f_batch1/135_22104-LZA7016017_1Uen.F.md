Summary

The NR Restricted Drive Test feature enables the operator to override checking for user

consent when collecting measurements using the NR Minimization of Drive Tests

feature. Such measurements might include personal data.

Privacy and legal concerns dictate that collection of personal data requires user consent.

Accordingly, the NR Restricted Drive Test feature has restricted availability, and

it is only available by special request. Conditions for use have to comply with one

of the following use cases:

- Requested for MDT trials with test UEs for a short duration, not longer than two months.
- Requested by customer personnel with suitable authority, who provides notice that the country does not have laws that govern the requirement for user consent. The request must be renewed annually.
- Requested by customer personnel with suitable authority, who provides notice that the legal obligation for user consent is secured by other means. However, they do not implement user consent in their core network. The request must be renewed annually.
