Summary

With this feature, operators can prioritize the downlink carrier aggregation traffic that goes

to an external SCell. For example, a similar traffic priority can be configured in

the SpCell and the external SCell, or the external traffic can be prioritized

relative to the local SCell traffic.

The feature can also provide QoS-aware traffic differentiation, which is expected to provide

higher throughput in the external SCell for high-priority traffic.

Different priority modes can be selected using the

ExtCaPriority.adjustedPriorityMode attribute. This attribute

is set in the external SCell, which is then transferred to the SpCell to control the

priority of the traffic forwarded to the configured SCell. The following priority

modes can be used:

| Static Priority Mode without Priority Policing   |    | This is the default priority mode and it is used to configure a fixed 								QoS priority for external traffic in the SCell. Traffic with QoS 								priority below the configured priority can be scheduled in the 								external SCell. If the default values are used, external traffic is 								scheduled with the default priority.                    |

| Dynamic Priority Mode                            |    | This mode is used to select dynamic priority for external traffic in 								the external SCell. The dynamic QoS priority levels are controlled 								by the SpCell based on the traffic demand in the SpCell and 								congestion status of the SCell. Traffic with QoS priority below the 								selected priority is not scheduled in the external SCell. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

QoS information is not transferred across the E5 link on a DRB basis. Therefore, when

the QoS priority is mapped from the SpCell to the external SCell, the priority

behavior of the external traffic in the external SCell is an approximation of the

priority behavior in the SpCell.

Network Requirements

- EPC EPC must include the QCI to fulfill the requirements for traffic differentiation of DRBs in EN-DC deployment.
- ENM It is required to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
- UE The UE must support downlink carrier aggregation as specified in 3GPP TS 38.101.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

The feature enables the

prioritization

of SpCell traffic in the external SCell relative to the priority of the

local SCell traffic. The feature also provides QoS-based traffic

differentiation.

With this feature, the QoS priority can be sent to the external SCell for traffic that is

sent from an SpCell to an external SCell in inter-capacity module carrier

aggregation.

Depending on the configured priority mode, the feature also provides QoS-based traffic

differentiation, which means that only data with high enough QoS priority is scheduled

for external traffic. The SpCell traffic that goes to an external SCell must have a

higher QoS priority than the common priority threshold set for the external traffic.

With all priority modes, a common priority for the data that is forwarded to the

external SCell is set by assigning a priority to the inter-capacity module connection

itself, referred to as the pipe. The pipe carries the external traffic from the SpCell

node to the external SCell.

The pipe is a virtual connection between advanced RAN coordination partners that are

connected by an E5 interface in an advanced RAN coordination deployment. This means that

the pipe can connect an SpCell that is in a node or a capacity module with an external

SCell that is in another node or another capacity module.

The priority of the pipe is applied to all external traffic that passes through it,

therefore, all external traffic has the same priority when it arrives in the external

SCell. This priority is used to differentiate traffic in the SCell

between

the external traffic coming from an SpCell and the local SCell traffic.

The priority of the pipe and the behavior of the feature is based on the configuration of

the ExtCaPriority MO class and its attributes. The attributes are

configured in the external SCell. The configuration is then automatically transferred to

the SpCell to control the priority of the traffic that is forwarded from the SpCell to

the external SCell.

Operational Process

The feature operation depends on the selected priority mode, so an example is used to

describe the operational process. In this example, a static priority mode is used by

setting the STATIC\_PRIO\_WITH\_POLICING value for the

ExtCaPriority.adjustedPriorityMode attribute. In this

priority mode, traffic in the SpCell that has lower priority than the configured

priority is not scheduled for external carrier aggregation.

For more information about priority modes, see Operation Modes and Configuration Management.

Figure 1   Operational Process with an Example of Static Priority Mode with Priority

Policing

1. Different types of traffic in the SpCell have different priorities based on the QoS settings for each DRB.
2. The traffic goes through the scheduler in the SpCell. The traffic that has lower priority than the priority set for the pipe is not scheduled as external traffic.
3. External traffic is sent through the pipe to the external SCell. The DRB-level QoS priorities are not preserved when passing through the pipe. Instead, all the external traffic going from an SpCell to an external SCell is assigned with one common priority, in this example, priority k.
4. The external traffic goes into the scheduler of the external SCell. The external traffic that comes from the SpCell is scheduled together with the local traffic of the external SCell.
5. The scheduler in the external SCell sends the traffic for transmission over the air interface. The air interface resources are assigned to traffic based on their priority in the external SCell.

## 3.1 Operation Modes and Configuration Management

The feature behavior is defined by the configured operation mode.

Different

operation modes enable different levels of prioritization, from using the default settings

with no prioritization to a dynamic mode, where the priority of the external traffic changes

based on the traffic demand and the level of congestion.

The feature behavior is configured with the attributes of the

ExtCaPriority MO. The priority mode is set using the

ExtCaPriority.adjustedPriorityMode attribute. The possible

operation modes are described in Table 2.

The attributes of the ExtCaPriority MO class are set in the cell that

is used as an external SCell. Therefore, the

NRCellDU.extCaPriorityRef attribute on the

NRCellDU MO instance of the external SCell

must

reference the ExtCaPriority MO instance used for

the configuration.

Figure 2   External SCell Traffic When Using Static Priority without Priority

Policing

Figure 2 shows an inter-capacity module

connection where the local traffic in the SpCell has different priorities ranging

from priority 1 to priority n.

When the SpCell traffic is forwarded to the

external SCell, all forwarded traffic is assigned a static common priority in the

pipe, in this example, priority k. Priority k is configured with the

ExtCaPriority.priorityDomainBase and

ExtCaPriority.relativePriorityBase attributes. The scheduler

in the external SCell uses priority k for external SpCell traffic when it

prioritizes the external traffic originating from the SpCell and the local SCell

traffic.

Traffic in the SpCell with priority n is also forwarded to the

external SCell, and it is assigned priority k in the pipe.

Figure 3 shows an inter-capacity module

When the SpCell traffic is forwarded to the

external SCell, all forwarded traffic is assigned a static common priority in the

pipe, in this example, priority k. Priority k is configured with the

ExtCaPriority.priorityDomainBase and the

ExtCaPriority.relativePriorityBase attributes. The scheduler

in the external SCell uses priority k for external SpCell traffic when it

prioritizes the external traffic originating from the SpCell and the local SCell

traffic.

Traffic in the SpCell below priority k, in this example, priority n,

is not forwarded to the external SCell.

When using this operation mode, the pipe starts at minimum priority

that can increase over time. The maximum priority that the pipe can reach is limited

by the lower of the following priorities:

- The highest traffic priority in the SpCell
- The priority selected using the ExtCaPriority.priorityDomainLimit and the ExtCaPriority.relativePriorityLimit attributes

The priority changes based on the traffic demand in the SpCell and the

congestion level of the external SCell. Any traffic with the same or higher priority

than the priority of the pipe can be sent from the SpCell to the external SCell. The

scheduler in the SCell uses the actual priority of the pipe for external SpCell

traffic when it prioritizes the external traffic originating from the SpCell and the

local SCell traffic in the external SCell.

The priority of the pipe resets to

a minimum priority when traffic is not forwarded through the E5 interface for some

period of time.

Figure 4   External SCell Traffic When Using Dynamic Priority Mode with No SCell

Congestion

Figure 4 shows an inter-capacity module

connection where the local traffic in the SpCell has different priorities ranging

from priority 1 to priority n. When the SpCell traffic is sent to the external

SCell, all forwarded traffic is assigned a common priority, which starts at the

minimum value.

When the traffic in the external SCell is

congested, the pipe serving the inter-capacity module connection shrinks in

proportion with the congestion level.

Figure 5   Congested External SCell Traffic When Using Dynamic Priority

Figure 5 shows the same traffic case as

Example 3, but the external SCell is

congested. The external SCell sends congestion feedback to the SpCell and the pipe

shrinks, reducing the total volume of the traffic that is forwarded. If the

congestion level is still high, the pipe priority is also raised to match the

priority of the traffic in the SpCell with the next highest priority. SpCell traffic

that has priority below priority k is not forwarded to the external SCell. In this

example, traffic with priority 2 has a lower traffic volume than the traffic with

priority 1, and traffic with priority n is not forwarded to the external SCell. The

SpCell traffic is scheduled to go through the pipe in priority order.

# 4 Network Impact of NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

Downlink throughput is increased for high-priority traffic, while low-priority

traffic can be degraded.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink DRB throughput is expected to increase for high-priority traffic.

Low-priority traffic can be degraded if the selected priority mode

and

the congestion level of the external SCell restrict the traffic

from using external carrier aggregation.

The

feature might have a negative impact on KPIs in the following

cases:

- Traffic can shift between partner cells in an Advanced RAN Coordination deployment, changing traffic load significantly.
- PDCCH and PUCCH resource contention can reduce the efficiency of the feature.

If a static priority mode is selected and the priority of the pipe is high, the

priority of the external traffic can be higher than the local traffic in the

external SCell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

The feature introduces the ExtCaPriority MO class to configure a

priority mode and a priority for the SpCell traffic sent to the external SCell. The feature

is configured in the cell that is used as an SCell for inter-capacity module carrier

aggregation.

# 6 Performance of NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

The feature is associated with QoS-based KPIs and PM counters related to throughput,

latency, DRB volume, and

time.

The benefit of the feature is best observable when the traffic volume in the cells is high

enough to cause resource contention.

KPIs

- DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS Downlink DRB throughput is expected to increase for high-priority traffic.
- Average DL MAC DRB Latency per QoS covering non-DRX in-sync
- Average DL MAC DRB Latency per QoS covering DRX in-sync
- Average Overall DL Latency per QoS

Performance Indicators

- Average of DL MAC Contention Delay per QoS per Cell The Average of DL MAC Contention Delay per QoS per Cell Performance Indicator can be calculated the following way:

Counters

The

following

PM counters and EBS counter can be used to observe changes in DRB

volume and time for HARQ initial transmissions for each QoS priority:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbLastSlotQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbSampQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbLastSlotQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbLastSlotSampQos
- pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbSingleBurst

The following counters can be used to observe latency for each QoS priority:

- NRCellDU.pmMacLatTimeDlNoDrxSyncQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacLatTimeDlNoDrxSyncSampQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacLatTimeDlDrxSyncQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacLatTimeDlDrxSyncSampQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacContentionDelayDlMaxQos

The following counters can be used for unrestricted data volume and time with QoS:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurstQoS
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurstQoS

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, the prerequisites must be fulfilled and the license key must be

activated in the node. For the feature to provide its benefits, the

ExtCaPriority MO instance must be configured, and additional

instances can be created in the same node.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node that has the cell that is to be used as an SpCell.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The following prerequisite features are activated: Priority-Controlled Scheduling NR Relative Priority Scheduling Advanced RAN Coordination
- At least one of the NR downlink carrier aggregation feature variants listed in Dependencies of NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation is activated and configured for the cells to be used with the NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation feature.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012658 MO instance in the node that has the cell that is to be used as an SpCell. Result: An ExtCaPriority MO instance is created with default values.
2. Set the attributes of the ExtCaPriority MO instance to the desired values.
3. Optional: Optionally, do the following steps for each additional cell that is to be used as an SCell with this feature on the same node:
    1. Create an ExtCaPriority MO instance.
    2. Set the attributes of the ExtCaPriority MO instance to the desired values.
    3. Set the NRCellDU.extCaPriorityRef attribute of the external SCell to reference the created ExtCaPriority MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012658 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guideline for NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation

It is recommended to introduce the feature gradually to avoid performance degradation

in the network.

The feature might degrade network performance if a static priority mode is selected, and

a high pipe priority is set at feature activation. With a high pipe priority, the local

traffic in the external SCell could have lower priority than the external traffic. It is

recommended to set a lower priority for the pipe initially and increase it

gradually

to avoid reducing the performance of SCell local traffic.

The feature can behave inconsistently if priorities are inconsistent among

cells due to

different configurations

of

the PriorityDomainMapping MO instances. The

configuration of the attributes

of

the ExtCaPriority MO instance should be consistent

with the attributes of the PriorityDomainMapping MO instances to

ensure consistent priority behavior.
