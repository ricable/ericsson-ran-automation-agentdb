# 1 NR Carrier Aggregation Data Steering Overview

The feature supports PCell downlink data offload and the configuration of the buffer

splitting threshold.

Summary

The feature makes it possible to offload low-volume data from an FDD PCell to the

SCell with the largest pipe size, that is, that can send the most data. Low-volume

data refers to any data smaller than the buffer splitting threshold. Offloading data

frees up the resources of the FDD PCell.

The feature allows the configuration of the buffer splitting threshold, even with the

PCell downlink data offload function disabled.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Carrier Aggregation Data Steering

The feature has dependencies with features related to carrier aggregation

management.

However, the             Data-Aware Carrier Management feature keeps SCells deactivated to save UE battery life.             Therefore, a tradeoff must be made by configuring the Data-Aware Carrier Management             feature for aggressive SCell activation. Any transmission shorter than the SCell             activation window is scheduled on the PCell. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- Short UE sessions might not be offloaded because of the SCell activation delay.
- Data can only be offloaded to one SCell.
- The feature can only be enabled in FDD PCells.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Carrier Aggregation Data Steering

The feature allows incoming buffer data to be directed to the SCell with the largest

pipe size. The buffer splitting threshold can be configured with the PCell downlink data

offload function enabled or disabled.

PCell Downlink Data Offload

PCell downlink data offload can be enabled by setting the

NRCellDU.pCellDlDataOffload attribute to true. With PCell

downlink data offload enabled, if the data in buffer for an FDD PCell is smaller

than the buffer splitting threshold, the data can be offloaded to the SCell with the

largest pipe size. If the pipe size of the PCell is larger than any of the SCells,

the data is not offloaded to an SCell. The pipe size depends on the number of

resource blocks in the bandwidth and the radio conditions.

Figure 1   Data Splitting with and without PCell Offload

SRB traffic stays on the FDD PCell to ensure radio link robustness. Other traffic,

for example VoNR, can also be kept on the PCell by using the User- and

Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation feature.

The level of data offload depends on the following factors:

- Data volume generated by UEs not configured for carrier aggregation cannot be offloaded.
- Short duration sessions cannot be offloaded because SCells cannot be activated in time.
- Data volume from a long enough session for SCell activation is offloaded.

Figure 2 shows an example of how the level of

data offload changes with enabling PCell downlink data offload. The data that is not

offloaded is handled by the PCell.

Figure 2   Data Volume Distribution Example with PCell Data Offload

Table 2 describes what happens when PCell

downlink data offload is used with different priority mode settings. For more

information about the priority modes, see NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier

Aggregation.

Buffer Splitting Threshold

If the data in buffer is larger than the buffer splitting threshold and the session

is long enough for SCell activation, the data is scheduled to at least one SCell.

The buffer splitting threshold can be configured by the

NRCellDU.caBufferSplitThresh attribute.

If PCell downlink data offload is disabled, a lower buffer splitting threshold can

result in more external carrier aggregation as more data is scheduled to the SCells.

Because of this, the use of external carrier aggregation can be increased by setting

a lower value for the NRCellDU.caBufferSplitThresh attribute, and

decreased by setting a higher value.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Carrier Aggregation Data Steering

The feature provides more control over carrier aggregation data traffic.

Capacity and Performance

PCell downlink data offload can free up resources for the FDD PCell.

With PCell downlink data offload disabled, the use of external carrier aggregation

can be increased by setting the buffer splitting threshold to a lower value, and

decreased by setting it to a higher value.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
