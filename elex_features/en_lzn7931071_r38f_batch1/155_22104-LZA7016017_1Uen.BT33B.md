Summary

This feature allows downlink carrier aggregation with four component carriers among up to

three

Advanced RAN Coordination partners. The Advanced RAN Coordination partners

(gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules) are connected by an E5 link by the Advanced RAN

Coordination feature.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Increased downlink peak throughput
- More efficient use of scattered spectrum

# 2 Dependencies of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature uses the Advanced RAN Coordination feature for carrier aggregation

between gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules. The performance is limited by UE capabilities and

cell configurations.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

- For FDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 900 μs.
- For TDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 350 μs.
- Only NR standalone deployment is supported.
- For TDD-TDD carrier aggregation, the PCell and SCell must have the same TDD patterns.
- The feature is not supported where the PCell has 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured and the SCells have more than 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured.
- UE throughput might decrease in sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three or more component carriers due to reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH. This is also valid when some or all the component carriers are external.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

## 2.1 Downlink Carrier Aggregation Features in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The NR downlink carrier aggregation features in Low-Band and Mid-Band use the same

SCell selection algorithm.

If a carrier aggregation feature with a higher number of component carriers is enabled,

the carrier aggregation features with a lower number of component carriers are also

enabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature allows the aggregation of four component carriers between up to three

gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules. The Advanced RAN Coordination feature provides the E5 link

connectivity between the gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules.

The UE connects to the PCell at the gNodeB, which triggers the execution of the SCell

selection functionality. If possible, the carrier aggregation-capable UE is configured

with three downlink SCells. The selected SCells are configured and activated as

described for the NR DL Carrier Aggregation feature.

|---------|------------------------|------------------------|

All configurations of capacity modules and gNodeBs are possible for the supported duplex

mode combinations. However, the following restrictions apply:

- Carriers in the same capacity module must have the same duplex mode.
- Only one capacity module can use FDD duplex mode at a time in a gNodeB. Two capacity modules in the same gNodeB both using FDD duplex mode is not a possible configuration.

# 4 Network Impact of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves cell utilization and increases UE downlink

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cell utilization is expected to improve because downlink data transmission is

distributed across multiple component carriers. UE downlink throughput is increased

by aggregating four component carriers.

In sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three

or more component carriers (some or all external), UE throughput might decrease by

reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following interfaces to ensure that multiple SCells can be

configured at the same time:

- Uu interface The size of the RRCReconfiguration message increases.
- F1 interface The size of the UE Context Modification message increases.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

Additional PUCCH resources can be allocated by an existing attribute. SCells must be

on a different frequency than the PCell.

# 7 Activate NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated in the appropriate MO instance. Additional

PUCCH resource must be allocated in the cell for carrier aggregation to avoid downlink

throughput degradation.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012650 MO instance.
2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to true.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

When the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. If a cell is not intended to be used as PCell for carrier

aggregation, the additional PUCCH allocation must be disabled.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012650 MO instance.

If the cell is not intended to be used as PCell for carrier aggregation, do the

following:

2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to false.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
