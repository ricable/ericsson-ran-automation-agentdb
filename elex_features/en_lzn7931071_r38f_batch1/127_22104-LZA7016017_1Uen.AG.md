Hardware Requirements

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

DRX retransmission timers are only valid for Low-Band and Mid-Band frequencies.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements are expected for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Adaptive DRX

This feature introduces support for UE group differentiation.

The

following options apply:

- If the NRCellDU.drxProfileRef MO attribute is empty, the MO attributes with the default value of DrxProfileUeCfg MO class are used.
- If the NRCellDU.drxProfileRef MO is not empty, the MO attributes of the selected DrxProfileUeCfg MO class are used.

The various MO instances must be differentiated with the following attributes:

- DrxProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.ueConfGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList

## 3.1 Optimization of DRX

DRX settings can be optimized for the DRX profiles that are configured for specific

UE groups.

Different DRX profiles can be configured for specific UEs and subscribers. The DRX

settings can be optimized by using the following attributes for each UE group:

- DrxProfileUeCfg.drxOnDurationTimer
- DrxProfileUeCfg.drxLongCycle
- DrxProfileUeCfg.drxInactivityTimer
- DrxProfileUeCfg.drxRetransmissionTimerUl
- DrxProfileUeCfg.drxRetransmissionTimerDl

This way, the UE battery consumption can be reduced for specific services, such as

VoNR, while maintaining a good end-user experience.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Adaptive DRX

NR Service-Adaptive DRX enables the fine tuning of DRX behavior for the respective

service by using UE groups.

Capacity and Performance

This feature balances the use of radio resources and reduces UE energy

consumption.

In some cases, the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxOnDurationTimer might

overlap with the measurement gap if DRX is reconfigured after the measurement gap

has been configured. For example, when CSI-RS periodicity uses the same or a larger

value than the measurement gap repetition period. This results in UE throughput

degradation.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for new MOs.

# 5 Parameters of NR Service-Adaptive DRX

This feature introduces parameters related to DRX profile configuration for UE

groups.

| Access Type:            | NR                        |

Summary and Benefits

With this enhancement, DRX profiles can be configured separately for UE groups and

preference UE groups as required by the different features, functions, and function

areas.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Provides flexible DRX configuration.
- Reduces battery consumption based on the differentiated UE groups and the required services without decreasing system performance.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement increases UE responsiveness and reduces battery consumption

for UE groups and preference UE groups in High-Band cells.

Operation

The NRCellDU.drxProfileEnabled attribute is configured for DRX.

When the NRCellDU.drxProfileEnabled attribute is set to

true, the NRCellDU.drxProfileRef attribute

references the DrxProfileUeCfg MO.

A single DrxProfileUeCfg MO instance is created automatically.

Other DrxProfileUeCfg MO instances can be created manually. The

various MO instances can be differentiated with the following MO attributes:

- DrxProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList

The following PM events are updated to allow observability of the feature:

- CuCpProcEndcSetup
- CuCpProcEndcRelease
- CuCpProcX2SgnbChange
- CuCpProcX2SnInitiatedSgnbModification

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q2: MOM Configuration Rule Change for UE Grouping-Related Attributes

This feature enhancement introduces a non-backward-compatible change for an existing

MOM configuration rule in three MO classes. With this change, the affected classes apply the

MOM configuration rule that is required by the UE Grouping Framework.

Summary and Benefits

MO classes that are adapted to the UE Grouping Framework feature contain a standard

set of UE group list attributes and a standard set of MOM configuration rules, which

enforce the correct setting of the UE group list attributes. This feature

enhancement introduces a non-backward-compatible change for one of the MOM

configuration rules related to the three affected MO classes, which are already

adapted to the UE Grouping Framework. This is to comply with the corresponding

standard UE Grouping Framework configuration rule.

The affected attributes comply with the following standard MOM configuration rule

after the change:

- For each preference UE group identifier that is defined in one or several UeCfg MO instances apart from the Base instance, there must be exactly one UeCfg MO instance that combines the specific preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute with an empty ueGroupList attribute.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The change affects the following MO classes and attributes:

- DUModified5qiUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList

No upgrade conversion of the configuration is made by the system during node

upgrade.

The first time the MOM configuration rule is enforced after a software upgrade is

when a configuration transaction contains any changes related to the affected

UeCfg MO classes. This is true even if the configuration

transaction does not affect any values related to the

prefUeGroupList or the ueGroupList

attributes. This means that an existing configuration that does not comply with the

updated configuration rules is still used after the software update. The

non-compliant configuration is detected by the system only if a configuration

transaction affecting the MO classes is initiated.

The enforcement of the updated configuration rule causes behavior changes. The most

common examples are the following:

- Any MO transaction that contains configuration changes related to any of the affected UeCfg MO classes must always fulfill the updated configuration rule.
- It is not possible to create a UeCfg MO instance if the following conditions apply: The prefUeGroupList attribute includes a new preference UE group identifier, which is not included in any of the existing UeCfg MO instances and their prefUeGroupList attributes. The ueGroupList attribute is non-empty. The only exception is if the same MO transaction also includes the creation of a second UeCfg MO instance with the same new preference UE group identifier in the uePrefGroupList attribute combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute for this UeCfg MO instance.
- It is not possible to delete a UeCfg MO instance if the following conditions apply: The MO instance contains a preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute. There is another UeCfg MO instance with the same preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute combined with a non-empty ueGroupList attribute. The only exception is if both MO instances are deleted in the same MO transaction.
- If the prefUeGroupList attribute is empty with no previous configurations for all UeCfg MO instances, there is no impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.
