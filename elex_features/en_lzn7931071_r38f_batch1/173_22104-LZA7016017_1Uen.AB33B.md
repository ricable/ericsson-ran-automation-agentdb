Summary

This feature introduces the support of power-based closed-loop power control. The

gNodeB can instruct the UE to correct the transmission power, which can help with

full pathloss mitigation and obtaining an uplink SINR with which maximum throughput

can be secured.

The feature is configured on the UE group level, using the

PowerControlUeCfg.puschPowerControlModeFr1 attribute. The

value of the target transmission power is the total received PSD.

On the gNodeB side, the PowerControlUeCfg.pZeroNomPuschOffset

attribute can provide additional offset. This value does not affect the P0 value,

but provides an offset relative to the P0 affecting only the PUSCH received PSD

target of the gNodeB. Other gNodeB targets are also changed by the same amount for

the following targets:

- 64-QAM modulation
- 256-QAM modulation
- Uplink Single-User MIMO feature enabled with more than one layer

The feature supports NR Standalone and EN-DC deployments on Low-Band and Mid-Band

frequencies.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improves peak UE uplink throughput maintenance
- Provides MO configuration for closed-loop power control in the UE Grouping Framework
- Decreases UE energy consumption
- Can help mitigate the effects of remote interference

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band

The feature provides dynamic transmission power control to help maximize the uplink

throughput.

When the feature is enabled and closed-loop power control is used for uplink

transmission, the gNodeB sends constant feedback to the UE to improve power adjustment

accuracy in varying channel conditions. For this purpose, the gNodeB compares the PUSCH

total received PSD with the total received PSD target value. Depending on the result,

the gNodeB sends a Transmit Power Control (TPC) command to the UE to adjust the

transmission power when necessary. Using the closed-loop power control feature does not

regulate the P0 value of the UE, however, it enables the gNodeB to send feedback to the

UEs depending on whether the transmission power needs adjustment or not.

Total received PSD is the signal strength, including interference, received by the

gNodeB. The uplink total received PSD target, which includes the value of the

NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute, is calculated by the

gNodeB. This target is increased based on whether a 64-QAM modulation, a 256-QAM

modulation, or the Uplink Single-User MIMO feature is used with

more than one layer. The auto-selected P0 is balanced with the uplink received PSD

target of the gNodeB for 64-QAM.

The uplink transmission power of the UE is defined by the P0 value, defined by the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute.

The closed-loop power control can be used with the value of the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute set to

1000, in which case the system auto-selects the P0 value that can

be observed using the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute.

When the P0 value is auto-selected, the gNodeB optimizes the P0 based on the radio unit

and the value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute to

match the particular radio deployment. This usually matches the total received PSD

target of the gNodeB better than when the P0 is manually set.

By configuring the value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset

attribute to a value lower or higher than the default value, the feature can prioritize

either interference mitigation or the maintenance of peak uplink throughput.

Uplink closed-loop power control can be applied to mitigate the effects of remote

interference. The uplink total received power target of the UEs in non-power limited

cases is increased, which reduces the PUSCH performance degradation caused by remote

interference.

When the NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled, additional PSD P0

offset can be added for PUSCH by setting the

PowerControlUeCfg.pZeroNomPuschOffset attribute to a non-zero

value, depending on which UE group the UE belongs to. This attribute adjusts the power

target for UEs in specific UE groups. When the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to

1000, the values of both the

NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset and the

PowerControlUeCfg.pZeroNomPuschOffset attributes are considered

as offset added, meaning that the value of the

PowerControlUeCfg.pZeroNomPuschOffset attribute does not replace

the offset value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset

attribute.

Some UEs might keep using open-loop power control for a long

time, especially long duration FWA Customer Premises Equipment. Depending on the ratio

of UEs using open-loop power control in the cell and on the new P0 value , the KPIs that

monitor the performance of the NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band feature are

affected. In this case, locking and unlocking the cell might help to increase the

benefit of the feature.

# 7 Activate NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012673 MO instance.
2. Select an instance other than powerControlUeCfg=Base for the UE group.
3. Set the PowerControlUeCfg.puschPowerControlModeFr1 attribute to POWER\_BASED\_CLPC.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012673 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
