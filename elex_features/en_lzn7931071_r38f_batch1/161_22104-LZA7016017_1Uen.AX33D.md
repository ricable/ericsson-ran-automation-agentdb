Summary

Certain weather conditions might cause atmospheric ducts, which might cause

interference between downlink and uplink slots in remote TDD cells.

When the feature is activated and the appropriate functions are enabled, the gNodeBs

of the victim and aggressor cells transmit and receive specific

reference

signals

to

indicate, locate, and help mitigate remote

interference.

Remote interference mitigation methods reduce interference in remote cells and

improve cell and UE throughput.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Remote Interference Management

The feature requires the NR Remote Interference Detection feature to operate and has

other conflicting features.

![Image](../images/161_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AX33D/additional_3_CP.png)

Hardware

The feature is only supported for RAN Compute units in the following RAN Compute

groups:

- RAN Compute group 5, except 5e
- RAN Compute group 6

The feature is supported for radio units in Radio group 42.

The feature is not supported for radio units in Radio group 43.

The remote interference downlink power control function is only supported on AIR

3219.

The remote interference location function supports only a limited channel bandwidth

of 48 PRBs for RIM-RS for AIR 6454 and AIR 6488 radio units.

For the following radio units, the position of the RIM-RSs in the frequency domain,

defined by the RimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList struct member of the

RimRSGlobal.frequencyDomainPara attribute, must be fully

contained for each radio and carrier bandwidth in only one allowed PRB range:

- AIR 3239
- AIR 6454
- AIR 6488

For more information, see Engineering

Guidelines.

Limitations

The feature is supported only in NR Mid-Band TDD cells.

The feature supports only the following TDD patterns with special slot configuration

6:4:4:

- DDDSU UDDDD
- DDDDD DDSUU
- DDDSU UUUDD

The feature supports only the following TDD patterns with special slot configuration

3:8:3:

- DDDSU UDDDD
- DDDSU DDSUU
- DDDSU

The feature supports only the following TDD patterns with special slot configuration

10:2:2:

- DDDSU DDSUU
- DDDSU

The feature supports only the DDDSU UDDDD TDD pattern with special slot configuration

4:6:4.

The following limitations apply to the remote interference location and remote

interference-triggered offload functions:

- The function supports only NR Standalone and EN-DC deployments.
- The function is supported only on Massive MIMO and Remote eCPRI-based radio units.

The following limitations apply to the remote interference-triggered offload

function:

- The function supports only NR Standalone deployments.
- The functions are supported only on Massive MIMO eCPRI-based radio units.

The remote interference location and the remote interference-triggered offload

functions must not be enabled at the same time. This way, the remote interference

location function can control the remote interference-triggered offload

function.

The following limitations apply to the PDSCH slot-based blanking function:

- The function supports only NR Standalone and EN-DC deployments.
- RACH requests are rejected when blanking is ongoing.
- Blank PDCCH symbols are not supported.
- When the remote interference location function is enabled, the limitations of the function also apply to the PDSCH slot-based blanking function.
- Due to the limited number of downlink slots in some of the TDD patterns, the following restrictions apply to the downlink mitigation PDSCH slot blanking function: For the DDDSUDDSUU and the DDSUUUUDD TDD patterns, blanking is limited to one special slot and the first downlink slot before the special slot. For the DDDSU TDD pattern, blanking is limited to the special slot. Note: Due to the limitation, there are no far RIM-RS type 1 transmissions. Therefore, the detection of such propagation delay ranges is not possible.

The symbol-based blanking function is valid only for the DDSUDDSUU TDD pattern.

The following limitations apply to the remote interference downlink power control

function:

- The function supports only the NR Standalone deployment.
- The function is only supported in deployments with 30-kHz subcarrier spacing and 100-MHz bandwidth.
- The function does not support the full range of RIM-RS global parameters.
- The function supports deployments only with the DDDSUUDDDD TDD pattern.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes and the EBS counters introduced by this feature. If the Release

Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier

ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Remote Interference Management

With this feature, the remote interference can be located and both the interference

and the effects can be mitigated.

The following interference cases are possible:

- The interference is symmetric. Symmetric interference means that the victim cell is also an aggressor cell.
- The interference is asymmetric. Asymmetric interference means that the aggressor cell is not a victim cell.

The feature uses specific reference signals (RSs) to indicate, locate, and help mitigate

remote interference, sent and received by the gNodeB of the victim and the aggressor

cell.

When remote interference is detected, the remote interference location function helps

identify the location of the remote interference. This is done by the victim cell on the

gNodeB transmitting RIM-RS type 1 messages that are received by the aggressor cell on

the gNodeB. The quantity of uplink symbols affected by remote interference in the victim

cell can also be determined.

Figure 1 shows the feature operation, based on

the NR RIM-Location Framework-1.

Figure 1   NR RIM-Location Framework-1

When the RIM-RS type 1 is received by the gNodeB of the aggressor cell, the cell starts

downlink mitigation through, for example, slot blanking, if the PDSCH slot-based

blanking function is enabled.

The aggressor cell on the gNodeB starts the transmission of RIM-RS type 2 based on the

information contained in the received RIM-RS type 1 transmission.

If the aggressor cell on the gNodeB transmits RIM-RS type 2 but atmospheric ducting is no

longer present, the victim cell on the gNodeB does not receive the transmission. This is

because the ducting no longer exists.

If the victim cell receives a RIM-RS type 2 transmission but does not detect any remote

interference, then the cell is aware that the ducting is present and continues to

transmit RIM-RS type 1 transmissions.

The aggressor cell on the gNodeB stops the transmission of RIM-RS type 2 if no RIM-RS

type 1 transmission is received.

Table 2 shows the maximum configurable

bandwidth for RIM-RS for each carrier bandwidth in PRB.

Table 2   Maximum Configurable RIM-RS Bandwidth for Each Carrier Bandwidth

| Carrier Bandwidth Frequency   |   Subcarrier Spacing (kHz) |   5 MHz |   10 MHz |   15 MHz |   20 MHz |   25 MHz |   30 MHz |   35 MHz |   40 MHz |   50 MHz |   60 MHz |   70 MHz |   80 MHz |   90 MHz |   100 MHz |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Carrier Bandwidth in PRB      |                         30 |      11 |       24 |       38 |       51 |       65 |       78 |       92 |      106 |      133 |      162 |      189 |      217 |      245 |       273 |
| Maximum RIM-RS Bandwidth      |                         30 |      11 |       24 |       48 |       48 |       48 |       48 |       48 |       96 |       96 |       96 |       96 |       96 |       96 |        96 |

Enough/Not Enough Mitigation

The Enough/Not enough function is enabled with the

enableEnoughNotEnoughIndication struct member of the

RimRSGlobal.sequenceDomainPara attribute. The function uses

different RIM-RS type 1 sequences to indicate whether the applied mitigation method

successfully resolved the remote interference or not. The Enough/Not enough function

indication increases signal transmission periodicity.

The victim cell on the gNodeB transmits RIM-RS type 1 with the Not

enough indication if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The function is enabled
- Remote interference is experienced

The victim cell on the gNodeB transmits RIM-RS type 1 with the Enough

indication if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The function is enabled
- Remote interference is reduced to acceptable levels
- RIM-RS type 2 transmission is received

Near-Far

The near-far function enables the detection of different propagation delay ranges.

The following cases are possible:

- For near RIM-RS type 1 transmissions, the transmission happens in the last two downlink symbols of the special slot.
- For far RIM-RS type 1 transmissions, the transmission happens in the last two downlink symbols of the downlink slot that is two slots before the special slot.

Repetition

Repetition is the number of possible repetitions for the RS sequence in the time

domain. The repetition function improves the performance of RIM-RS type 1 and RIM-RS

type 2 detection.

The repetition function can be configured through the

nrofConsecutiveRIMRS1 and

nrofConsecutiveRIMRS2 struct members of the

RimRSGlobal.TimeDomainPara attribute. The number of

repetitions depends on the following settings:

- The value set for the nrofConsecutiveRIMRS1 and nrofConsecutiveRIMRS2 struct members of the RimRSGlobal.TimeDomainPara attribute
- Whether the Near-Far function is enabled or disabled

RIM-RS Transmission Period

The transmission period of RIM-RS is affected by the following components:

- The value set for the following struct members: The totalnrofSetIdofRS1 struct member of the RimRSGlobal.TimeDomainPara attribute The totalnrofSetIdofRS2 struct member of the RimRSGlobal.TimeDomainPara attribute
- Whether the following conditions are met: Enough/Not-Enough indication function is enabled Near-Far function is enabled The value of the nrofConsecutiveRIMRS1 and nrofConsecutiveRIMRS2 struct members of the RimRSGlobal.TimeDomainPara attribute is set to two
- Whether there are one or two concatenated TDD patterns in the uplink-downlink switching period

Depending on the values set and functions enabled, the transmission period might

increase. Table 3 shows an example of how

the transmission period increases when the following figures are given:

- The SET-ID is 19 bit
- Two frequency positions
- The total SET-ID is 524288

The total number of transmission periods in one minute is the sum of the following

variables:

- Transmission periods in 1 minute with RIM-RS type 1 only
- Transmission periods in 1 minute with both RIM-RS type 1 and RIM-RS type 2

SET-ID

The gNodeBs involved in a remote interference situation can be grouped into sets,

with a unique SET-ID assigned on cell or gNodeB level. The grouping of gNodeBs into

sets is performed by the OAM in frequency, time, and sequence domains. For example,

with two frequency positions, all SET-IDS can be grouped into two groups.

The maximum number of bits in a SET-ID is 22. For more information, see 3GPP TS

38.211; NR; Physical Channels and Modulation, Release 18.

Figure 2 shows an example for a SET-ID with

19 bits.

Figure 2   SET-ID with 19 Bits

Cells in each frequency group require the RS transmission to be configured in a

different frequency position. The set range for 19-bit SET-IDs in each frequency

position is shown in the table below.

Table 4   Set Range for 19-Bit SET-ID

| Frequency Positions   | Set Range       | SET-ID (19 Bits)   |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| F0                    | F0 SET-ID Range | 0–262143           |
| F1                    | F1 SET-ID Range | 262144–524287      |

The SET-ID must be allocated appropriately for each node to ensure optimal

performance.

The number of frequency positions configured equals the number of SET-ID ranges. For

more information on calculating the SET-ID ranges, see 3GPP TS 38.211; NR;

Physical Channels and Modulation, Release 18, 7.4.1.6.4.5.

## 3.1 Remote Interference Location

The feature locates interference in remote cells by using RIM-RS type 1 and uses

RIM-RS type 2 to disable the function, working based on NR RIM-Location

Framework-1.

When remote interference is detected, the remote interference location function helps to

identify the location of the remote interference by using RIM-RS type 1 transmitted and

received by the gNodeBs. The quantity of uplink symbols affected by remote interference

in the victim cell can also be determined.

When remote interference is no longer detected, although the aggressor cell gNodeB keeps

transmitting RIM-RS type 2 transmissions, the victim cell gNodeB no longer receives it.

This is because the ducting no longer exists.

Figure 3   Determination of Remote Interference Location

The remote interference location is determined according to the following process:

1. Remote interference is detected. Note: The Remote Interference Detection feature must be enabled to observe and monitor the interference slope and the interference level.
2. The gNodeB of the victim cell starts transmitting RIM-RS type 1 if the following conditions are true: The NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState attribute is true. The NRCellDU.rimHighIpnState attribute is true. RIM-RS type 1 transmissions indicate Not enough when the enoughNotEnoughIndication struct member of the RimRSGlobal.sequenceDomainPara attribute is set ENABLED. When remote interference is no longer detected and a RIM-RS type 2 transmission is received from the gNodeB, the RIM-RS type 1 transmissions indicate Enough.
3. The gNodeB of the aggressor cell receives the RIM-RS type 1 transmission.
4. The gNodeB of the aggressor cell continues to monitor RIM-RS type 1 transmissions to determine when to apply downlink mitigation and to transmit RIM-RS type 2.
5. The gNodeB of the victim cell monitors RIM-RS type 2 transmissions to determine when to stop the procedure of the remote interference location function and the applied mitigation methods.

RIM-RS type 1 is transmitted in the last two downlink symbols in the special slot or the

last two symbols of the second downlink slot before the special slot, as described in

Near-Far. The gNodeB of the victim cell

stops transmitting RIM-RS type 1 if the following conditions are met:

- No slope is detected
- No RIM-RS type 2 transmission is received

The information contained in the received RIM-RS type 1 transmission can trigger the

transmission of RIM-RS type 2.

The gNodeB of the aggressor cell stops the transmission of RIM-RS type 2 if no RIM-RS

type 1 transmission is received.

The remote interference location and the remote interference-triggered offload functions

must not be enabled at the same time. This way, the remote interference location

function can control the remote interference-triggered offload function.

Near-Far

The near-far function enables the detection of different propagation delay ranges.

The following cases are possible:

- For near RIM-RS type 1 transmissions, the transmission happens in the last two downlink symbols of the special slot.
- For far RIM-RS type 1 transmissions, the transmission happens in the last two downlink symbols of the downlink slot that is two slots before the special slot.

NR Remote Interference Detection

## 3.2 Interference Mitigation Scheme

Interference in the remote cells can be mitigated in the downlink as well as in the

uplink.

Depending on whether the cell is the aggressor or the victim, the gNodeB can apply

specific mitigation methods in the downlink and the uplink. When the remote interference

location function is enabled, monitoring the RIM-RS transmissions helps the gNodeB to

determine when to enable or disable the applied mitigation methods.

### 3.2.1 Downlink Mitigation

At the end of RIM-RS type 1 transmission period, the resource signal power is calculated

for each propagation delay interval in the uplink. The gNodeB of the aggressor cell uses

this information to trigger the appropriate mitigation in the downlink.

The aggressor cell can trigger the following mitigation functions in the downlink:

- PDSCH slot-based blanking
- Remote interference downlink power control
- Symbol-based blanking

#### 3.2.1.1 PDSCH Slot-Based Blanking

The feature can mitigate interference in the victim cell by applying PDSCH slot-based

blanking in the aggressor cell.

Applying downlink blanking on the aggressor cell might reduce remote interference on the

uplink symbols of the victim cells. After detecting RIM-RS type 1 transmissions, the

aggressor performs one of the following actions when the

NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute is set to a value other

than DISABLED:

- Blanking of the PDSCH special slot
- Blanking of the PDSCH special slot and the first downlink slot before the special slot
- Blanking of the PDSCH special slot and the two downlink slots before the special slot

Figure 4   Example of PDSCH Slot-Based Blanking

The PDSCH slot-based blanking function can be applied automatically or manually.

Automatic Blanking Mode

The following conditions must be fulfilled to trigger downlink slot blanking

automatically:

- The NRCellDU.rimDetectionEnabled attribute must be set to true to enable the NR Remote Interference Detection feature.
- The value of the NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute must be set to AUTO\_RS1.Note: The value of the NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute can be set to AUTO\_RS1 only when the value of the NRCellDU.rimLocationEnabled attribute is set to true.
- The value of the NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState attribute must be true.

If the conditions are met, the following cases are possible:

- Based on the RIM-RS power of the first DMRS symbol in the first uplink slot, the gNodeB automatically triggers PDSCH special slot blanking. The ratio of valid far RIM-RS type 1 transmissions must be equal to or less than the value set for the NRCellDU.rimRS1FarThresh attribute.
- Based on the RIM-RS power of the last DMRS symbol in the first uplink slot, the gNodeB automatically triggers the blanking of the PDSCH special slot and the first downlink slot before the special slot. The ratio of valid far RIM-RS type 1 transmissions must be equal to or less than the value set for the NRCellDU.rimRS1FarThresh attribute.
- Based on the RIM-RS power of the last DMRS symbol in the first uplink slot, the gNodeB automatically triggers the blanking of the PDSCH special slot, the first downlink slot before the special slot, and the second downlink slot before the special slot. The ratio of valid far RIM-RS type 1 transmissions must be equal to or greater than the value set for the NRCellDU.rimRS1FarThresh attribute.

The gNodeB stops downlink slot blanking if the following requirements are

met:

- The remote interference is no longer detected.
- The threshold defined by the value set for the NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankStopThresh is met.
- No RIM-RS type 2 transmission is received when the aggressor cell is also a victim cell.

A timer is used to prevent the function from repeatedly getting activated and

deactivated. The duration of this timer can be configured with the

NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankTimer attribute. The timer operates

in the following way:

- The timer starts when the conditions to trigger downlink slot blanking are fulfilled at the end of a remote interference detection period.
- The timer restarts as long as the conditions are fulfilled.
- The timer stops when performing a fallback to non-blanking state in automatic mode, or when the value of the NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute is set to one of the following values: SPECIAL\_SLOT SPECIAL\_DL\_SLOT SPECIAL\_DL\_DL\_SLOT

Manual Blanking Mode

For manual blanking mode, the remote interference location function must be enabled

with the NRCellDU.rimLocationEnabled attribute. The downlink slot

blanking mode is set by configuring the value of the

NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute to one of the

following values:

- SPECIAL\_SLOT
- SPECIAL\_DL\_SLOT
- SPECIAL\_DL\_DL\_SLOT

When blanking is configured by the operator manually, the timer for downlink slot

blanking does not start. Downlink slot blanking stops when the

NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute is set to a value

other than the following values:

- SPECIAL\_SLOT
- SPECIAL\_DL\_SLOT
- SPECIAL\_DL\_DL\_SLOT

##### 3.2.1.1.1 Remote Interference Downlink Power Control

The remote interference downlink power control function is used in combination with the

PDSCH slot-based blanking function.

To reduce the loss in downlink capacity caused by blanking the PDSCH transmissions, the

remote interference downlink power control function allows the reduction of the downlink

power instead of blanking the downlink slots in aggressor cells.

The following slot blanking patterns exist when using power control in combination with

slot blanking:

- Blanking the PDSCH special slot and using power control in the first downlink slot before the special slot
- Blanking the PDSCH special slot and the first downlink slot before the special slot and using power control in the second downlink slot before the special slot

Figure 5   Example of Downlink Slot Blanking Patterns

Figure 6   Process of Choosing Appropriate Mitigation Method in the Downlink

The chosen mitigation method depends on the following conditions:

- The propagation delay range
- The distance between the aggressor cell and the victim cell expressed in symbols
- Whether the PRB utilization is larger or smaller than the threshold

#### 3.2.1.2 Symbol-Based Blanking

The function enables the blanking of the downlink symbols that cause the

interference.

The gNodeB of the aggressor cell can blank the symbols in the first downlink slot before

the special slot in cases where the DDDSU DDSUU TDD pattern is used. After the gNodeB

calculates the number of downlink symbols that cause the interference, the gNodeB

triggers the blanking of these downlink symbols.

Figure 7   Example of Symbol Blanking

### 3.2.2 Uplink Mitigation

The uplink mitigation methods activate and deactivate depending on the slope detection

data and the RIM-RS type 2 status. The applied mitigation method depends on the average

IpN threshold. The following cases are possible:

- If the NRCellDU.rimCLPCHighIpnRSThresh attribute value is met, uplink closed-loop power control is applied in Low-Band.
- If the NRCellDU.riOffloadHighIpnRSThresh attribute value is met, the Remote Interference-Triggered Offload function is triggered.

When no slope or RIM-RS type 2 is detected, the uplink mitigation is stopped.

#### 3.2.2.1 Uplink Closed-Loop Power Control

Applying uplink closed-loop power control in Mid-Band can reduce the PUSCH

performance degradation caused by remote interference.

When the remote interference location function is enabled, the function triggers uplink

closed-loop power control when the following criteria are fulfilled:

- The NR Remote Interference Detection feature is enabled.
- The NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled.
- The value of either of the following attributes is set to true: NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState NRCellDU.rimDetectedRS1State
- The value set for the NRCellDU.rimCLPCHighIpnRSThresh attribute is met or exceeded.

Uplink closed-loop power control is applied to mitigate the effects of remote

interference. The uplink received power target of the UEs in non-power limited cases is

increased, which reduces the PUSCH performance degradation caused by remote

interference.

For more information, see NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band.

#### 3.2.2.2 Remote Interference-Triggered Offload

When a cell is affected by remote interference, the feature offloads UEs with poor

uplink quality to an NR FDD or LTE FDD carrier and blocks the incoming mobility of cell-edge

UEs.

The remote interference-triggered offload function can be used when other interference

mitigation methods cannot sufficiently reduce interference levels in the victim

cells.

When the function is enabled, the UEs with poor uplink quality can be offloaded with

blind RwR to an NR FDD or LTE FDD carrier from the victim cell. The gNodeB also blocks

incoming idle and connected mode mobility of cell-edge UEs to the victim cell. FWA UEs

are released because there are no NR FDD cells or LTE cells to be relocated to. It is

recommended to set the RimOffloadUeCfg.rimUlCriticalQualThresh

attribute to the lowest supported value for the FWA UE group to delay the release of the

FWA UEs from the current TDD cell.

Figure 8   Selecting an Offload Carrier

UE offload is performed according to the following process:

1. The average interference levels are monitored for each remote interference detection period.
2. The gNodeB starts the offload process if the following requirements are fulfilled: The NRCellDU.rimOffloadEnabled attribute is set to true. The average interference that is detected exceeds the value set for the NRCellDU.rimOffloadHighIpNThresh attribute. Note: The offload-triggering threshold can also be configured at UE group level.
3. An NR offload carrier is selected for RwR if the following requirements are fulfilled: The value of the OffloadNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rimOffloadType attribute is set to BLIND\_RWR. The UE supports the NR frequency band. If the UE is a RedCap UE, the target frequency selected for RwR is the frequency with the lowest ARFCN that supports RedCap UEs. If no such frequency is available, the target LTE frequency is selected based on legacy handling.
4. An LTE offload carrier is selected for RwR if the following requirements are fulfilled: An NR offload frequency is not configured. An NR offload frequency is configured but the UE does not support the NR frequency band. The value of the OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rimOffloadType attribute is set to BLIND\_RWR. The UE supports the LTE frequency band.
5. If there is a suitable offload carrier, the UEs with poor uplink quality are offloaded with blind RwR to the carrier.
6. If there is no suitable offload carrier configured, the UE is released to idle mode.Note: As the gNodeB blocks incoming mobility to the cell, the UE is prevented from reselecting the victim cell.

When the victim gNodeB starts the offload, it also starts blocking incoming idle and

connected mode mobility for cell edge UEs to the cell affected by interference,

according to the following methodology:

- For incoming idle mode mobility, the minimum RSRP level for selecting the cell is defined by the q-RxLevMin value broadcasted in SIB1. The q-RxLevMin value during normal conditions is the value of the NRCellDU.qRxLevMin attribute. When the offload is ongoing, the q-RxLevMin value is increased proportionally to the added interference to block UEs who would get poor uplink quality from selecting the cell. In this case, the q-RxLevMin value is the sum of the following attributes and calculations: NRCellDU.qRxLevMin NRCellDU.rimQRxLevMinConstant NRCellDU.rimQRxLevMinIpNCompFactor additional interference calculated by the gNodeB
- For incoming connected mode mobility, the victim gNodeB accepts or blocks an incoming handover request based on the target cell RSRP value provided in the handover request received from the other eNodeB or gNodeB. The following cases are possible: If the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rimOffloadIncHoRsrpThresh attribute is empty, the same RSRP threshold is used for both connected and idle mode mobility. This means that the q-RxLevMin value broadcasted in SIB1 is the required minimum received RSRP level for the handover request to be accepted. If the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rimOffloadIncHoRsrpThresh attribute is non-empty, the value configured for the attribute is the required minimum received RSRP level for the handover request to be accepted. This means that the RSRP threshold for connected mode mobility is configured separately from that for idle mobility.

When the interference stops, the gNodeB stops offloading the UEs and blocking incoming

mobility to the cell.

The remote interference location and the remote interference-triggered offload functions

must not be enabled at the same time. This allows the remote interference location

function to control the remote interference-triggered offload function.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Remote Interference Management

The feature improves the network performance by mitigating remote

interference.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves uplink throughput and reduces interference in remote cells.

During the operation of the remote interference-triggered offload function, the

following network impact is expected:

- Improved throughput for UEs that are offloaded from the victim cell to an NR FDD or LTE FDD cell
- Improved throughput for UEs that are blocked from connecting to the victim cell
- RLF risk decrease
- Increased load on the target NR FDD and LTE FDD carriers during offloading
- Decrease in the mobility KPIs of the target NR FDD and LTE FDD carriers during the offloading process

The remote interference downlink power control function reduces the loss in downlink

capacity caused by blanking the downlink slots in aggressor cells, while still

allowing the mitigation of remote interference in the victim cell.

The remote interference downlink power control function also allows power control in

a slot that has no downlink mitigation if the function is not enabled.

Interfaces

The remote interference-triggered offload function affects the Xn and NG interfaces.

The target cell RSRP measurement, which provided in the

HandoverPreparationInformation RRC message, is used for blocking

NR handovers that target the victim cell during offloading.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of NR Remote Interference Management

The feature behavior can be affected and controlled by various

parameters.

To enable a function, additional steps or the configuration of attributes might be

required.

### 7.1.1 Enable Remote Interference Location Function

Enabling the remote interference location function requires additional

steps.

Prerequisites

The NR Remote Interference Management license is

activated.

Steps

1. Enable the NR Remote Interference Detection feature by setting the NRCellDU.rimDetectionEnabled attribute to true.
2. Set the NRCellDU.rimLocationEnabled attribute to true. The Remote Interference Location and the Remote Interference-Triggered Offload functions must not be enabled at the same time. This way, the Remote Interference Location function can control the Remote Interference-Triggered Offload function. The remote interference-triggered offload function can be used as a standalone function by disabling Remote Interference Location and enabling the Remote Interference-Triggered Offload function. Note: The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm is raised with the "NR Remote Interference Management feature is not supported by equipment associated with MO in Additional Information." additional text when the NR Remote Interference Management feature is configured and the Remote Interference Location function is enabled for a radio that does not support the function.

### 7.1.2 Enable PDSCH Slot-Based Blanking Automatic Mode

Performing downlink slot blanking automatically requires additional

steps.

Prerequisites

The NR Remote Interference Management license is activated.

Steps

1. Set the value of the NRCellDU.rimDetectionEnabled attribute to true.
2. Set the value of the NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode attribute to AUTO\_RS1.

### 7.1.3 Enable Remote Interference-Triggered Offload Function

Enabling remote interference-triggered offload requires additional steps.

Prerequisites

The NR Remote Interference Management license is activated.

Steps

1. Enable the NR Remote Interference Detection feature by setting the NRCellDU.rimDetectionEnabled attribute to true.
2. Set the NRCellDU.rimOffloadEnabled attribute to true.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Remote Interference Management

## 9.1 Radio-Dependent PRB Range Configurations

Additional configurations are required for the AIR 6454, AIR 6488, and AIR 3239

radios.

For AIR 6454, AIR 6488, and AIR 3239 radios, RIM-RSs must be fully contained in only one

allowed PRB range, for each radio and carrier bandwidth, to prevent communication

issues. The allowed PRB range is defined by the

rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList struct member of the

RimRSGlobal.frequencyDomainPara attribute.

For the specific PRB ranges of the specific bandwidths, see the following tables:

- AIR 3239
- AIR 6454
- Split mode AIR 6488
- Non-split mode AIR 6488

For AIR 6488, the selected antenna segmentation is communicated to the operator in the

AasData.usedAntSegmentation attribute if the

NRSectorCarrier and EUtranCellTDD MO classes

from all RATs that share the same radio units are unlocked.

If the AasData MO class does not exist, the operator must create the

MO class.

If the value of the AasData.antSegmentation attribute is set to

AUTO, segmentation data is not received.

## 9.2 Partially Overlapping Spectrum and Mapping

Partial spectrum overlaps and mapping in the time domain might need to be considered

to ensure that the feature works as intended.

RIM-RS Detection in Case of Partially Overlapping Spectrum

When frequency bands overlap partially, the RIM-RS might not be detected without a

frequency reference point, therefore, having a common reference point becomes more

important. Transmission and detection of RIM-RS type 1 is not possible outside of

the overlapping portions. If the spectrums of multiple carriers partially overlap,

the global RIM-RS PRBs can only be allocated within the overlapped spectrum, as

shown in Figure 9.

The common carrier reference point is defined by the

rimRSCommonCarrierRefPoint struct member of the

RimRSGlobal.frequencyDomainPara attribute.

The values of the following attributes affect the result:

- NRCellDU.subCarrierSpacing
- NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL(PRB)
- NRSectorCarrier.frequencyUL

The first PRB at subcarrier 0 can be calculated using the following calculation:

PRB 0 = NRSectorCarrier.frequencyUL -

(NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL[PRB] × 12 × NRCellDU.subCarrierSpacing) /

2

The following values affect the starting subcarrier offset:

- The reference point, which is expressed as F0 in the calculation. The reference point is defined by the rimRSCommonCarrierRefPoint struct member of the RimRSGlobal.frequencyDomainPara attribute. The struct member can be configured according to the needs of the operator. The unit is given as Hz.
- K1, which is the number of PRBs between the reference point and the starting point of the RIM-RS type 1 transmission. The value is determined by the SET-ID value listed in the rimRSStartingFrequencyOffsetIdList struct member of the RimRSGlobal.frequencyDomainPara attribute, at the given frequency index. The struct member can be configured according to the needs of the operator. The unit is given as PRB.
- The first PRB at subcarrier 0. The unit is given as Hz.
- Sub-carrier spacing. The unit is given as Hz.
- 12, which is the number of subcarriers in each PRB.

The starting sub-carrier offset can be calculated using the following

calculation:

starting subcarrier offset = (F0 + K1 × 12 × sub-carrier spacing -

first PRB at sub-carrier 0) / subcarrier spacing

It is recommended to start at PRB 51 to avoid collisions with other channels and

signals. This means that the starting PRB of the second carrier is the sum of the

PRBs in the first carrier plus 51 PRBs.

Figure 9   Transmission in Relation to Reference Point

Figure 10   Bandwidth and Central Frequency Comparison

Figure 11   Subcarrier Misalignment

If subcarriers are misaligned, the RIM feature cannot be used. In such cases,

one of the carriers has to be shifted.

Frequency Offset Configuration for Multiple Sector Carriers

The GNBDUFunction.setIdAllocation attribute must be set to

CELL when there are multiple sector carriers in a gNodeB. The

cells must not have overlapping bandwidths.

To prevent issues regarding overlapping bandwidths, different frequency positions

must be configured using the rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList struct

member of the RimRSGlobal.frequencyDomainPara attribute. One

frequency position must be configured within the bandwidth of each of the sector

carriers. Table 11 describes the supported

configurations depending on the number of the sector carriers in one gNodeB.

Carriers

Mapping the gNodeB in the Time Domain

The value set for the repetition affects the transmission of near and far-type RIM-RS

transmission. For example, if the repetition is set to 2, the first

uplink-downlink switching period contains the near transmissions and the second

switching period contains the far transmissions. The same gNodeB SET-ID is mapped to

both of these switching periods.

The SET-ID must be allocated appropriately for each node to ensure optimal

performance.

The number of frequency positions configured equals the number of SET-ID ranges. For

more information on calculating the SET-ID ranges, see 3GPP TS 38.211; NR;

Physical Channels and Modulation, Release 18, 7.4.1.6.4.5.

Table 12 shows an example of how the ranges

are divided when the number of bits in SET-ID is 19 and two frequency positions are

configured.

Table 12   Example of SET-ID Ranges with Two Frequency Positions

| SET-ID Range   | Value         |
|----------------|---------------|
| First range    | 0–262143      |
| Second range   | 262144–524287 |

Table 13   Example of SET-ID Ranges with Four Frequency Positions

| SET-ID Range   | Value         |
|----------------|---------------|
| First range    | 0–131071      |
| Second range   | 131072–262143 |
| Third range    | 262144–393215 |
| Fourth range   | 393216–524287 |

Figure 12 shows an example of correctly and

incorrectly configured frequency positions in case of two sector carriers in one

gNodeB.

Figure 12   Example of Correct and Incorrect Frequency Position Configuration

No frequency overlap occurs when multiple gNodeBs are configured with two

non-overlapping cells, but each cell overlaps with a cell in another gNodeB. In this

case, a RimRSGlobal MO instance is used and cell-level SET-ID

configuration is required. A cell cannot have a SET-ID that points to a frequency

position outside of the bandwidth, and nodes are configured with two different

non-overlapping frequencies. Therefore, the cells in each frequency must be

configured with a different range of SET-ID.

non-overlapping frequency positions.

Full frequency position overlap occurs when multiple gNodeBs are configured, but one

cell overlaps with a cell in another gNodeB. In this case, a

RimRSGlobal MO instance is used.

Partial frequency position overlap occurs when multiple gNodeBs are configured, but a

cell overlaps with a cell within the same gNodeB. In this case, a

RimRSGlobal MO instance is used. If there is a partial

frequency position overlap, a frequency position must be configured that is

positioned in the overlapping spectrum between the two cells. The SET-ID must be

chosen to ensure that RIM-RS is transmitted in the common frequency position.

Anticipated RIM-RS False Detection Rate

The average number of anticipated false detections within an RS transmission period

can differ based on the global RIM-RS configuration.

The average number means that some periods can have more false detections, but some

other periods can have less. Not having the exact number of expected false

detections for each period is normal.

For example, if the values of the nrofConsecutiveRIMRS1 and

nrofConsecutiveRIMRS2 struct members are set to

2 while Near-Far function and Enough/Not-Enough function are

enabled, the RIM-RS type 1 period results are doubled. Using the default value of

10 for the

NRCellDU.rimRSDetectionThresholdOffset attribute results in

an average of four false detections during one RS transmission period for RIM-RS

type 1.

within an RS transmission period.

False detections are random and so they can occur in any of the following

contexts:

- Frequency
- Sequence
- SFN
- Slot
- Symbol

False detections can be confirmed in the following ways:

- SET-ID repetition in RS transmission period For a valid SET-ID, SET-IDs must be repeated in a successive RS transmission period. A changing SET-ID between each RIM-RS transmission period indicates a false detection.
- Unknown SET-ID The DuPerRimMeasurementReport PM event displays detailed information about detected RIM-RS type 1, including the SET-ID of the victim cells that are detected by the aggressor cells. The detected SET-ID can be verified to check if the SET-ID is mapped to any cell. The detected SET-ID can also be mapped to a gNodeB-ID and checked.
- Symbol index The detected symbol index information of the detected RIM RS type 1 can be checked through the DuPerRimMeasurementReport PM event. The symbol index information depends on the propagation delay between the victim cell and the aggressor cell, and is related to the physical distance between the two cells. If atmospheric ducts are present, the RIM-RS type 1 signal from the victim cell can reach the aggressor cell at a symbol in the uplink slot or special slot, depending on the physical distance between the cells. The information is used to verify whether the symbol index position and the actual physical position match.Note: The distance calculated from the detected symbol index and the actual physical distance calculated might differ because of the atmospheric duct.

## 10.1 23.Q3: NR PDSCH Slot-Based Blanking

When atmospheric ducting causes interference in remote cells, the interference can

be mitigated at the aggressor cell using PDSCH slot-based blanking.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces an interference mitigation method that targets the

aggressor cell. Performing downlink blanking on the aggressor cell can reduce the

remote interference on the uplink symbols of the victim cells. The following

configurations are possible:

- Blanking the PDSCH special slot
- Blanking the PDSCH special slot and the first downlink slot before the special slot.

The following operation modes are available:

| Automatic   |    | The gNodeB automatically enables downlink slot blanking when remote                                 interference is detected. When the remote interference stops, the                                 downlink slot blanking is disabled. This mode can be used if                                 symmetric interference is assumed, which means that the cell                                 affected by remote interference also causes interference in other                                 remote cells as aggressor cells.   |
|-------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Manual      |    | Downlink slot blanking can be enabled in a cell through the MOM. This                                 mode can be used in case of both symmetric and asymmetric                                 interference. In case of asymmetric remote interference, the                                 aggressor cell is not a victim cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

To identify the PDSCH slot or slots targeted for blanking, symbol-level interference

measurement support is required.

The feature enhancement supports Mid-Band EN-DC and NR SA deployments. Only specific

TDD patterns are supported.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved uplink throughput
- Reduced abnormal release rate
- Improved RACH success rate
- Reduced uplink interference in remote cells

Capacity and Performance

The following counters can be used to observe the impact of slot-based blanking on

PDSCH resources:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUtilDlDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUtilDlMax
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlots

The following KPIs can be used to observe the performance of the feature

enhancement:

- Normalized UL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PUSCH slot only
- Average UL MAC UE Throughput
- Random Access Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability considering EN-DC connectivity, Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankMode
- NRCellDU.rimPdschSlotBlankTimer

The feature enhancement supports only the following TDD patterns:

- 4 downlink + 2 uplink + 4 downlink CSI-RS blanking is not supported in this pattern if CSI-RS is configured in the blanked PDSCH slot.
- 8 downlink + 2 uplink

The value of the NRCellDU.rimDetectionEnabled attribute must

be set to true to allow symbol-level interference measurement and

automatic PDSCH slot blanking.

Hardware

The feature enhancement only supports Baseband hardware types that belong to either

RAN Compute group 4 or RAN Compute group 5.

Interfaces

NR Remote Interference Management

## 10.2 23.Q3: Remote Interference-Triggered Offload

When a cell is affected by remote interference, the feature enhancement offloads UEs

with poor uplink quality to an NR FDD or LTE FDD carrier and blocks the incoming mobility of

cell-edge UEs.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces a UE offloading function to mitigate the effects

of remote interference on NR TDD victim cells. When a cell experiences remote

interference, the uplink throughput of the UE can be affected. With this feature

enhancement, if the gNodeB detects a high level of uplink interference in a TDD

cell, UEs with poor uplink quality can be offloaded with blind RwR to another NR FDD

or LTE FDD carrier. Moreover, the gNodeB blocks incoming idle and connected mode

mobility of cell-edge UEs to the victim cell for the duration of the remote

interference.

This feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Improved throughput for the UEs that are offloaded from the victim TDD cell to an FDD cell.
- The UEs blocked from connecting to the victim cell might have better throughput in an alternative cell with better radio conditions.
- Offloading UEs decreases the risk of RLF.

This feature enhancement is only supported in NR Standalone deployment and NR

Mid-Band TDD cells.

Capacity and Performance

The DuProcUeContextRelease PM event provides observability for

the retainability improvement.

When UEs are offloaded to an NR FDD or LTE FDD carrier from the victim cell, the load

on these carriers might increase.

Mobility KPIs in neighbor nodes might decrease during offloading, because the gNodeB

blocks incoming handover for cell-edge UEs.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following MO classes and their attributes:

- RimOffload
- RimOffloadUeCfg
- TrafficOffload OffloadNrFreqRelProfile OffloadNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfile OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg

- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepFailInInterGnbRi

For the same purpose, the feature enhancement introduces the following EBS

counters:

- pmEbsHoPrepFailInEutranRi
- pmEbsHoPrepFailInInterGnbRi

The EBS counters introduced by this feature enhancement are associated with the

NRCellCU MO. For more information on the EBS counters

associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The feature enhancement supports UE grouping for the offloading uplink quality

threshold and the offload carrier configuration.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the Xn and NG interfaces. The target cell RSRP

measurement, which is provided in the HandoverPreparationInformation

RRC message, is used for blocking NR handovers that target the victim cell during

offloading.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

| Impact at Upgrade:      | Optional                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables the configuration of the minimum required RSRP value

with which the threshold for incoming handover can be handled separately from the

cell reselection threshold. Based on the configured value, the gNodeB accepts or

denies the incoming handover request of a UE when the Remote Interference-Triggered

Offload function is enabled and the mitigation is ongoing.

Capacity and Performance

The following PM counters can be used to observe the number of incoming handovers

that failed because of remote interference:

- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepFailInEutranRi
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepFailInInterGnbRi

For the same purpose, the following EBS counters can be used:

- pmEbsHoPrepFailInEutranRi
- pmEbsHoPrepFailInInterGnbRi

The EBS counters are associated with the NRCellCU MO. For more

information on the EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and

Delta Lists.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rimOffloadIncHoRsrpThresh attribute.

The value serves as the threshold requirement for incoming handover.

The RSRP threshold depends on the configuration of the UE configured group type that

the NRCellCU.offloadCellProfileRef refers to.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces the use of RIM reference signal type 1 and RIM

reference signal type 2. With this enhancement, the NR Remote Interference

Management feature can locate the interference in remote cells. The applied

mitigation actions can also be more efficient.

The transmission of reference signals also enables the following actions:

- Detection of different propagation delay ranges
- Indication of successful mitigation between the gNodeB of the victim cell and the aggressor cell
- Configuration of the number of possible repetitions for the reference signal sequence in the time domain

The feature enhancement also improves mitigation in the downlink by enabling

symbol-level blanking and downlink power control. In the uplink, when the NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band feature is

active, closed-loop power control can also be triggered. The remote

interference-triggered offload function can also mitigate interference in the

uplink.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Reduces the interference in remote cells caused by atmospheric ducting
- Decreased KPI degradation in victim cells
- Reduces the loss in downlink capacity caused by blanking the PDSCH transmissions

The feature enhancement is supported for NR standalone and EN-DC deployments.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement improves uplink throughput and reduces interference in remote

cells.

The feature enhancement introduces the DuPerRimMeasurementReport PM event, which

provides observability for the detected RIM reference signal type 1 and RIM

reference signal type 2 sequence information for each RIM reference signal type 1

report interval.

The feature enhancement affects the following alarms:

- The Inconsistent Configuration alarm is updated with the following additional texts: MO::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList inconsistent with MO::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSBandwidth.The MO is listed in Additional Information. MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList inconsistent with one or more of MO2::ulAvailableCrbs, MO2::ulStartCrb, MO2::dlAvailableCrbs, MO2::dlStartCrb, MO3::bSChannelBwUL, MO3::bSChannelBwDL.The MOs are listed in Additional Information. MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList inconsistent with one or more of MO2::dlAvailableCrbs, MO2::dlStartCrb, MO3::bSChannelBwDL.The MOs are listed in Additional Information. One or more of MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList, MO2::setId, MO3::setId inconsistent with one or more of MO4::dlAvailableCrbs, MO4::dlStartCrb, MO5::bSChannelBwDL.The MOs are listed in Additional Information. One or more of MO::timeDomainPara.nrofConsecutiveRIMRS1, MO::timeDomainPara.nrofConsecutiveRIMRS2 inconsistent with Paging.The MO is listed in Additional Information.
- The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm is updated with the following additional texts: NR Remote Interference Management feature is not supported by equipment associated with MO in Additional Information. One or more of MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList, MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSBandwidth not supported for equipment represented by MO2. The MOs are listed in Additional Information. MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList not supported for equipment represented by MO2. The MOs are listed in Additional Information. One or more of MO1::frequencyDomainPara.rimRSStartingFreqOffsetIdList, MO2::setId, MO3::setId not supported for equipment represented by MO4. The MOs are listed in Additional Information.
- The MO Configuration Pending Action alarm is updated with the Restart node. additional text. Note: The feature is restricted due to upcoming First Field Implementation.
