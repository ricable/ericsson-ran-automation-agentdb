Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the configuration of CRP for idle mode mobility for

selected groups of UEs. Both LTE and NR frequencies can be configured for

reselection.

The feature enhancement allows control over idle mode mobility. Selected groups of

UEs can be configured to move to specific frequencies when the UE goes to idle mode,

which provides UE-specific behavior.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

With the feature enhancement, specific CRPs can be assigned to specific groups of

UEs.

The following attributes are introduced to designate LTE or NR frequency priority for

reselection:

- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.freqPrioListEUtran
- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.freqPrioListNR

If the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.actionAtRelease attribute is set to

PRIORITY\_LIST, the selected frequencies in the

TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.freqPrioListEUtran attribute or

TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.freqPrioListNR attribute are sent to

the UE in the RRCRelease message.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the

EBS counters introduced by this feature enhancement.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows the User- and Service Specific Mobility feature to

support NR SA, EN-DC and NR-DC deployments by adding UE group support for the

following

mobility

functions:

- Intra-frequency Mobility Control for EN-DC
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage for EN-DC
- PSCell Change to Higher Priority for EN-DC
- Intra-frequency Intra-gNB PSCell Change for NR-DC

This feature enhancement also introduces UE group support for the following mobility

features:

- NR DL Carrier Aggregation SCell mobility for NR SA and EN-DC
- Fallback Handling at Session Setup

This feature enhancement expands the support for separate configuration of different

UE groups for mobility features including EN-DC and NR-DC deployment. This makes it

possible to operate NR RAN with optimized mobility configuration for individual UE

groups.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

For each of the supported mobility features, the configuration data is read from the

corresponding UeCfg MO

instance

that matches the MO instance of the UE group that the UE belongs

to.

The UE group support is controlled through the User- and Service-Specific Mobility

feature. If the User- and Service-Specific Mobility feature is not configured, the

Base

instance of the

UeCfg

MO class is used.
