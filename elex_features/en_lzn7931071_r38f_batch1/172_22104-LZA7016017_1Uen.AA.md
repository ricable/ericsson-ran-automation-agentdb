Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

UE group changes are only handled in NR standalone and in NR-DC MCGs.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation

The User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation feature enables differentiated

carrier aggregation configuration for different groups of UEs.

The activation of the User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation feature license

enables the differentiated configuration of carrier aggregation-related attributes.

# 7 Activate User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012663 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012663 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
