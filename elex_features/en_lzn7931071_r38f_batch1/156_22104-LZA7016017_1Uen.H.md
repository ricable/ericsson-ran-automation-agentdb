# 1 NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission Overview

This feature can automatically adjust the RLC poll interval based on the number of poll

retransmissions.

Summary

The NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission Overview feature improves bearer retainability

for gNodeBs in high load scenarios and for UEs in poor radio conditions. With the

feature active, the poll interval is dynamically increased and optimized for the

configured number of poll retransmissions. The feature reduces unnecessary poll

retransmissions and extends the time to declare RLF in the downlink without

impacting the poll behavior for other UEs.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission

The

feature

uses parameters from the

DrbRlcUeCfg

and

the SignalingRadioBearer MO classes as

input.

The feature is applicable to both NSA and SA. In the SA case, the feature works on both

DRBs and SRBs. In the NSA case, the feature works on DRBs only, whereas the Adaptive RLC Poll-Retransmission feature in

LTE applies to NSA LTE SRBs.

The feature uses the DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollRetransmitDl

and

the SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl

attributes as a starting point for calculating the poll retransmission interval on DRBs

and SRBs in downlink. Then, the feature can gradually increase the RLC poll interval.

The poll interval can be increased to a maximum of 500 milliseconds.

This

reduces

the number of poll retransmissions and extends the time to declare

RLF on downlink without impacting poll behavior for other UEs.

The DrbRlcUeCfg.dlMaxRetxThreshold

and

the SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold

attributes specify the number of poll retransmission attempts before declaring RLF on

downlink.

Without the feature enabled, attempting to extend the time to declare RLF by increasing

the value of the

DrbRlcUeCfg.dlMaxRetxThresholdand the

SignalingRadioBearer.dlMaxRetxThreshold

attributes results in degraded DRB throughput when the load is high in the gNodeB.

Increasing the value of the DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollRetransmitDl

and

the SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl

attributes results in wasted radio resources.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission

The feature improves network

performance.

Capacity and Performance

This feature improves retainability for gNodeBs in high load scenarios and for UEs in

poor radio conditions.

# 6 Performance of NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission

The feature has impact on a retainability-related KPI.

KPIs

For more information on KPIs, see Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

The feature extends time until RLF is declared, which results in more successful RLC

SDU transmissions in the downlink. This can be observed using the following PM

counters:

- NRCellDU.pmRlcArqDlAck
- NRCellDU.pmRlcArqDlNack

The extended time until RLF is declared also decreases the number of abnormal DRB and

UE context releases, which can be observed using the following PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalGnb5qi
- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalGnbAct5qi
- NRCellCU.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalGnb
- NRCellCU.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalGnbAct

The extended time until RLF is declared decreases the number of abnormal releases of

SCG radio resources triggered by the Secondary Node. This can be observed using the

NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalSgnbAct PM counter.

UEs in poor radio conditions remain connected longer because of the longer time to

declare RLF. This can increase the number of dropped packets, which can be observed

for each QoS using the following PM counters:

- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktTransDlDiscQos
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktTransDlDiscAqmQos

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012638 MO instance.
2. Set the UeAdaptiveRlcUeCfg.ueAdaptiveRlcRetxMode attribute to ENABLED to enable the downlink poll retransmission timer based on the number of retransmission attempts.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012638 MO instance.
2. Set the UeAdaptiveRlcUeCfg.ueAdaptiveRlcRetxMode attribute to DISABLED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Service-Adaptive RLC Poll Retransmission

The poll timer can be configured for any service and any UE group separately using the UE

Grouping Framework feature. Group- and service-specific settings can be configured using

the UeAdaptiveRlcUeCfg MO.

Table 4 shows the difference in poll

intervals and total time passed since the initial transmission of the message with the

feature activated and deactivated.

In this example, the

DrbRlcUeCfg.dlMaxRetxThreshold

attribute is set to 8, and the

DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollRetransmitDl

attribute is set to 80.

Table 4   Difference of Poll Interval and Time to RLF with Feature Activated

| Feature State   | Number of poll retransmissions                  |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |    6 |    7 | 8     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-------|
| DEACTIVATED     | Poll interval in milliseconds                   |  80 |  80 |  80 |  80 |  80 |  80 |   80 |   80 | 80    |
| DEACTIVATED     | Time since initial transmission in milliseconds |   0 |  80 | 160 | 240 | 320 | 400 |  480 |  560 | 640*  |
| ACTIVATED       | Poll interval in milliseconds                   |  80 |  80 |  80 | 160 | 320 | 500 |  500 |  500 | 500   |
| ACTIVATED       | Time since initial transmission in milliseconds |   0 |  80 | 160 | 240 | 400 | 720 | 1220 | 1720 | 2220* |

The time to RLF can be extended further if the maximum number of retransmissions is

configured for up to 16 or 32 retransmissions.
