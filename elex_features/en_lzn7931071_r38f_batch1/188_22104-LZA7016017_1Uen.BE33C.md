Summary

The feature allows the deactivation of TX antenna branches for NR Massive MIMO

Mid-Band radios at the configured traffic load level. Deactivating antenna branches

results in lower energy consumption for the radio unit. It can also result in

degraded end-user performance and decreased coverage.

Time windows and traffic load level thresholds can be configured for the activation

and deactivation of antenna branches.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

The deactivation of antenna branches can have a negative effect on features that are

related to coverage or data throughput.

Feature Dependencies

When the feature is enabled and antenna branches are muted, coverage and capacity are

negatively affected. This might decrease the performance of several features.

The following are examples of features that might be negatively affected by the

deactivation of antenna branches:

- Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming (FAJ 121 5397)
- NR Dynamic Power Optimizer (FAJ 121 5443)
- Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing (FAJ 121 5336)

The feature affects the value of beamforming gain approximations. After enabling the

NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature, some features might operate in a more

conservative way. Changes can be observed through the KPIs of the affected

features.

The following are examples of features that might operate in a more conservative

way:

- NR Support for CBRS (FAJ 121 5438)
- Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit (FAJ 121 5231)
- EMF Power Lock Mid-Band (FAJ 121 5015)

Hardware

The feature is supported only on TDD Massive MIMO Mid-Band radio units with 32TX/32RX

or 64TX/64RX antenna configuration.

Limitations

The feature does not support overlapping time windows in the same

MMimoSleepTimeGroup class. When configuring several time

windows for the activation of the feature, the start of the time window must be set

to a later time than the end of the previous time window.

The feature does not support Split Mode radio configuration.

Enabling the feature in Mixed Mode radio configuration might limit the amount of

energy savings. The feature mutes only NR antenna branches. LTE antenna branches are

not affected by the feature.

The feature is supported by the following codebook configurations:

- (8,2) for 32-port CSI-RS
- (8,1) for 16-port CSI-RS

Other configurations can cause high KPI degradation.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

When the TX mute function is enabled, the gNodeB can turn off parts of the Massive

MIMO radio antenna panel.

When the TX mute function is enabled, the gNodeB continuously tracks the cell load. The

gNodeB compares the cell load to the operator-defined thresholds to decide whether to

mute or unmute downlink TX antenna branches.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

When deciding downlink TX antenna branch activation and deactivation, the gNodeB goes

through the following process:

1. The PRB utilization and the number of RRC connected UEs in the cell are measured.
2. These measurements are collected and averaged.
3. The averaged measurements are compared to the sleep thresholds that are set in the following attributes: Note: If the RRC-related threshold is deactivated, only PRB utilization is used to determine the cell load.
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownPrbThreshDl
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownRrcConnThresh
4. If cell load falls below the value of both sleep thresholds, the MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownMonitorDurTimer timer is started.
5. Downlink TX antenna branches are muted if the cell load stays below the values of the sleep thresholds for the duration of the timer. The Massive MIMO radio enters TX mute sleep state.
6. During the sleep duration, the PRB utilization and the number of RRC connected UEs continue to be monitored.Note: After every five consecutive minutes of being in TX mute sleep state, the radio unit momentarily wakes up to maintain correct calibration.
7. The averaged measurements are compared to the wake-up thresholds that are set in the following attributes:
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpPrbThreshDl
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpRrcConnThresh
8. If the cell load reaches the value of at least one of the wake-up thresholds, the MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpMonitorDurTimer timer is started.
9. Downlink TX antenna branches are unmuted if the cell load reaches the value of at least one of the wake-up thresholds for the duration of the timer. The Massive MIMO radio wakes up.

SSB Power Boost for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

When the radio unit enters a TX mute sleep state, the SSB transmission loses 3 dB of

power in Mid-Band cells. The SSB power boost for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

functionality applies additional power boost when the sector carrier is in active

Massive MIMO sleep. The power boost no longer applies when the sector carrier wakes

up.

To recover the amount of power lost in the SSB channel when the TX mute function is

active, it is recommended to set the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep attribute to a value of 3.

Otherwise, it is recommended to set the value of the attribute to 0.

The combined value of the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost and

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep attributes must be set as

shown in Table 2.

Table 2   Combined Values of the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost and

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep attributes

| Bandwidth       | Combined Value (in dB)   |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 10 MHz          | Less than or equal to 1  |
| 15 MHz          | Less than or equal to 3  |
| 20 MHz          | Less than or equal to 4  |
| 30 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 40 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 50 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 60 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 70 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 80 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 90 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 100 MHz         | Less than or equal to 6  |
| Other bandwidth | 0                        |

The NRCellDU.actualSsbPowerBoost attribute is updated with the

calculated combined power boost value from the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost and

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep attributes when the TX mute

function is active.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

The feature can

provide energy savings by muting TX antenna branches.

Capacity and Performance

The feature allows the muting of TX antenna branches, which results in lower energy

consumption. Muting the TX antenna branches can also cause worse performance in the

affected cell.

When antenna branches are muted, different channels are impacted in the following

ways:

- In common channels, reduced power results in a 3 dB degradation. This degradation might affect coverage KPIs and initial access KPIs negatively.
- In data channels, reduced power and beamforming gain loss results in more degradation than common channels. This degradation might affect performance KPIs negatively, for example cell throughput and DRB drop rate.

During sleep mode, half of the CSI-RS ports are muted. This reduces the number of

expected rank 3 and 4 reports from UEs.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

The following attributes can be used to customize feature behavior:

| NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled  MMimoSleepProfile.sleepMode                          | Enable and disable control for the detection function and the TX mute                                 function.   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MMimoSleepTimeWindow.dayOfWeek  MMimoSleepTimeWindow.startTime  MMimoSleepTimeWindow.stopTime | A sleep time window that indicates when the TX mute function is                                 activated.        |
| MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownPrbThreshDl  MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownRrcConnThresh            | Sleep threshold values for each cell.                                                                             |
| MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpPrbThreshDl  MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpRrcConnThresh                | Wake-up threshold values for each cell.                                                                           |
| MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownMonitorDurTimer                                                   | Sleep timer duration for each cell.                                                                               |
| MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpMonitorDurTimer                                                     | Wake-up timer duration for each cell.                                                                             |

One sleep profile can be linked to one or more sleep time windows. One or more sleep time

windows can be linked to one sleep time group.

The feature can be configured on sector carrier level.

The feature can be enabled on one or multiple cells on the node. When the feature is

active, the node performs traffic detection. When the TX mute function is active, the

traffic is compared to the sleep and wake-up threshold values to mute and unmute antenna

branches.

The detection function can be used without a license to evaluate and configure the

feature with optimal threshold settings.

It is recommended to allow a planning phase of one week with the detection function. This

planning phase can be used to find the time intervals where the Massive MIMO radio can

be put to sleep to achieve the preferred level of power savings.

In the planning phase, the feature must be tuned to find the wanted balance between the

level of power savings and the level of performance degradation when in sleep mode.

When the wanted feature configuration is reached, the TX mute function can be turned on.

One feature license is required for each node to enable the TX mute capability on all

the cells on the node.

## 9.1 Sleep Time Window Configuration

The MMimoSleepTimeWindow.dayOfWeek attribute can be used to configure

the day or days during which the monitoring period is active. The start and end times of

this monitoring period can be configured with the

MMimoSleepTimeWindow.startTime and

MMimoSleepTimeWindow.stopTime attributes.

Separate monitoring periods must be set for each day. One or more monitoring periods can

be set for each day. During the monitoring period, the feature monitors the downlink PRB

utilization and the number of connected UEs to determine when to activate sleep

mode.

The time window configuration cannot cover more than one day. For example, if the

operator wants to set a time window from 22:00 on Wednesday to 04:00 on Thursday, two

separate time windows must be set from 22:00 to 23:59 on Wednesday and from 00:00 to

04:00 on Thursday.

When configuring two time windows in the same MMimoSleepTimeGroup

class, the start of the later time window must be set to a later time than the end of

the previous time window.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q1.0: SSB Power Boost for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

The feature enhancement enables a dynamic power boost in the SSB transmission to

ensure stable RSRP values when the NR Massive MIMO Sleep feature is activated.

| Feature Name           | NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5094                 |
| Value Package Name     | Massive MIMO Enabler         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4004                 |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type            | NR                           |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                     |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement compensates for a 3 dB power loss in the SSB transmission

when the NR Massive MIMO Sleep feature is active in Mid-Band cells. This additional

power boost is applied when the sector carrier is in active Massive MIMO sleep, and

it is no longer applied when the sector carrier wakes up.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement restores full coverage for the SSB channel and provides

stable RSRP values when the antenna is muted.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep attribute. To recover the

amount of power lost in the SSB channel when the TX mute function is active, it is

recommended to set the attribute to a value of 3. Otherwise, it is recommended to

set the value of the attribute to 0.

The feature enhancement is used in combination with the SSB Power Boost feature. The

combined value of NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost and

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep must be set as shown in

Table 4

Table 4   Combined Values of NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost and

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoostMMimoSleep

| Bandwidth       | Combined Value (in dB)   |
|-----------------|--------------------------|

| 15 MHz          | Less than or equal to 3  |
| 20 MHz          | Less than or equal to 4  |
| 30 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 40 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 50 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 60 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 70 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 80 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 90 MHz          | Less than or equal to 6  |
| 100 MHz         | Less than or equal to 6  |
| Other bandwidth | 0                        |

The NRCellDU.actualSsbPowerBoost attribute is updated with the

calculated combined power boost from the two attributes when the TX mute function is

active.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

total

time that the power amplifier is switched off for Tx branches. This time period

can

be measured on MO levels for Radio, RF Port, and

Band

for radio units.

The

feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Multi-level observability of the total time a Tx branch is switched off in seconds and percentages regardless of radio node configurations and activated sleep features

## Appendix A.e: 24.Q4.0: Automatic Handling of Daylight Saving for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

This feature enhancement allows the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature to

automatically adjust to Daylight Saving Time (DST).

| Feature Name           | NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5094                 |
| Value Package Name     | Massive MIMO Enabler         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4004                 |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                     |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides a mechanism to automatically adjust the sleep time

windows, configured in the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature, for DST. This

eliminates the need for manual adjustment for DST.

This feature enhancement also introduces an improvement to the TX mute function of

the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature. The duration of the periodic wake-up, used

for

calibration,

is reduced from about 60 seconds to about 5 seconds to increase potential sleep

time.

Capacity and Performance

The NRCellDU.pmMassiveMimoSleepTimeTxMute PM counter is expected

to increase as a result of the reduced periodic wake-up duration of the TX mute

function.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

MMimoSleepTimeWindow.daylightTimeOffsetApplied attribute to

define the DST offset added to the start and end time of sleep time windows for

automatic DST adjustment.

To enable automatic DST adjustment, the following attributes must be configured:

- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeStartDate
- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeEndDate
- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeOffset

If the values of the attributes are empty, automatic DST adjustment is disabled.

The sleep time windows configured for the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature must be

set up according to the local standard time. The values of the following attributes

must be expressed in UTC and the local standard time offset must be added to

them:

- MMimoSleepTimeWindow.dayOfWeek
- MMimoSleepTimeWindow.startTime
- MMimoSleepTimeWindow.stopTime

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
