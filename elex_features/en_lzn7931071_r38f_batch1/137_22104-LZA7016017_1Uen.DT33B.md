Summary and Benefits

The Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band feature provides advanced beamforming

capability to the gNodeB. Advanced beamforming is reciprocity-based and it uses the

SRS transmitted by the UEs.

The beams formed with this feature are UE-specific and the feature can mitigate the

interference between the users better than the codebook-based Downlink Multi-User

MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature.

Since the interference between the UEs is reduced, the gNodeB can transmit to

several UEs at the same time, using the same physical resources. Each UE can receive

transmission over more than one MIMO layer.

The feature can provide the following benefits if the radio conditions, the amount of

data and the location of the UEs are favorable:

- Improved downlink multi-user MIMO service performance
- Increased spectral efficiency
- Increased potential downlink cell throughput

For more information, see Interaction between the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature and the Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band Feature.

Hardware

The feature requires NR Mid-Band AAS radios with eCPRI. Mid-Band AAS radios with 16,

32, or 64 antennas are supported. The feature also supports the same Baseband units

as the Massive MIMO Mid-Band feature. For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.

The required bandwidth on eCPRI links for the Baseband unit increases with the number

of layers used in the cell. For example, to support the maximum number of downlink

layers that the feature provides for a cell of 100-MHz bandwidth, more than 10 Gbps

is needed between the radio unit and the Baseband unit. The required bandwidth on

eCPRI links can be calculated with the CPRI and eCPRI Capacity calculation tool.

Coscheduling more than eight layers is not supported on AIR 1652, and the units in

RAN Compute groups 4.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

UEs capable of SRS transmission benefit from this feature.

The UE sends SRS if the SRS-ResourceSet.usage RRC parameter is set

to the antennaSwitching value.

Interaction between the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

Feature and the Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band Feature

For the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature to operate

correctly with the Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band feature, CSI-RS needs

to be configured for 32 ports. Otherwise, either the NR Directional Control for EMF

Power Lock Mid-Band feature or the Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

feature must be disabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

With this feature, the gNodeB can use the SRS transmitted by the UEs in the uplink to

improve PDSCH beamforming and to coschedule up to eight UEs in the same downlink slot, using

the same physical resources.

The feature takes advantage of the reciprocity of the TDD

transmission. Reciprocity means that in a TDD cell, the same frequency is used for

downlink and uplink transmissions. The gNodeB uses the SRS transmitted by the UEs in the

uplink for downlink channel estimation, which is used for beamforming in the PDSCH.

Beams based on SRS are more precise than the beams based on codebook type-1.

Compared to the codebook-based Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band

feature, the advanced feature provides higher downlink throughput and better inter-layer

interference mitigation. As a result, with the Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO

Mid-Band feature, the spatial separation between the UEs can be smaller. These

differences are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Figure 2   Codebook-Based Downlink Beams to Multiple Users

Figure 3   Advanced Downlink Beams to Multiple Users

The feature supports up to 16 beam layers for advanced multi-user MIMO in 100-MHz

bandwidth in at least one cell. More than eight layers are supported only on units in

RAN Compute group 5 and higher. This capability is shared among all the cells in the

same gNodeB where this feature or the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band

feature is enabled.

## 3.1 Operational Process of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

Figure 4   Basic Operational Process

1. The UEs transmit SRS.
2. The gNodeB evaluates the UEs with SRS configured as candidates for advanced multi-user MIMO and determines which UEs can be paired in every downlink slot.
3. The gNodeB determines the downlink layers to be used with multi-user MIMO based on the following criteria: The maximum number of layers for each UE configured in the system that can be used for multi-user MIMO. The quality of the channel from each sounded port The rank indicator from the UE The value of the NRCellDU.maxNoOfAdvancedDlMuMimoLayers attribute
4. The gNodeB has downlink data to transmit to the UEs.
5. The gNodeB coschedules the data for the UEs in the same downlink slot, using the same physical resources.
6. The gNodeB forms custom beams to each coscheduled UE for the PDSCH transmission.

Sometimes, it might be better to use advanced single-user MIMO with a UE configured with

SRS. The following factors determine when the gNodeB chooses multi-user MIMO over

single-user MIMO:

- PRB utilization is high in the cell.
- The amount of downlink data to be transmitted to the UE is considered high.
- The estimated downlink throughput with multi-user MIMO is larger than with single-user MIMO.
- The estimated effective speed of the UE is lower than or equal to the threshold set by the NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh attribute.

Additional Information

Descriptions:

- Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

## 3.2 Deployment Scenarios of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

The benefits of the feature are most observable in sites with the following

characteristics:

- Sites with high load to favor the multi-user MIMO pairing opportunities.
- Sites where UE mobility is limited.Note: Compared to codebook-based beamforming, advanced beamforming is in general more sensitive to the UE speed due to the aging channel estimates.
- Sites where the inter-site distances are close.

# 4 Network Impact of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

The feature can improve the average downlink cell throughput with advanced

beamforming.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases spectral efficiency. As a result, the feature makes it possible

to achieve higher downlink throughput in the cell.

Interfaces

SRS resources are configured for UEs capable of SRS in good enough channel conditions

with an RRCReconfiguration message.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

The feature uses MO attributes that control advanced downlink MIMO and the

configuration of SRS in the cell. All the MO attribute requirements of the prerequisite

Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band feature apply here as well.

# 6 Performance of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

When the feature is used in favorable circumstances, the values of downlink cell

throughput KPIs can increase.

KPIs

The feature provides the greatest benefits if several SRS-capable UEs in good channel

conditions need downlink service at the same time. In these circumstances, the

values of the following KPIs increase:

- DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS
- Filtered MBB DL MAC DRB Throughput
- Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput considering traffic
- Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PDSCH slot only

The magnitude of the increase in the KPI values depends on the following

factors:

| Factor                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Channel conditions                    | The feature provides the greatest benefits if several UEs are                                         in good enough channel conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Movement of the UEs                   | The feature provides the greatest benefits if the UEs are                                         stationary, or only slowly moving.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Number of SRS-capable UEs in the cell | If there is a high number of SRS-capable UEs in the cell,                                         this feature is more likely to be utilized. As a result, it                                         is more likely that a KPI increase can be observed.                                                                 |
| Spatial separation between the UEs    | The closer the UEs are to each other, the higher the                                         interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| UE traffic profiles                   | If a high number of UEs need a large amount of data at the                                         same time in the cell, this feature is more likely to be                                         utilized. As a result, it is more likely that a KPI increase                                         can be observed. |

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band

## 9.1 Attribute Configurations for SRS Configuration and Precoder Selection

Switching between codebook-based and reciprocity-based transmissions for UEs is

configurable through attribute settings in the gNodeB on a cell level.

The gNodeB switches between codebook-based and reciprocity-based beamforming based on the

following checks:

- SRS port validity checks
- UE-estimated effective speed

SRS Configuration

The following attributes can be used to configure aperiodic SRS or coexisting

aperiodic and periodic SRS-capable UEs on a cell level:

- NRCellDU.aperiodicSrsEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled

The NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth attribute can be used to switch

between full-band and half-band SRS. The half-band SRS setting allows the UE to

transmit SRS with increased coverage. Full-band SRS uses one uplink OFDM symbol in a

special slot, while half-band SRS uses two.

The following attributes can be used to allocate periodic SRS resources to UEs with

heavy downlink traffic:

- NRCellDU.nrSrsDlBufferVolThr
- NRCellDU.nrSrsDlPacketAgeThr

The NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh attribute can be used to configure

the effective speed limit for the configuration of SRS.

Precoder Selection

The UE-estimated effective speed threshold values can be configured through the

NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh and the

NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh attributes. Depending on the

UE-estimated effective speed, the gNodeB configures beamforming in the following

way:

Table 4   Beamforming Configuration Depending on UE-Estimated Effective

Speed

| Higher                                                                                                                                                                 | Higher                                                                                                                                                                 | Codebook-based beamforming            |

The following attributes can be used to configure precoder selection through the

configuration of SRS port validity checks:

- NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable
- NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh

The NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable can be configured to

check if the SRS ports of the UE are all usable for reciprocity-based beamforming.

If any SRS ports are not valid, the gNodeB uses codebook-based beamforming

weights.

The NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute can be used to

set the two different threshold values to be compared with the correlation values of

the channel estimations from SRS transmissions. This allows the gNodeB to determine

the number of valid SRS ports that can be used for reciprocity-based beamforming by

checking the correlation thresholds for the different number of SRS ports.

The first threshold value is applicable to UEs that have two valid SRS ports, where

the antenna deployment might lead to highly correlated channel information from the

two SRS ports. The first threshold value must be set to a lower number than the

second threshold. The second threshold value is applicable to any UE. The value is

used to prevent cases where the UE transmits SRS from the different SRS resources of

the UE from the same physical antenna.

The NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable and the

NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attributes do not

interact with each other.

Summary and Benefits

The gNodeB determines the advanced beamforming weights based on the uplink SRS

transmissions from the UE. The UE uses all of its SRS ports to transmit SRS, but

some UEs might not be able to transmit SRS with equal power among its SRS ports, and

the quality of some of the SRS ports might not be enough to use advanced

beamforming. In these cases, codebook-based beamforming can provide higher downlink

throughput.

This feature enhancement enables the gNodeB to switch to codebook-based beamforming

in a slot when the SRS SINR of the SRS ports in a UE is insufficient for advanced

beamforming.

For every UE in the cell configured with SRS resources, the gNodeB assesses the

quality of each SRS port of the UE. The SRS SINR of the SRS ports is compared with a

preconfigured threshold, and the SRS ports are considered valid if they exceed the

threshold. The gNodeB switches to codebook-based beamforming if the number of valid

ports is lower than the rank reported by the UE.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink throughput might increase if the gNodeB switches to codebook-based

beamforming when it is more efficient than advanced beamforming, based on the SRS

SINR measurements of the SRS ports of the UE. Depending on the number of UEs

transmitting SRS with different power among their ports, the number of downlink

slots used for advanced beamforming can decrease, which can be observed through the

following counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoTxRankDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoTxRankDistr

This feature enhancement has no associated KPIs. However, the following Performance

Indicators can decrease because fewer advanced beamforming transmissions occur:

- SRS Utilization
- SU-MIMO Average Advanced Downlink Resource Block Symbol Utilization
- SU-MIMO Average Advanced Beamforming PDSCH Resource Block Symbol Utilization
- Average SU-MIMO Advanced Beamforming Users
- Average SU-MIMO Advanced Beamforming Layers
- MU-MIMO Average Advanced Beamforming Downlink Resource Block Symbol Utilization
- MU-MIMO Average Advanced Beamforming PDSCH Resource Block Symbol Utilization

on resource fair scheduling, see Scheduling Algorithm in Mid-Band in

Manage Massive MIMO NR.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- More opportunities are provided for MU-MIMO coscheduling.
- Average downlink cell throughput might increase.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on MU-MIMO utilization and the number of UEs that can be scheduled as

SU-MIMO or MU-MIMO in the cell, the feature enhancement might increase the average

downlink cell throughput by increasing PDSCH utilization in MU-MIMO.

Operation

If carrier aggregation is enabled, the

NRCellDU.caPerCcFairnessWeightEnabled attribute must be set

to TRUE in order for the feature enhancement to be beneficial for

carrier aggregation-capable UEs. The feature enhancement is only applicable in the

PCell carrier of the carrier aggregation configuration.

The NRCellDU.caPerCcFairnessWeightEnabled attribute can be used

with any number of component carriers.

some UEs from the MU-MIMO pairing and use advanced SU-MIMO instead when there is

interference between UEs that are closely located to each other and there is good

line of sight between the node and the UEs.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved decision-making when pairing UEs into the same MU-MIMO group
- Improved average downlink cell throughput

UE throughput. However, the feature enhancement can increase average downlink cell

throughput in networks where the Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band feature

is enabled.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables the use of aperiodic SRS in NR Mid-Band cells. The UE

reports aperiodic SRS capability and the gNodeB configures aperiodic SRS for the

UE.

The configuration mechanism for aperiodic SRS is the same as for periodic SRS,

however triggering is handled by DCI format 1\_1, which results in more dynamic

resource allocation compared to periodic SRS. The gNodeB can dynamically trigger UEs

to transmit SRS on demand based on UE traffic, which means SRS resources are used

more efficiently and more UEs can be served with reciprocity-based beamforming.

Aperiodic SRS and periodic SRS cannot be configured for the same cell. All cells

belonging to the same gNodeB need to be configured with either aperiodic SRS or

periodic SRS.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- SRS resources can be more efficiently allocated to active downlink users. The gNodeB does not need to release the SRS resource of the UEs even if the channel quality is not sufficient for reciprocity-based beamforming.
- Downlink performance can be improved in good and medium channel conditions, as more users can be served by the gNodeB using reciprocity-based beamforming.
- The performance of high mobility UE can be improved in low-load cases, because the rapid changes in channel information can be tracked through back-to-back aperiodic SRS triggering.
- The battery life of UEs might be extended because the UE only transmits SRS aperiodically when it has downlink traffic.

Using aperiodic SRS can provide the previously listed benefits if the following

conditions are fulfilled in the cell:

- The traffic load is high.
- The SRS utilization for baseline periodic SRS is high.
- There are enough UEs capable of aperiodic SRS transmission.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement improves average downlink throughput because of the more

efficient use of SRS. Peak throughput is unaffected.

The feature enhancement introduces the following PI to monitor the number of active

SRS users on average:

The performance indicators affected by the feature enhancement are shown in Table 5:

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides another option to help with the decision making of

the gNodeB to choose the most suitable beamforming mode for the UE. Advanced

beamforming is more suitable for stationary or slowly moving UEs. Codebook-based

beamforming provides better throughput for moving UEs.

The estimated effective speed, which takes the Doppler effect into consideration, is

used to switch between advanced and codebook-based beamforming. If the estimated

effective speed of a UE is below configured thresholds, the UE can be granted SRS

resources, and advanced beamforming is used for that UE.

For the beamforming mode switch, hysteresis is considered. This means that the

beamforming mode switch does not occur when the estimated effective speed of the UE

exceeds or drops below a threshold. This way, constant beamforming mode switching

can be avoided that might be otherwise triggered because of estimation noise.

If periodic SRS is configured in the gNodeB, the UE can be configured with periodic

SRS when its estimated effective speed is lower than or equal to the threshold or

thresholds. The SRS resources are released if the estimated effective speed of the

UE exceeds the thresholds.

If aperiodic SRS is configured in the gNodeB, the aperiodic SRS can be triggered if

the estimated effective speed of the UE is lower than or equal to the threshold or

thresholds. Thresholds tuned for periodic SRS might not be optimal for aperiodic

SRS, so they must be retuned to get optimal performance.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement might improve SRS resource utilization, downlink UE

throughput, and downlink cell throughput. For some cells, especially if the

thresholds are configured too low, downlink cell throughput might decrease while the

downlink UE throughput increases.

The distribution of the

measured

effective speed of UEs in a cell can be observed through the

NRCellDU.pmUeEffDopplerSpeedDistr

counter.

The following counters can be used to observe the distribution of resources used by

advanced beamforming and codebook-based beamforming for SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoUserDistr

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh

and the NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh attributes. The feature

enhancement does not take effect if the default values are used. Depending on the UE

estimated effective speed, the feature enhancement operates the following way:

Summary and Benefits

With the feature enhancement, aperiodic and periodic SRS can be configured in the

same cell and on the same gNodeB-DU. The coexisting aperiodic and periodic SRS mode

is enabled with an attribute.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Periodic SRS UE capacity increases when the SRS periodicity of the cell is equal to 80 slots.
- Throughput increases in cells with high load where aperiodic SRS-capable UE penetration is high under good to moderate channel conditions.

One of the following modes is supported in the cell:

- Aperiodic SRS
- Periodic SRS
- Coexisting aperiodic and periodic SRS

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement can improve reciprocity-based beamforming use and downlink

throughput compared to periodic SRS by efficiently using available SRS resources if

the following conditions are met at the specific site:

- 100% SRS use that is reached during busy hour using periodic SRS mode
- Small inter-site distance to ensure good SRS coverage
- High downlink payload, for example more than 50% busy hour downlink resource block symbol use
- High ratio of UEs capable of aperiodic SRS transmission in terms of payload

If the conditions are not met and the feature enhancement is activated, downlink

throughput and reciprocity-based beamforming use might degrade.

The performance of the feature enhancement can be observed through the following PM

counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacActiveSrsUe
- NRCellDU.pmMacRbSymUsedPdschCbRatDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacSrsPdschAgeDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlRat

A degradation in codebook-based MU-MIMO resource utilization might be observed in

networks with a high penetration of aperiodic SRS-capable UEs.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled attribute to enable the

coexistence of aperiodic and periodic SRS-capable UEs in all Mid-Band cells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement is supported on RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5 and

6.

Only UEs capable of aperiodic SRS transmission can benefit from aperiodic SRS.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves UE effective speed estimation when the Uplink Data

and DMRS Multiplexing feature is also active in the node. The following PM counters

are affected:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayersDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResUsedAntSwitching
- NRCellDU.pmUeEffDopplerSpeedDistr

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases the probability of lower effective speed

estimation, which can be observed in the distribution of the

NRCellDU.pmUeEffDopplerSpeedDistr PM counter.

The updated effective speed estimation might

affect

Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resource utilization, which can be observed through

the NRCellDU.pmRadioSrsResUsedAntSwitching PM counter.

The updated effective speed estimation might

affect

downlink multi-user and single-user MIMO, which can be observed through the

following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayersDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschMimoUserDistr

The impact on the PM counters might vary depending on the values configured for the

NRCellDU.speedAdvMuThresh

and

the NRCellDU.speedAdvSuThresh attributes. If the feature is

configured

after the Uplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature is activated in the node, it is

recommended to

reconfigure

these attributes.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the gNodeB more accuracy in deciding whether to use

reciprocity-based beamforming, improving downlink performance.

The feature enhancement introduces two attributes that allow the gNodeB to assess if

the SRS transmitted by the UE can be used for reciprocity-based beamforming in the

downlink.

The gNodeB determines if an SRS-configured UE can use reciprocity-based beamforming

for each downlink

slot,

based on the number of SRS ports that are assessed to be usable. If an

SRS-configured UE cannot use reciprocity-based beamforming, codebook-based

beamforming is used.

Depending on the number of UEs that transmit SRS unsuitable for reciprocity-based

beamforming, the feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved downlink cell throughput
- Improved downlink UE throughput
- Improved downlink BLER

Capacity and Performance

The Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PDSCH slot only KPI can be

used to observe the benefits of the feature enhancement.

The DL HARQ BLER PI can be used to observe the benefits of the feature

enhancement.

Codebook-based beamforming might be used as a fallback option for UEs that transmit

unsuitable SRS transmissions. For the effect of the number of such UEs on PIs, see

Table 7.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Average Codebook MIMO PDSCH Resource Block Symbol Utilization                                           | Increases |
| Average Reciprocity MU-MIMO PDSCH Resource Block Symbol                                     Utilization | Decreases |
| Average Reciprocity SU-MIMO PDSCH Resource Block Symbol                                     Utilization | Decreases |

The following PM counters are expected to decrease:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayersDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistrNote: Updated information in 25.Q2: Removed deprecated performance indicators and PM counters.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable
- NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh

There is no interaction between the

NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable and

NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attributes.

The NRCellDU.pairwiseSrsCorrelationThresh attribute has mandatory

impact at upgrade, while the impact of the

NRCellDU.advDlBfWhenAllSrsPortsUsable attribute is

optional.

New parameters are introduced to the DuPerCellLinkAdaptationRep PM event. For the

list of the introduced PM event parameters, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement is supported on RAN Compute group 5 and higher.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
