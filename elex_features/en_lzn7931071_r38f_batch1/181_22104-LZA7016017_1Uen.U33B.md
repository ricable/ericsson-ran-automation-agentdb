Hardware

The feature is not supported on AIR 3284.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- The feature is not supported in PIM cancellation slots.
- The feature is not supported in the slots that send PIM training sequence.
- The feature is not supported in PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_0.
- ESS is not supported.

When activating the feature, PDSCH in PDCCH symbols

might receive interference from

PDCCH transmission of neighboring cells

resulting

in

decreased

feature gain or negative gain. Turning on the Coverage- and

Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming feature mitigates the interference.

If a cell has multiple UEs with unsupported chipsets and the UEs are not excluded

with the UE Grouping Framework, KPI degradation might be seen in that cell.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Downlink Data and PDCCH Multiplexing

The feature uses an automatic

procedure

and checks UE compatibility to allocate PDSCH to unused PDCCH resources.

The feature allocates PDSCH to unused PDCCH resources for supported UEs in Low-Band and

Mid-Band cells using an automatic procedure. For more information, see 3GPPTS

38.211.

The following function and feature are used to detect UEs that are not supported:

| UE chipset detection                          |    | This function identifies chipset types that are not                             supported                             by the feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| UE                         Grouping Framework |    | The selection criteria in the UE Grouping Framework feature are used to                             define a UE group. UEs in the UE group are identified as supported UEs                             based on the configuration of the attributes under the                                 PdcchReuseForPdsch and the                                 PdcchReuseForPdschUeCfg MO classes.

If a UE is supported, the following criteria must also be

true:

- The PDCCH resource blocks carrying DCIs of other UEs do not overlap with PDSCH resource blocks.
- The PDCCH resource blocks carrying uplink DCIs that belong to the UE do not overlap with PDSCH resource blocks.
- The PDSCH resource without multiplexed PDCCH is unable to empty the downlink buffer.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Downlink Data and PDCCH Multiplexing

The feature improves downlink throughput,

affects

PDCCH performance, and affects the Uu interface.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves downlink throughput. Downlink spectral efficiency in each PRB

and downlink latency can also improve.

PDCCH peformance might degrade because of the potential interference between the

PDSCH allocated to PDCCH symbols in the serving cell and the PDCCH of neighboring

cells.

This feature has no impact on PDCCH capacity. However, the

NRCellDU.pmMacPdcchBlockingPuschOccasions PM counter may

increase in some cases, which is an expected behavior.

Interfaces

The RRCReconfiguration and RRCResume messages are

updated with information on the

NR

PDSCH time domain allocation in the Uu interface.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Downlink Data and PDCCH Multiplexing
