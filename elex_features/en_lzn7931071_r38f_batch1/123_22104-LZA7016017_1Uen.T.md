# 1 Uplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing Overview

The feature transmits uplink data in unused resource elements in symbols carrying NR

PUSCH DMRS.

Summary

The feature allows NR uplink data to be transmitted in symbols carrying DMRS. This is

achieved by multiplexing PUSCH with DMRS, so that PUSCH replaces unused resource

elements in symbols carrying DMRS. Such multiplexing applies to every resource block

that is allocated for PUSCH in a given transmission.

The feature can have the following benefits:

- Increased efficiency in NR resource element use
- Increased NR uplink throughput

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

The number of resource elements can be increased by multiplexing PUSCH and DMRS, but

DMRS power boost is not triggered.

Figure 1   Resource Element Use without and with PUSCH and DMRS Multiplexing

As Figure 1 shows, the number of resource

elements used for PUSCH can be increased by multiplexing PUSCH and DMRS on the same

symbol. More resource elements translate to higher peak rate. However, the DMRS power

boost is not triggered while PUSCH and DMRS are multiplexed. Boosting DMRS power can

improve PUSCH decoding, especially at low SINR. This means that a trade-off exists

between PUSCH decoding performance and gaining additional resource elements for uplink

data.

Thus, if the PUSCH is multiplexed with DMRS for a given PUSCH transmission in good SINR

conditions, throughput gains are expected with the feature. To prevent uplink throughput

degradation in the cell, the gNodeB does not multiplex PUSCH with DMRS for a given PUSCH

transmission if the gNodeB-estimated SINR in the cell is not good

enough.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

The feature can increase uplink throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The NR uplink throughput is expected to increase. The actual throughput gain depends

on the channel conditions.

The average MCS for PUSCH decreases slightly when the feature is activated.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Uplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

| Normalized Average UL MAC Cell Throughput considering successful                                     PUSCH slot only | For sustained traffic, this KPI shows an increase because of the                                     increased amount of data in uplink transmission.  For traffic occurring in bursts, the KPI might show an increase                                     because of the increased amount of data and the decreased time                                     for PUSCH scheduling.                       |

This can show the throughput gain more accurately if the cell                                     contains multiple UEs, and the number of UEs with DMRS                                     multiplexing is less than the number of UEs without DMRS                                     multiplexing. |
