# 1 Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band Overview

This feature enables coverage-optimized PRB allocation for the link adaptation CSI

report. It also allows inner PRB allocation for PUSCH and moves the PRB allocation for

PUCCH, Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, and PRACH. In addition, dynamic waveform switching

is allowed on the uplink SCG radio resources when the primary uplink path is MCG radio

resources.

Summary

The feature enhances the robustness of the uplink channels by improving the uplink

performance at the cell edge.

The feature allows inner PRB allocation for PUSCH. For PUCCH format 0, the Scheduling Request

PUCCH resource, and PRACH, the PRB allocation is changed from the edge of the

bandwidth to the inner region. Inner PRB allocation is prioritized for the

Scheduling Request PUCCH resource.

The feature also optimizes PRB allocation for link adaptation CSI to improve CSI

coverage. Inner PRB allocation decreases the Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) when link

adaptation reduces the number of scheduled PRBs. Inner PRB allocation is applicable

in case of UEs on the cell edge in poor radio conditions.

The feature enables dynamic waveform switching between two-port Cyclic Prefix-OFDM (CP-OFDM)

and single-port Discrete Fourier Transform Spread-OFDM (DFTS-OFDM) on the uplink SCG

radio resources when the primary uplink path is the MCG radio resources.

When the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature performs waveform switching

to DFTS-OFDM for UEs in poor uplink coverage, the uplink SCells are released. This

way, lower MPR can be applied by UEs, which leads to higher uplink SINR. When the

waveform switches to CP-OFDM for UEs in good uplink radio conditions, uplink carrier

aggregation is configured if possible.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- Only contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation is supported.
- An aggregated channel bandwidth of up to 800 MHz is supported. Actual MPR gain is observable with an aggregated bandwidth of up to 400 MHz.
- MPR gain for inner PRB allocation can be considered only with the following elements for PUSCH, PUCCH, the periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, and PRACH: A single uplink carrier The DFTS-OFDM waveform
- For the periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, the target number of UEs cannot be reached in the 50 MHz bandwidth.
- Only PUCCH format 0 is supported.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band

The feature optimizes coverage in uplink PRB allocation for the link adaptation CSI

report and improves MPR by enabling inner PRB allocation for PUSCH. PRB allocation is moved

to the inner region of the bandwidth for PUCCH, the Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, and

PRACH.

The feature introduces the following functions:

- Reduced PRB allocation for the link adaptation CSI reports on PUSCH
- Inner PRB allocation for PUSCH
- PRB allocation in the inner region for PUCCH, the Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, and PRACH Note: Only PUCCH format 0 is supported.
- Dynamic waveform switching between two-port CP-OFDM and single-port DFTS-OFDM on the uplink SCG radio resources when the primary uplink path is MCG radio resources.
- RRC reconfiguration of SCells at dynamic waveform and port switching

Operational Process

In link adaptation, the aperiodic CSI reports are transmitted over PUSCH. If the

Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active, the number of PRBs

allocated to the link adaptation CSI reports is decreased. This ensures better

reception of the link adaptation CSI reports. Therefore, instead of 32 PRBs, up to

four or eight PRBs are allocated to the link adaptation CSI report.

The decreased number of PRBs and inner PRB allocation reduce the MPR and improve

coverage. MPR specifies the decrease allowed in the transmitted maximum power that

enables the UE to pass ACLR requirements. The feature changes PRB allocation from

the bandwidth edge to the inner region for PUCCH, the Scheduling Request PUCCH

resource, and PRACH. Inner PRB allocation enables the scheduling of PRBs in the

center of the bandwidth, instead of using the band edge. This way, inner PRB

allocation can minimize inter-carrier interference. Inner PRB allocation for PUSCH

occurs when the number of scheduled PRBs is equal or less than one-third of the

total carrier bandwidth.

MPR gain can be achieved with the use of the following elements for inner PRB

allocation:

- An aggregated bandwidth of up to 400 MHz
- A single uplink component carrier of a 50 MHz or 100 MHz bandwidth for PUCCH, Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, and PRACH Note: Inner PRB allocation is avoided if two component carriers are used for PUCCH, Scheduling Request PUCCH resource, and PRACH. Inner PRB allocation can be performed with CP-OFDM on PUSCH.
- The DFTS-OFDM waveform

The feature supports intra-band contiguous uplink carrier aggregation, which can be

configured when the CP-OFDM waveform is used. However, MPR gain can only be obtained

with the DFTS-OFDM waveform. If DFTS-OFDM is used, only a single uplink component

carrier is configured.

The feature enables dynamic waveform switching between two-port CP-OFDM and

single-port DFTS-OFDM on the uplink SCG radio resources when the primary uplink path

is the MCG radio resources.

When the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature performs waveform

switching to DFTS-OFDM for UEs in poor uplink coverage, the uplink SCells are

released. This way, lower MPR can be applied by UEs, which leads to higher uplink

SINR. When the waveform switches to CP-OFDM for UEs in good uplink radio conditions,

uplink carrier aggregation is configured if possible.

SINR threshold, hysteresis, and prohibit timer can be further tuned if the default

values do not get the desired result. If further tuning is needed, next level of

support must be contacted.

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band

The feature improves uplink coverage and allows better MPR for UEs on the cell edge

or in bad radio conditions, or both.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhances the robustness of the uplink channels by improving the uplink

performance at the cell edge. The following characteristics of the feature allow for

a gain in coverage and MPR:

- Allocation of fewer PRBs to the link adaptation CSI report.
- Inner PRB allocation.
- Waveform switching to DFTS-OFDM is allowed when the primary uplink data path is the MCG radio resources.
- RRC reconfiguration of SCells at dynamic waveform and port switching

MPR gain can only be obtained with the DFTS-OFDM waveform. If DFTS-OFDM is used, only

a single uplink component carrier is configured.

Interfaces

The feature affects the X2AP interface. The list of the configured SCells are

included in the sCellsToReleaseList and the

sCellsToAddModList parameters in the

CellGroupConfig IE at RRC reconfiguration for releasing and

adding SCells when waveform and port switching is performed.
