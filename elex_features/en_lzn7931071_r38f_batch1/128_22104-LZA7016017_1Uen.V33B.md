Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Only the base RDN of the InactivityProfileUeCfg MO class is

applicable if the NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer feature license is not

present or the feature is deactivated.

The NAS inactivity timer is supported on the RAN Compute units of the following RAN

Compute groups:

- RAN Compute group 4
- RAN Compute group 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d
- RAN Compute group 6

Network Requirements

There are no network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer

The feature introduces MO attributes for configuring inactivity timers for UE

groups.

The feature introduces the following MO attributes for inactivity timers that can be

configured for each UE group:

- InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimer
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimerEndcSn
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimerNrdcSn

The attributes are configured when a DRB is initially set up, or when an NAS message is

received. The attribute configuration can be changed if the UE group is modified.

Only the base instance of the InactivityProfileUeCfg MO class is

applicable if the NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer feature license is not present,

or the feature is deactivated.

## 3.1 Configuration and Reconfiguration of the NAS Inactivity Timer

The configuration of the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) inactivity timer depends on the UE

group information and whether the feature is activated.

The feature allows the configuration of the Non-Access Stratum (NAS) inactivity timer on

UE group level.

Operational Process

1. The gNodeB receives the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, or sends any of the following messages: HANDOVER NOTIFY HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE RESPONSE PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE UE RADIO CAPABILITY CHECK RESPONSE UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT
2. The gNodeB selects the value of the InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime attribute based on the UE group information and whether the NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer feature is activated in the node.
3. The selected value of the NAS inactivity timer that corresponds to the UE is used for handling the NAS inactivity timer in the gNodeB.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer

Capacity and Performance

A lower value for the UE inactivity timers can increase signaling, which affects load

and capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer

## 9.1 Deprecation Handling for NAS Inactivity Timer Attribute

The feature introduces the

InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime attribute to allow

configuring

the

Non-Access

Stratum (NAS) inactivity timer on UE group level.

The InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime attribute

replaces

the deprecated GNBCUCPFunction.nasInactivityTime attribute. During

the software upgrade, the InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime

attribute is created with

the

same value set for the

GNBCUCPFunction.nasInactivityTime attribute. After the software

upgrade, the values of the two attributes can be adjusted separately.

During the deprecation period, the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHNasInactTimeEnabled attribute can be used

to define the attribute that is used to configure the NAS inactivity timer. If the value

of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHNasInactTimeEnabled attribute

is

set to

false, the value set for the

GNBCUCPFunction.nasInactivityTime attribute is used for the NAS

inactivity

timer.

If the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHNasInactTimeEnabled attribute is set to

true, the UE group information is used to select the corresponding

value for the NAS inactivity timer. The corresponding value is selected from the

InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime attribute.

## 10.2 23.Q2: MOM Configuration Rule Change for UE Grouping-Related Attributes

This feature enhancement introduces a non-backward-compatible change for an existing

MOM configuration rule in three MO classes. With this change, the affected classes apply the

MOM configuration rule that is required by the UE Grouping Framework.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 | Mandatory                              | Mandatory                         |

Summary and Benefits

MO classes that are adapted to the UE Grouping Framework feature contain a standard

set of UE group list attributes and a standard set of MOM configuration rules, which

enforce the correct setting of the UE group list attributes. This feature

enhancement introduces a non-backward-compatible change for one of the MOM

configuration rules related to the three affected MO classes, which are already

adapted to the UE Grouping Framework. This is to comply with the corresponding

standard UE Grouping Framework configuration rule.

The affected attributes comply with the following standard MOM configuration rule

after the change:

- For each preference UE group identifier that is defined in one or several UeCfg MO instances apart from the Base instance, there must be exactly one UeCfg MO instance that combines the specific preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute with an empty ueGroupList attribute.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The change affects the following MO classes and attributes:

- DUModified5qiUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DUModified5qiUeCfg.ueGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DrxProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- InactivityProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList

No upgrade conversion of the configuration is made by the system during node

upgrade.

The first time the MOM configuration rule is enforced after a software upgrade is

when a configuration transaction contains any changes related to the affected

UeCfg MO classes. This is true even if the configuration

transaction does not affect any values related to the

prefUeGroupList or the ueGroupList

attributes. This means that an existing configuration that does not comply with the

updated configuration rules is still used after the software update. The

non-compliant configuration is detected by the system only if a configuration

transaction affecting the MO classes is initiated.

The enforcement of the updated configuration rule causes behavior changes. The most

common examples are the following:

- Any MO transaction that contains configuration changes related to any of the affected UeCfg MO classes must always fulfill the updated configuration rule.
- It is not possible to create a UeCfg MO instance if the following conditions apply: The prefUeGroupList attribute includes a new preference UE group identifier, which is not included in any of the existing UeCfg MO instances and their prefUeGroupList attributes. The ueGroupList attribute is non-empty. The only exception is if the same MO transaction also includes the creation of a second UeCfg MO instance with the same new preference UE group identifier in the uePrefGroupList attribute combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute for this UeCfg MO instance.
- It is not possible to delete a UeCfg MO instance if the following conditions apply: The MO instance contains a preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute. There is another UeCfg MO instance with the same preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute combined with a non-empty ueGroupList attribute. The only exception is if both MO instances are deleted in the same MO transaction.
- If the prefUeGroupList attribute is empty with no previous configurations for all UeCfg MO instances, there is no impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.
