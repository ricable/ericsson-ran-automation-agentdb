Summary

This feature allows downlink carrier aggregation with three component carriers between up to

three Advanced RAN Coordination partners. The Advanced RAN Coordination partners

(gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules) are connected by an E5 link through the Advanced

RAN Coordination feature.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Increased downlink peak throughput.
- More efficient use of scattered spectrum.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

- For FDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 900 μs.
- For TDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 350 μs.
- Only NR standalone deployment is supported.
- For TDD-TDD carrier aggregation, the PCell and SCell must have the same TDD patterns.
- Maximum one capacity module can use FDD duplex mode in a gNodeB.
- The feature is not supported where the PCell has 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured and the SCells have more than 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured.
- UE throughput might decrease in sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three component carriers due to reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH. This is also valid when some or all the component carriers are external.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

## 2.1 Downlink Carrier Aggregation Features in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The NR downlink carrier aggregation features in Low-Band and Mid-Band use the same

SCell selection algorithm.

If a carrier aggregation feature with a higher number of component carriers is enabled,

the carrier aggregation features with a lower number of component carriers are also

enabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature allows the aggregation of three component carriers between up to three

gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules.

The UE connects to the SpCell, then the gNodeB runs the SCell selection algorithm. If all

conditions are met, the carrier aggregation-capable UE is configured with two downlink

SCells. The selected SCells are configured and activated as described in the NR DL Carrier Aggregation feature.

Three component carriers between up to three gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules can be used

for carrier aggregation. The Advanced RAN Coordination feature provides the E5 link

connectivity between the gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules.

# 4 Network Impact of NR 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves cell utilization and increases UE downlink

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cell utilization is expected to improve because downlink data transmission is

distributed across multiple component carriers. UE downlink throughput is increased

by aggregating three component carriers.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following interfaces to ensure that multiple SCells can be

configured at the same time:

- Uu interface: The size or the number of the RRCReconfiguration messages increases.
- F1 interface: The size of the UE Context Modification messages increases.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation

Additional PUCCH resources can be allocated by an existing attribute.

If the NR cells are intended to be used as SpCells for carrier                                 aggregation, setting the attribute to true prevents                                 downlink throughput degradation that can arise if PUCCH resource is                                 limited. |

# 7 Activate NR 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated in the appropriate MO instance. Additional

PUCCH resource must be allocated in the cell for carrier aggregation to avoid downlink

throughput degradation.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012600 MO instance.
2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to true.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. If the cell is not intended to be used as SpCell for carrier

aggregation, the additional PUCCH allocation must be stopped to avoid PUCCH

overhead.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012600 MO instance.

If the cell is not intended to be used as SpCell for carrier aggregation, do the

following:

2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to false.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows downlink carrier aggregation with three component

carriers across three Advanced RAN Coordination partners. The Advanced RAN

Coordination partners - gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules - are connected by an E5 link

through Advanced RAN Coordination.

Aggregation across three Advanced RAN Coordination partners allows more efficient use

of the scattered spectrum.

Capacity and Performance

Cell utilization is expected to improve because downlink data transmission is

distributed across multiple component carriers.
