# 1 NR Radio Resource Partitioning Overview

The feature ensures that resource partitions get prioritized access to PRBs

corresponding to the resource shares configured in the resource allocation

policy.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Monitors resource use for each resource partition and ensures that shares for resource partitions are maintained during high load
- Prevents the overuse of radio resources in one resource partition to uphold the SLA for other resource partitions
- Introduces the observability of resource use for each configured partition in a cell
- Compensates for reduced PDSCH and PUSCH resources by adjusting RRP partition share

Hardware

Using PIM cancellation and PIM avoidance in HWAC radios reduces PDSCH resources.

The

reduction can be compensated by setting the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.sharedAdjustmentModeDl attribute to

GENERAL\_COMPENSATION.

Limitations

The feature is only supported in Low-Band and Mid-Band frequencies.

Network Requirements

The 5GC must support the configuration of different S-NSSAI for different PDU

sessions. Otherwise, partitioning is not possible based on S-NSSAI.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Radio Resource Partitioning

The feature enables prioritized use of a configured share of radio resources. This

way, the feature avoids that overuse of radio resources in one resource partition breaks

service level specification for another resource partition.

Resource partitions are collections of PDU sessions that are defined by PLMN, S-NSSAI, or

both. Resource shares can be assigned to a resource partition by creating a partition

mapping that connects a resource allocation policy to the resource partition. Resource

allocation policies are configured on cell level and a resource partition can have

different resource shares in different cells.

Any traffic that does not match any resource partition is served as residual traffic

without any prioritized share of resources.

Operational Flow of NR Radio Resource Partitioning

Figure 1   Operational Flow of NR Radio Resource Partitioning

1. The feature monitors and updates the spectrum resource use for each configured partition. Only DRBs are subject to partitioning. Traffic from SRBs is exempted from radio resource partitioning to prevent the loss of signaling messages.
2. The feature provides the required share of resources for the following traffic types with higher scheduling order according to the configured QoS priorities:
    - User plane traffic from all partitions that do not fully use their configured share of prioritized resources
    - Traffic that is configured as prioritized Note: Emergency calls are always treated as prioritized traffic regardless of the configured QoS priorities.
3. The remaining resources are used by the following traffic types with lower scheduling order: Traffic that has exceeded its configured share and that is configured as DEMOTED\_NORMAL Traffic with no partition configuredNote: The scheduling in this traffic type follows the configured QoS priorities.
4. Traffic that has exceeded its configured share and that is configured as DEMOTED\_LOW is handled at the lowest priority.

In case of PDSCH, PUSCH, or both PDSCH and PUSCH resource reduction, the feature

compensates for the loss, depending on the value set for the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.shareAdjustmentModeDl and

ResourceAllocationPolicy.shareAdjustmentModeUl attributes.

For both dynamic and static resource reduction, setting the value of the attributes

to GENERAL\_COMPENSATION reduces the degradation of available

resources and helps with resource availability for partitions with small or no

shares. If the value of the attributes is set to ABSOLUTE, the

benefits can be observed only in the case of static resource reduction.

## 3.1 Selection of Partition for DRB

When a DRB is set up, the feature assigns it to a resource partition.

Figure 2   Selection of Partition for DRB

If the feature is not configured, radio resource partitioning is not applied.

If the EN-DC RAN Slicing feature is not configured, all EN-DC

traffic is classified as residual traffic.

Carrier aggregation SCell traffic is mapped to the carrier aggregation partition if

carrier aggregation partition is configured. Otherwise, carrier aggregation SCell

traffic is classified as residual traffic.

If the resource partition does not exist with a resource partition member with matching

PLMN ID and S-NSSAI combination, it is classified as residual traffic.

If a partition mapping exists with a configured priority 5QI that matches the 5QI for the

DRB, DRB is handled as prioritized traffic that is exempted from radio resource

partitioning.

If the resource allocation policy has a service policy with a configured 5QI that matches

the 5QI for the DRB, the matching configured service policy is used for the resource

partition. If the resource allocation policy has no service policy with any configured

5QIs that match the 5QI for the DRB, the resource allocation policy is used.

## 3.2 Scheduling

The feature handles the enforcement of radio resource partitioning through the

scheduling priority in conjunction with the regular QoS configuration.

| Prioritized              | Traffic that is configured as prioritized.                                                                                                            | ELEVATED           |

| Deprioritized            | User plane traffic for which the resource use is above the configured                                 share and that is configured as DEMOTED_NORMAL. | DEMOTED_NORMAL     |
| Deprioritized            | User plane traffic for which the resource use is above the configured                                 share and that is configured as DEMOTED_LOW.    | DEMOTED_LOW        |
| CA Traffic               | User plane traffic for which the resource use is below the configured                                 CA share.                                       | ELEVATED           |
| CA Traffic               | User plane traffic for which the resource use is above the configured                                 CA share.                                       | DEMOTED_NORMAL     |

The traffic within each classification category follows the configured QoS

priorities.

Bearers in one partition are scheduled by QoS in relation to bearers in the same

partition. This prevents lower QoS users in one partition from being suppressed by

higher QoS users in another partition. Available resources are shared among all traffic

based on the regular QoS configuration, while ensuring that each partition can use their

configured share when required.

All UEs that belong to a resource partition have prioritized access to the configured

share of the resources. The allocation of resources in the resource partition is based

on the UE scheduling weight.

# 6 Performance of NR Radio Resource Partitioning

The feature introduces counters and events related to resource partitions. It can

also affect KPIs depending on the partition resource demands.

KPIs

This feature might have a negative impact on KPIs if the resource demands on a

partition exceed the configured share.

Counters

The feature introduces the

GNBDUFunction.pmFwkSampLostL2Cellpartition PM counter.

The feature introduces the following EBS counters:

- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlCaScellPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlPriorityPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlResidualPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlPriorityPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlResidualPartitionDistr

The feature introduces the following EBS flexible counters:

- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlPartitionDistr

These flexible counters can be used to observe the performance of the feature

with the partitionId and serviceId filters

applied.

If filtering on these flexible counters using

serviceId without including partitionId,

and the serviceId is unique for that cell, it

results

the resource utilization distribution values for that

serviceId.

If filtering on these flexible counters using partitionId

without including serviceId, and there are no underlying

Service Policies, it results the resource utilization distribution values for that

partitionId.

If filtering on these flexible counters using partitionId

without including serviceId, and there are underlying Service

Policies, it results all the resource utilization distribution values reported for

that partitionId.

For information on the EBS counters and flexible counters, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

The feature introduces the duPerCellpartitionResourceRep PM

event.

The duPerCellResourceRep PM event is updated to contain the cell

resource use report for each cell.

# 7 Activate NR Radio Resource Partitioning

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012559 MO instance.
2. Set the NRCellDU.nrRrpEnabled attribute to true. It is possible to enable radio resource partitioning in NR for only the desired cells.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR Radio Resource Partitioning

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.nrRrpEnabled attribute to false. If radio resource partitioning in NR must remain enabled in certain cells, no feature deactivation is required, as it is possible to disable radio resource partitioning in NR for only the desired cells. Note: If the attribute is set to true while the feature is deactivated, the cell will be disabled after the node is restarted or the cell is unlocked.
2. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012559 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Radio Resource Partitioning

## 9.1 Configuring Radio Resource Policies

To use radio resource partitioning on an NR cell, the cell resource mapping for the

NRCellDU MO class must be configured.

Figure 4   MO Structure for NR Radio Resource Partitioning

The radio resource policies contain the following:

- Cell resource mapping with partition mapping that maps cells to resource allocation policies and resource partitions.
- Resource shares that are specified by the resource allocation policies.
- Service policies with resource shares for different services that can be configured based on 5QI filtering.

Groups of user plane traffic can be specified with a cell-specific share of downlink and

uplink spectrum resources by configuring the radio resource policy.

The expected loads for the affected traffic types and services must be considered during

the configuration of uplink and downlink spectrum shares in resource allocation and

service policies. In uplink traffic, the QoS must be configured so that the DRBs from

different partitions do not use the same LCG.

Resource partitions can be added, modified, or removed without locking and unlocking the

cell, as configuration changes take effect for new connections. If a resource partition

or a service policy is removed, the traffic in DRBs that are using that resource is

handled as residual traffic.

Resource policy

groups can be defined so that configured resources that are not utilized for traffic in

a partition are prioritized to be distributed to other partitions or services within the

same policy group.

5QI values that are not configured in the ServicePolicy MO

class             receive a resource share that equals the ResourceAllocationPolicy

share from which the configured ServicePolicy shares are

subtracted.

### 9.1.1 Configuring Partition Mappings

Partition mappings can be configured manually to assign resource shares to a resource

partition.

1. A CellResourceMapping MO instance must be created with a PartitionMapping MO instance. Up to 13 PartitionMapping MO instances can be created under a CellResourceMapping MO instance for an NR cell.
2. The NRCellDU.cellResourceMappingRef attribute must be set to point to the CellResourceMapping MO class.
3. A ResourceAllocationPolicy MO instance must be created.
4. The PartitionMapping.resourceAllocationPolicyRef attribute must be set to point to the ResourceAllocationPolicy MO class.
5. The PartitionMapping.listResourcePartitionRef attribute must be set to point to the ResourcePartition MO class.
6. The resource shares for the resource partition must be configured by using the ResourceAllocationPolicy.spectrumShareDl and the ResourceAllocationPolicy.spectrumShareUl attributes respectively.
7. The PartitionMapping.networkId attribute must be set to the same value in the PartitionMapping MO instances that point to the ResourceAllocationPolicy MO instances that belong to a policy group.
8. The CellResourceMapping.shareInheritance attribute must be set to HIERARCHICAL if there is any inheritance of configured resources that are not used for traffic in a partition within a policy group.

### 9.1.2 Configuring Service Policies

Service policies within a resource allocation policy can be configured

manually.

Service policies define specific services that have prioritized access to the shares of

resources within a resource partition. The service resources are expressed in percentage

of the total share for the resource partition. A service policy is configured by

creating a ServicePolicy MO instance under the

ResourceAllocationPolicy MO class. The services the policy

applies for are configured by using the

ServicePolicy.servicePolicy5qiList attribute. Resource shares for

the service policy are configured using the

ServicePolicy.spectrumShareDl and the

ServicePolicy.spectrumShareUl attributes.

### 9.1.3 Configuring Prioritized Services

Dedicated services in a resource partition can be configured as prioritized traffic

that are allowed to use the full spectrum bandwidth.

Prioritized services are configured through the 5QI values of the QoS flows by using the

PartitionMapping.priorityPartition5qiList attribute.

Example 1   Configuring VoNR as Prioritized Service

VoNR is strongly recommended to be configured as prioritized service by configuring

voice traffic to 5QI=1 and IMS signaling to 5QI=5, as prioritized traffic.

### 9.1.4 Configuring Dedicated Partitions for Carrier Aggregation SCell Traffic

Dedicated partitions for carrier aggregation SCell traffic must be configured

manually if needed.

Dedicated partitions for carrier aggregation SCell traffic can be configured by setting

the value of the PartitionMapping.caPartition attribute to

true.

## 9.2 Configuring the Balance between the Resource Distribution over Time and the Traffic Latency

The following attributes can be used to configure the balance between the distribution of

resources over time and the

latency

that is introduced to the traffic:

- For traffic mapped to a service policy: ServicePolicy.rrpOperationModeDl ServicePolicy.rrpOperationModeUl
- For traffic not mapped to a service policy: ResourceAllocationPolicy.rrpOperationModeDl ResourceAllocationPolicy.rrpOperationModeUl

## 9.3 Configuring the Over-Allocation of Resource Share Values in a Partition

The presence of service policies can result in the over-allocation of resource share

values in a resource partition.

The ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute can be

used to prevent the over-allocation of resource share values caused by the presence of

service policies.

The default value of the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute is set

to true to allow the over-allocation of resource shares. If the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute is set

to false, the resource shares of the configured service policies are

adjusted based on their priority not to exceed the resource shares for the resource

partition.

The service policy with the service ID value of 1 has the highest

priority, followed by the service policy with the service ID value of

2. If shares are still available in resource shares, the remaining

shares are used by the partition not configured for service policies.

The ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute affects

the following features:

- Automated Radio Resource Partitioning
- Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning
- NR Radio Resource Partitioning

The following example shows a possible configuration of the resource shares and the

service policies:

- ResourceAllocationPolicy.spectrumShareDl = 10
- ServicePolicy.spectrumShareDl = 70. ServicePolicy.serviceId = 1
- ServicePolicy.spectrumShareDl = 50. ServicePolicy.serviceId = 2

If the ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute is set

to false, the resource shares of the service policy with a service ID

value of 1 is seven shares. The service policy with a service ID value

of 2 is allocated the remaining three shares, not the originally

configured five shares.

## Appendix A.c: 25.Q1.0: Improved Adaptive RRP Share Adjustment

The feature enhancement improves RRP share adjustment by introducing different

adjustment modes.

| Feature Name           | NR Radio Resource Partitioning   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5337                     |
| Value Package Name     | Advanced RAN Slicing             |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                         |

Summary and Benefits

The share percentage of all the resources in the bandwidth determines the amount of

resources prioritized for partition when RRP is used. This method does not account

for slot-based available RB symbol resource variations. If the RRP configuration is

unbalanced, smaller partitions might be affected to a greater degree than larger

partitions if slot resource is reduced for PDSCH and PUSCH.

The feature enhancement allows the configuration of modes for resource share

adjustment, which can compensate for the reduction of the PDSCH and PUSCH resources

dynamically. This helps with maintaining the spectrum shares for partitions with

small or no shares.

The feature enhancement supports NR Standalone and EN-DC deployments in Low-Band and

Mid-Band.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement improves the reliability of distributing available resources

to partitions with priority in the cell.

The benefits of the feature enhancement can be monitored using the following EBS

counters:

- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlPriorityPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlPriorityPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlCaScellPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlResidualPartitionDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlResidualPartitionDistr

For more information on EBS counters associated with the

feature/enhancement/improvement, see Lists and Delta Lists.
