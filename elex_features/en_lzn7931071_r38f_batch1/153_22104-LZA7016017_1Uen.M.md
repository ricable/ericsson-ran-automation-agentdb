| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 							node. |

Summary

The feature allows the downlink outer loop adjustment to be disabled and introduces

SINR backoff in downlink link adaptation for the following levels:

- Cell
- Slot
- Modulation
- Rank

The feature provides observability for HARQ ACK/NACK in the downlink for initial

transmissions. This can be monitored on the cell level for each slot and each

modulation scheme.

The feature improves the cell and UE throughput in the downlink by tuning the SINR

backoff and disabling the outer loop adjustment where high downlink BLER is

observed.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature is not supported in High-Band cells.

The SINR backoff configuration and the disabling of the outer loop adjustment are not

applied to the downlink link adaptation in ESCells. PM events and PM counters are

not stepped with ESCell downlink HARQ feedbacks.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Slot-Specific Downlink Link Adaptation

The feature improves downlink link adaptation by providing means to adjust the SINR

in link adaptation and to disable outer loop adjustment per cell, per slot, per modulation,

and per rank

The feature helps monitor the HARQ ACK/NACK feedback. In case of high BLER, using the

members of the NRCellDU.slotSpecificDlLaConfigList MO attribute, the

operator can set specific configurations for link adaptation in the cells on slot,

modulation, and rank level. The configured downlink link adaptation can be monitored and

updated if needed.

Slot-Specific Downlink Link Adaptation Configuration

The following following members of the

NRCellDU.slotSpecificDlLaConfigList MO attribute set the

System Frame Number (SFN) and decide if the slot is the configured high-BLER

slot:

- sfnPeriodForLaConfig
- sfnOffsetForLaConfig
- slotForLaConfig

The members have no default values. For the configuration to take effect, the

operator must define the values.

Rank and Modulation List Configuration

The following members of the NRCellDU.slotSpecificDlLaConfigList

MO attribute set the rank and the modulation, and decide if one scheduled element is

the target scheduled element to apply the downlink link adaptation functions:

- rankEnabledList
- modulationEnabledList

The attribute members are both strings of length four, in which only 0 and 1 are

allowed. 0 means that the

outerLoopAdjustDisabled and sinrBackoff

attribute members are deactivated in the corresponding rank and modulation,

1 means that the parameters are activated.

The chars in the string of the rankEnabledList attribute member,

in the order of left-to-right, represent Rank1, Rank2, Rank3, and Rank4

respectively.

The chars in the string of the modulationEnabledList attribute

member, in the order of left-to-right, represent QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM

respectively.

There is no default value. For the configuration to take effect, the operator must

modify the values.

Disabling Outer Loop Adjustment

The outerLoopAdjustDisabled attribute member of the

NRCellDU.slotSpecificDlLaConfigList MO attribute decides

whether the outer loop adjustment is disabled or enabled. When the value is set to

TRUE, downlink outer loop adjustment is stopped in the

configured SFN, slot, rank, and modulation combination.

When the value is set to FALSE, if the HARQ feedback is

acknowledged, the outer loop is adjusted to increase. If the HARQ feedback is not

acknowledged, the outer loop is adjusted to decrease.

There is no default value. For the configuration to take effect, the operator must

modify the values.

Using SINR Backoff for Adjusting SINR Estimation

The sinrBackoff attribute member of the

NRCellDU.slotSpecificDlLaConfigList MO attribute decides the

SINR backoff value-added to the outer loop in the configured SFN, slot, rank,

modulation combination. The attribute member is used together with the estimated

SINR from the SINR measurement.

The SINR backoff only affects the initial transmission.

There is no default value. For the configuration to take effect, the operator must

modify the values.

Principles

When choosing the transport format for one UE, the configuration from the downlink

slot chosen for PDSCH transmission must be used.

When a downlink HARQ feedback is received, adjustment of the outer loop depends on

the configuration of the downlink slot in which PDSCH is transmitted.

The SINR backoff must be applied for each harqProcess, and the accumulated outer loop

adjustment must be applied for all bundled harqProcess.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Slot-Specific Downlink Link Adaptation

When downlink initial HARQ BLER varies between slots, SINR backoff and disabling of

the outer loop adjustment can be applied on the slot with high BLER.

Tuning the Feature

Tuning the feature improves cell and UE throughput when using the NR Slot-Specific

Downlink Link Adaptation feature to configure the SINR backoff and to disable the

downlink outer loop adjustment in the following cases:

- Specific slot cases
- Specific rank cases
- Specific modulation cases

Steps

1. Monitor feature-specific performance metrics without slot-specific downlink link adaptation configuration.
2. Identify the slot, or modulation with high BLER.
3. Set the slot-specific downlink link adaptation configuration.Note: It is recommended to start the configuration of the sinrBackoff member with a small value and to set the outerLoopAdjustDisabled value to TRUE.
4. Monitor the changes of the downlink throughput and the feature-specific performance metrics. Different sinrBackoff and outerLoopAdjustDisabled member combinations can be tried for best results.
5. Repeat the identification of the slot or modulation with high BLER and the setting of the slot-specific downlink link adaption configuration until the throughput improves and BLER is balanced between the slots.

Configuration Suggestions

It is not recommended that too many slots are configured for SINR backoff and the

disabling of outer loop adjustment. Only the slots with high BLER can be configured

with SINR backoff or the disabling of outer loop adjustment. It is suggested that

the same SINR backoff and disabling of outer loop adjustment members are used for

all ranks.

## 9.1 MOM Configuration Rules

Configuration of the NRCellDU.sfnOffsetForLaConfigList attribute

requires a set of rules and recommendations to follow to achieve proper system

functioning.

For the NRCellDU.sfnOffsetForLaConfigList attribute to work properly,

the following rules apply:

- The value of the sfnOffsetForLaConfig member must be less than the value of the sfnPeriodForLaConfig member in each instance of the configuration list.
- The slotForLaConfig member must be a downlink or a special slot.
- The rankEnabledList and the modulationEnabledList members are strings of 4 length bits. In the strings, only the values 1 and 0 are valid. Setting either of the strings to 0000 is not allowed.
- sinrBackoff = 0 and outerLoopAdjustDisabled = FALSE cannot exist in the same instance of the configuration list. In this case, the feature cannot be configured successfully.

### 9.1.1 Conflicting Cases

For a unique combination of the sfnPeriodForLaConfig,

sfnOffsetForLaConfig, and slotForLaConfig

members, only one configuration can be initialized.

Conflicts can be observed between the configurations in the following cases:

- When sfnPeriodForLaConfig equals 1 and slotForLaConfig equals -1, no other configuration is allowed in the configuration list attribute. All other configurations conflict with sfnPeriodForLaConfig = 1 and slotForLaConfig = -1, because this configuration enables the feature in all SFN and on all slots.
- When a configuration exists in the configuration list attribute where sfnPeriodForLaConfig equals 1, other configurations in the configuration list attribute cannot use the same slot setting.
- Table 7 Example of Conflicting Cases 1 Attribute Member Misconfiguration [1] sfnPeriodForLaConfig 1 sfnOffsetForLaConfig 0 slotForLaConfig -1
- When the slotForLaConfig member is set to -1, other configurations cannot use the same sfnPeriodForLaConfig and sfnOffsetForLaConfig values. In addition, configurations with the following relations cannot be used: sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [1] modulo sfnPeriodForLaConfig [2] = 0 sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [2] modulo sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [1] = 0 Table 8 Example of Conflicting Cases 2 Attribute Member Misconfiguration [1] [2] [3] sfnPeriodForLaConfig 2 8 1 sfnOffsetForLaConfig 1 1 0 slotForLaConfig -1 -1 4
- Configuration in the configuration list attribute cannot coexist if all the following criteria are met: sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [1] = sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [2] sfnOffsetForLaConfig from configuration [1] = sfnOffsetForLaConfig [2] sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [1] modulo sfnPeriodForLaConfig [2] = 0 or sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [2] modulo sfnPeriodForLaConfig from configuration [1] = 0
