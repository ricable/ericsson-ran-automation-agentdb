# 1 Hardware-Related Capabilities

Hardware-related capabilities enable or enhance the functionality of a node by adding

hardware-related features and capacities.

Access to hardware-related capabilities is provided through HWACs. HWAC keys are required

to enable or activate hardware-related capabilities as follows:

- Hardware-related features must be activated after the LKF is installed on the node. Features can be deactivated at any time.
- Hardware-related capacities are enabled automatically, when the LKF is installed.

The LKF contains license keys and HWAC keys that are requested for a specific node. This

means that each LKF is unique to the node, and each node can have only one valid LKF.

Each key entry in the LKF contains the following information:

- The ID of the key (for example, CXC4011022).
- The name of the feature or capacity.
- The value of the capacity.
- The associated validity period.

An LKF can be requested either manually or using Instantaneous Licensing. For information

on the Instantaneous Licensing solution, see Instantaneous Licensing. For information on

the Instantaneous Licensing use cases and procedures, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation

Codes.

## 1.1 Install License Key File on Baseband Products

Prerequisites

- The LKF is available for installation. The path to the LKF is defined in the RBS Summary File, as described in Manage Configuration Files.
- The date and time settings of the system clock in the node are correct. If the settings are incorrect, the LKF can be rejected by the node during installation.
- The fingerprint of the node is configured. The fingerprint is permanent, and it cannot be changed after the first successful installation of the LKF. The fingerprint in the LKF must match the fingerprint of the node. If the fingerprints do not match, the LKF is rejected.
- No other LKF installations are ongoing on the node.
- If the LKF is stored on an SFTP server, the password is required to access the server.
- The fail-safe backup function is activated. Some licenses or HWACs can cause O&amp;M connectivity failure, if their respective license key or HWAC key is missing from the LKF. If the fail-safe backup function is activated, the system can recover from the failure. The system performs the automatic restore from a backup, if the configuration is not confirmed within the predefined rollback period. For more information, see Manage Software.
- When the node runs in power saving mode,the capacity supported by the power saving mode can be exceeded if more HWAC capacity is required. For more information on Baseband Power Savings, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Steps

1. Run the installKeyFile (&lt;uri&gt;, &lt;password&gt;) action in the KeyFileManagement MO to start the installation. The URI specifies the location where the LKF is stored. The password parameter is required to access the location specified in the URI. The password parameter must always be provided, even if it is not a requirement to provide a password for the specified location. The progress of the installation can be monitored through the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.
2. Check the result in the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.

If the parameter is FAILURE, do the following:

3. Read and evaluate the resultInfo field of the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.

If the parameter is SUCCESS, do the following:

4. If needed, check that the correct LKF is installed by reading the KeyFileInformation.sequenceNumber MO.

Results

The Lm MO updates its MO structure to reflect the new LKF

information. For each entry in the LKF, the following changes are implemented:

- For every optional feature, FeatureState and FeatureKey are created. FeatureState.keyId and FeatureKey.keyId receive the value of the featureKey id from the LKF.
- For every capacity, CapacityState and CapacityKey are created. CapacityState.keyId and CapacityKey.keyId receive the value of the capacityKey id from the LKF.

The FeatureState.licenseState and

CapacityState.licenseState attribute becomes

ENABLED for each license key or HWAC key in the installed

LKF.

After This Task

Deactivate the fail-safe backup function.

## 1.2 Install License Key File on DU Products

Steps

1. Run the updateLicenseKeyFile (&lt;userId&gt;, &lt;password&gt;, &lt;ipAddress&gt;, &lt;sfile&gt;) action in the Licensing MO. The parameters in the updateLicenseKeyFile action are the following: userId The login ID to the FTP or SFTP server where the LKF is located. password The password of the server. ipAddress The domain name, IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server. sFile Source name and path of the LKF on the server.
2. Check the result on the Licensing.lastLicensingPiChange attribute to verify that the LKF is installed successfully. Note: If the installation is not successful, check the active alarms.

# 2 Hardware-Related Features

Hardware-related features enhance the functionality of hardware units in a

node.

Enabling a hardware-related feature requires a valid HWAC key in the LKF which is

installed on the node.

In the LKF, each HWAC key entry contains the following information about the

features:

- The featureKey id element is the identification of the HWAC key for the feature. This is a unique code for each feature.
- The description element contains the name of the feature.
- The start and stop elements indicate the beginning and the end of the validity period.

After the LKF is installed, the feature must be activated.

## 2.1 Activate Feature

Optional features and basic features with license or HWAC keys must be activated.

Capacities are activated automatically when the LKF is installed.

Prerequisites

- The fail-safe backup function is activated. Some licenses or HWACs can cause O&amp;M connectivity failure, if their respective license key or HWAC key is missing from the LKF. If the fail-safe backup function is activated, the system can recover from the failure. The system performs the automatic restore from a backup, if the configuration is not confirmed within the predefined rollback period. For more information, see Manage Software.

Steps

1. Ensure that the corresponding license key is installed by checking that the FeatureState.licenseState attribute for the feature is ENABLED.
2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute MO for the respective feature to ACTIVATED.

After This Task

Deactivate the fail-safe backup function.

## 2.2 Deactivate Feature

Optional features and basic features with license or HWAC keys can be deactivated.

Capacities do not need to be deactivated. If the license or HWAC key becomes invalid, or

expires, they are disabled automatically.

Prerequisites

The fail-safe backup function is activated.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute for the respective feature to DEACTIVATED.

After This Task

Deactivate the fail-safe backup function.

### 3.2.1 Radio Output Power Limitations

Radio output power capability can be limited and backed off. When the power level is

seamlessly increased or decreased, interruption times can occur.

The main reasons for radio output power limitations are the following:

- High temperature and hardware protection
- Not exceeding regulatory requirements
- Radio unit filter attenuation at band edge
- Insufficient input power to radio units

When insufficient input power to radio units is detected, the RF output power is

gracefully backed-off. During graceful back-off, the node maintains the coverage for the

affected cell or cells by decreasing the maximum traffic and performing a power

boost.

## 3.3 List of Baseband Utility Modules and Utilization Packages

Utility modules enable the basic or extended hardware functionality of Baseband

units.

Each Baseband unit requires exactly one initial module to function. The installation

of multiple initial modules is not supported. The type of the initial module

determines the type of capacity enabled on the Baseband unit. Baseband utility

modules exist in the following types and subtypes:

- Throughput, measured in Mbps
- Spectrum, with one of the following subtypes: Antenna bandwidth (ABW), measured in MHz For Remote radio units. Massive MIMO, which is a combination of configured carrier bandwidth (CBW), measured in MHz and the number of MIMO layers, measured in the number of layers. For Massive MIMO radio units.

(1)

The Cell Carrier (TRX) increases the number of cell carriers in a

sector.

(2)

The Number of Cell Carriers extends the licensed number of cell

carriers in a configured cell.

(3)

The Configurable Vertical BeamWidth HWAC enables different signal

coverage by switching between narrow vertical beam and wide

vertical beam.

(4)

The pmLic50MHzBwHwac PM counter reports the

current number of 50 MHz HWACs allocated to sector carriers in

the node.

# 4 NR mmWave EIRP 1 dB Step

The NR mmWave EIRP 1 dB Step output power HWAC is available in 1 dB steps, and

multiple HWAC instances are used to reach the required level. By default, aggregated EIRP of

47 dBm is available for each radio for one or more carriers.

EIRP is the strongest equivalent output power of the carrier that is used by an

Massive MIMO radio unit. It is available in the direction with maximum antenna gain.

If the radio has more than one carrier, aggregated EIRP is used to calculate the

HWAC for the Massive MIMO radio units. The configurable EIRP values of the carriers,

and therefore the maximal useful number of HWAC steps, depend on the following

factors:

- Massive MIMO radio unit in use
- Frequency band in use
- Configuration mode in use

For more information, see the description of the specific radio unit.

## 4.1 Calculate NR mmWave EIRP 1 dB Step Output Power HWAC

The aggregated EIRP HWAC individual Massive MIMO radio units require is recommended

to be calculated with at least one decimal. This is to avoid rounding errors. The

calculation must be done in the following order:

Steps

1. Convert the EIRP value for each carrier from dBm to watt.
2. Add the values in watt together.
3. Convert the aggregated value from watt to dBm.

# 5 PIM Cancellation in Radio

The user is able to suppress in-line PIM in individual antenna ports with PIM

Cancellation in Radio.

PIM Cancellation in Radio is introduced with the

FAK

101 0161 product number and with the

CXC 401 2387 feature key. Once

HWAC license is required for each radio and each node to activate PIM Cancellation in

Radio.

PIM Cancellation in Radio protects uplink signals by suppressing third- and fifth-order

in-line PIM that is generated by downlink signals. Receiver sensitivity is affected if

PIM overlaps receiver signals in the spectrum. With PIM Cancellation in Radio, the

overlapping PIM is suppressed, which improves receiver sensitivity. PIM sources are

considered stable or non-linear. The characteristics of stable PIM sources vary because

of temperature and aging. Non-linear PIM sources have the following characteristics:

- No saturation of third-order and fifth-order intermodulation products
- Third-order intermodulation is stronger than fifth-order

PIM Cancellation in Radio provides the following benefits:

- Fewer site visits for PIM source cleaning
- Improved cell capacity
- Improved cell coverage
- Improved uplink KPIs for NR and LTE FDD radios
- Improved uplink throughput
- Mitigation of the receiver sensitivity degradation caused by PIM

For Multistandard Mixed Mode (MSMM) radio, the PIM Cancellation in Radio

HWAC license is allocated for each node and for each radio. It means that if a radio

unit is shared by two nodes, one HWAC license on each node is required to enable PIM

Cancellation in Radio on the specific node. In total, it requires two HWAC licenses to

enable PIM Cancellation in Radio on all carriers on both nodes If multiple nodes are

connected to the same radio unit, each node has uplink victim cells that need a HWAC

license. The nodes only have aggressor cells that do not require a license to support

the PIM Cancellation in Radio.

## 5.7 PIM Cancellation in Radio Related Alarms

During the configuration of PIM Cancellation in Radio, the following alarms can be

raised:

- The MO Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the Key alarm indicates the shortage of PIM Cancellation in Radio HWAC licenses. PIM Cancellation in Radio configuration requires one HWAC license for each radio and each node.
- The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm indicates that the radio is not supported for PIM Cancellation in Radio.
- The HW Partial Fault alarm indicates a hardware fault in internal connectivity that disables PIM cancellation. If PIM overlaps with receiver signals in the spectrum, disabled PIM cancellation might affect KPIs.
