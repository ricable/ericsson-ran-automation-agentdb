# 2 Dimensioning Concept

The mobile transport network is used for carrying mobile service traffic. Dimensioning mobile transport depends heavily on the RAN requirements. From a dimensioning point of view, the most important requirement is cell throughput.

Dimensioning the network, such as the radio network and the transport network, is essential to ensure that the expected quality is achieved for end-users without excessive transmission costs for the operator.

The transport network dimensioning follows the radio network dimensioning activity, as well as the capacity licensing activity, so the activities are interdependent. In addition, some assumptions are made based on the outcome from the network analysis and simulations. It is important to clarify that dimensioning can be seen as a continuous process, composed of the following separate phases:

- pre-launch phase: Usually performed before the network is put into operation and any time a major change is expected. It is basically part of the standard design project.
- post-launch phase: Performed while the network is running in order to check if the pre-launch dimensioning is still valid, and to ensure that the necessary expansions are performed in due time. It is basically part of the traditional optimization phase (dimensioning review).

This guideline document focuses on the pre-launch phase.

## 2.1 Terminology and Concepts

This section lists the terminology and concepts related to this document.

Below figure shows the definitions of cell throughput variants and the busy hour.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 1   Cell Throughput Parameters

- Busy hour: 60-minute period during which the network experiences the maximum total traffic load in a given 24-hour period.
- Busy hour displacement dimensioning factor: Displacement that allows the transport network to take advantage of the aggregation. Most the Radio Nodes do not have busy hour at the same time as the system, or the core network busy hour. The displacement factor is represented by the percentage of Radio Nodes that do not have busy hour during the network busy hour. The busy hour displacement dimensioning factor is to be used with care. It should only be used higher up in the backhaul close to the 5G EPC or 5G Core. It should not be used with the traffic model method if it is an average traffic model defined for all NR RANs.
- Cell busy hour average throughput: The average throughput rate during the busy hour. It is referred to as Mean Cell Throughput in this document. It depends on spectrum bandwidth and average spectral efficiency.
- Cell maximum throughput rate in a loaded network: The cell maximum throughput rate in a loaded network represents the maximum traffic throughput that can occur within a short time period, for example a few seconds to a few minutes.
- Cell peak throughput rate in an unloaded network: The cell peak throughput rate in an unloaded network is the cell maximum throughput rate in ideal conditions. For example, this can be a single user close to the cell antenna. It is referred to as Cell Peak Rate in this document.
- Cell throughput rate: The total traffic rate from each User Equipment (UE) that is connected to a single radio cell.
- Peak allocation: The maximum throughput capacity is the dimensioned link capacity, that is, the link is dimensioned for the maximum bitrate supported by the Radio Node configuration.
- Last mile: The transmission link that connects the cell site to the transport network. Usually it is a non-redundant link.
- Traffic aggregation: This is where all the traffic generated from all radio cells is aggregated. Following aggregation principles are used:
    - Statistical multiplexing gain: Most of the traffic is bursty and uncorrelated.
    - Busy hour displacement: All sites and different services do not have the same busy hour. For more information, see Busy hour displacement dimensioning factor.
- Multiple classes of service backhaul support: Ensures that traffic with delay objective is prioritized and meet the end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) goal.
- System based dimensioning: Dimensioning approach based on the statistical properties of the radio system, rather than on the offered traffic.
- Traffic model-based dimensioning: Dimensioning approach based on the subscriber traffic profile.

In NR, the supported multiple Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) numerologies are supported as listed in below table.

|   µ |   ΔF (kHz) |
|-----|------------|
|   0 |         15 |
|   1 |         30 |
|   2 |         60 |
|   3 |        120 |
|   4 |        240 |

The following frequencies and µ values are used:

- Low-Band frequencies below 6 GHz: µ = 0, ΔF = 15 kHz
- Mid-Band frequencies below 6 GHz: µ = 1, ΔF = 30 kHz
- High-Band frequencies above 6 GHz: µ = 3, ΔF = 120 kHz

The number of PRBs for Low-Band, Mid-Band, and High-Band are shown in below tables.

|   µ |   SCS (kHz) |   5 MHz |   10 MHz |   15 MHz |   20 MHz |   25 MHz |   30 MHz |   40 MHz |   50 MHz |

## 2.2 Dimensioning Methods

The following dimensioning methods can be used with own properties:

- Peak Allocation
- Traffic model
- System model

### 2.2.1 Peak Allocation

Peak allocation provides enough capacity to support the highest possible capacity demand.

Properties:

- No need for traffic model
- No need for measurement
- No QoS or GoS problem

Peak rates can be derived from the following:

- Node element capacity
- Licensed capacity

Peak allocation is used for cell site dimensioning. The peak rate concept is also used as target peak rate in both system model based and traffic model-based dimensioning.

### 2.2.2 Traffic Model

Traffic model-based dimensioning determines the capacity using the traffic profile in the network. The traffic profile can be derived from the traffic types, such as voice, data, and Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). It can also be derived from subscriber data contracts, that is x GB/month/UE.

While the traffic model is more cost-effective and precise than the system model, it is hard to find an accurate and common traffic profile during the network planning phase.

Note: If an accurate traffic profile is available, traffic model-based dimensioning is recommended.

### 2.2.3 System Model

The system model is based on network system characteristics, such as spectrum bandwidth and product parameters. It ensures best performance of an E2E mobile service.

In practice, for dimensioning, it is easier to obtain system characteristics than traffic types and subscriber data contracts.

Note: In general cases, system model-based dimensioning is recommended.

### 2.2.4 Backhaul Transport Dimensioning Strategy

Different strategies for dimensioning of the backhaul can be used based on the requirements for cost and RAN performance. By selecting a more aggressive approach for traffic aggregation on backhaul links, cost savings can be achieved on the transport network. However, too much traffic aggregation can result in congestion in the transport link. If RAN performance is important, the dimensioning strategy aims for a transport dimensioning based on expected eNodeB and gNodeB throughput. This typically leads to an over-dimensioned transport network. The dimensioning strategies are described below.

Note: Regardless of what strategy is selected, possible future traffic growth always has to be considered.

#### 2.2.4.1 Focus on RAN Performance Strategy

This strategy aimed for good E2E performance, suitable for the following scenarios,

- Selling premium subscriptions.
- Important sites.
- If transport cost is not an issue, afford larger transport bandwidths.
- High volume sites.
- The transport network has to adapt to the predicted system peak throughput.
- Select the System Model method.

#### 2.2.4.2 Focus on Cost Strategy

This strategy aimed for building a cost-efficient network, suitable for the following scenarios,

- Selling low-cost subscriptions.
- Links with large transport costs.
- Rural area sites, with long transport distance and lower traffic load.
- If RAN performance is not a critical issue, as it can result in congestion if the traffic exceeds the predicted traffic. High risk for congestion need to be considered, if the traffic exceeds the predicted traffic.
- The transport network has to adapt to the predicted traffic model.
    - The user target peak throughput rate for certain numbers of eNodeB units and gNodeB units is guaranteed in the traffic model method. The traffic model method assumes significant trust in the traffic model. If the traffic is more than the predicted traffic, it can result in service degradation in the transport link. Service degradation in the S1/X2 and the NG/Xn interface traffic can be observed through increased delay or lost packet frames.
- Select the Traffic Model method.

Most likely a mix of these strategies is used in one network. For example, most sites in urban areas require good RAN performance. For rural areas where most sites are dimensioned for coverage, it is recommended to build a transport cost efficient network to minimize costs.

Links closer to the eNodeB units and gNodeB units are dimensioned to support the target peak rate. However, links higher up in the transport network support the predicted amount of traffic. The predicted traffic can be based on live network measurement data, or marketing department information.

### 2.2.5 Transport Overheads

When the UE traffic is carried in the backhaul network, it is encapsulated with transport protocol overhead. Below figure shows the transport protocol overview of the user plane traffic.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 2   Transport Protocol Overview of User Plane Traffic

The physical layer is based on media type, such as fiber, copper, or microwave. The most common transport protocol is Internet Protocol (IP) over Ethernet. In cases where Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) is deployed, one or more MPLS labels are added between IP and Ethernet. In cases where Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used, the communication is to be secured in an untrusted Mobile Backhaul (MBH) network and additional overhead is added. For this, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-based IPsec is recommended.

In addition to the protocol overheads, for non-ideal buffer use and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) burstiness cases, the transmission efficiency must also be considered. This guideline uses 95% as an estimated value.

Below table shows a summary of overhead costs in typical network cases.

| Protocol Overhead                                 | IPv4 (Octets)   | IPv4 with MPLS (Octets)   | IPv4 with IPsec (Octets)   | IPv6 (Octets)   | IPv6 with MPLS (Octets)   | IPv6 with IPsec (Octets)   |

Note(1): AES-CBC SHA2 algorithm

Note: For 5GC, the SDAP adds 1 Byte to the total overhead (O). This does not change the Transport Overhead Factor.

The total transport overhead factor must be multiplied by the radio data payload to calculate the transport capacity requirement.

## 2.3 Downlink and Uplink Capacity

Downlink refers to the traffic direction from the core network to the UE. Uplink refers to the traffic direction from the UE to the core network. Downlink throughput is usually larger than uplink throughput.

Certain new use cases, such as sharing live video, consume more uplink capacity than others. Emerging 5G use cases, such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, also use higher uplink capacity. In these cases, uplink dimensioning must be done more carefully, but overall, uplink traffic is still smaller than downlink traffic.

Given that the current mobile transport network is Ethernet-based, the capacity of the transport physical link is bidirectionally symmetrical. This means that if the capacity is dimensioned sufficiently for downlink traffic, it will also be sufficient for uplink traffic.

Consequently, this guideline focuses on downlink dimensioning.

## 2.4 Network Reference Model

Mobile transport networks carry mobile traffic for the fronthaul and the backhaul networks.

Below figure shows a typical mobile transport network.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 3   E2E Mobile Transport Network

The fronthaul interface consists of either of the following interfaces:

- Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI)
- enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI)

The backhaul network, connecting to core applications through the Baseband unit, consists of the following parts:

- Cell Site Router (CSR)
- Access network
- Aggregation network

Baseband units communicate using the E5 interface when running elastic RAN applications in the LTE-Advanced network.

Radio spectrum bands vary based on regulations in different countries. Operators choose Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) or Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode based on the available spectrum resources. FDD and TDD impact dimensioning work differently, with the biggest difference being the downlink spectrum resource. In FDD mode, the downlink spectrum is considered only because of the symmetric spectrum band. In TDD mode, the spectrum resource is configured with more flexible proportions for downlink and uplink bandwidth allocation. This document gives a common formula for capacity dimensioning in both FDD and TDD modes.

## 2.5 System Model-Based Dimensioning

System model-based dimensioning uses peak allocation method and traffic aggregation method.

With the peak allocation method, link capacity dimensioning is determined by the maximum system output. It considers both the cell peak rate and the maximum throughput of the Radio Base Station (RBS) site.

With the traffic aggregation method, link capacity dimensioning is determined by the aggregated cell throughput. The aggregation of traffic on each cell forms a simple and useful traffic model with an aggregation factor. This is true even without individual subscriber traffic profiles for the following reasons:

- Most cell traffic bursts are not correlated, so peak rate on each cell happens at different times in a 24-hour period.
- If there is a network collision, E2E Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees the latency objective in mobile transport networks. Most of the cell traffic is elastic, with buffering allowed. The buffer is used to make non-constant data traffic streams steady.

Network dimensioning focuses on the following objectives:

- Ensuring that the cell peak rate is achieved.
- Ensuring that the E2E mobile service performance meets Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Optimizing transport link utilization.

Cell peak rate is limited by network system characteristics, such as the hardware and software used. The operator can also limit cell peak rate on purpose, even if the system allows a higher rate.

E2E mobile service performance is key to the end-user experience. Network dimensioning has to guarantee KPIs, such as bandwidth, to end users.

Transport link utilization is optimal, if it reduces Operating Expenditure (OPEX) as much as possible while providing high network performance.

Based on the different objectives, different dimensioning methods are recommended for different parts of the network. Below figure shows the recommended dimensioning methods.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 4   System Model-Based Dimensioning Method

The link points are defined as below:

| Link   | Description                                                  | Traffic Type         |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Link A | Backhaul link between Baseband and the CSR.                  | X2 and S1, Xn and NG |
| Link B | Backhaul link between the CSR and the access ring router.    | X2 and S1, Xn and NG |
| Link C | Backhaul ring links in the access network.                   | X2 and S1, Xn and NG |
| Link D | Backhaul ring links in the aggregation network.              | X2 and S1, Xn and NG |
| Link E | E5 link between Baseband units in an Elastic RAN case.       | Elastic RAN E5       |
| Link G | Fronthaul link between the radio unit and the Baseband unit. | CPRI and eCPRI       |

Note: The peak allocation method is recommended for link A, link B, link E, and link G. This is to avoid introducing a bottle neck for the radio resource, and reserve enough link capacity for good network performance.

Note: The traffic aggregation method is recommended for link C and link D to enable a cost-effective transport network design.

Note: For information about link E dimensioning, see NR Transport Dimensioning Examples. This guideline focuses on capacity dimensioning for link A, link B, link C, link D, and link G.

### 2.5.1 TDD Patterns Dimensioning Impact

LTE and NR can be used in both FDD and TDD mode. In FDD, separate frequency bands are used for uplink and downlink. In TDD, uplink and downlink are transmitted in the same frequency band. The resources in TDD are divided in time between the uplink and the downlink.

#### 2.5.1.1 LTE TDD

LTE supports 15 kHz subcarrier spacing, also called numerology. One subframe is 1 ms long (1 TTI). LTE TDD supports subframe configuration 1 (3DL:2UL) and subframe configuration 2 (4DL:1UL).

Figure 6   LTE Configuration 2 (4DL:1UL)

Both configuration 1 and configuration 2 support special subframe configuration 5, 6, and 7.

Figure 9   LTE Subframe Configuration 7 (10:2:2)

The TDD LTE subframes and special subframe configurations have a direct impact on the number of Resource Elements (REs) available for downlink and uplink user data. This will directly impact the achievable application layer throughputs of the network.

Below table shows the LTE TDD ratios for downlink and uplink.

| Configuration   | LTE Configuration 1 Subframe Configuration 5 (3:9:2)   | LTE Configuration 1 Subframe Configuration 6 (9:3:2)   | LTE Configuration 1 Subframe Configuration 7 (10:2:2)   | LTE Configuration 1 Subframe Configuration 5 (3:9:2)   | LTE Configuration 1 Subframe Configuration 6 (9:3:2)   | LTE Configuration 1 Subframe Configuration 7 (10:2:2)   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Downlink        | 44%                                                    | 53%                                                    | 54%                                                     | 64%                                                    | 73%                                                    | 74%                                                     |
| Uplink          | 43%                                                    | 43%                                                    | 43%                                                     | 23%                                                    | 23%                                                    | 23%                                                     |

If downlink traffic is higher than uplink traffic, subframe configuration 2 is recommended. If downlink and uplink traffic are equal, then subframe configuration 1 is recommended.

#### 2.5.1.2 NR TDD

TDD patterns have large flexibility. For more information, see 3GPP TS 38.212; NR; Multiplexing and Channel Coding.

For some NR deployments, there is a need to align with the current LTE network. In other cases, TDD patterns must be optimized for the specific needs of the NR network.

The guard band symbols in the special subframe slots affect the site-to-site distance when experiencing cross-link interference between gNodeB units.

NR Mid-Band supports 30-kHz subcarrier spacing, corresponding to 0.5 ms TTI. NR High-Band supports 120-kHz subcarrier spacing, corresponding to 0.125 ms TTI.

##### 2.5.1.2.1 NR Mid-Band Pattern Example

The NR TDD subframe and special subframe configurations have a direct impact on the number of REs available for downlink and uplink user data. This directly impacts the achievable application layer throughputs of the network. Below table shows the NR TDD ratios for downlink and uplink.

For more supported patterns and detailed information, see Control Channel Guideline NR.

The extension of cell coverage results in additional gap symbols between downlink and uplink. Because of this, the downlink throughput is reduced. For more information on the extended propagation delay support for High-band, see Network Impact Report NR.

### 2.5.2 Cell Peak Rate

#### 2.5.2.1 LTE Peak Rate Calculation

Cell peak rate is the maximum capacity of the air interface towards the UE in one cell. It is one of the most important considerations in network dimensioning.

Cell peak rate is calculated with the following simplified formula:

For FDD mode

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

For TDD mode

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where:

- BW: Spectrum bandwidth
- QAM factor: Gain from QAM technology, with the value 1 for 64 QAM and 1.3 for 256 QAM
- Layer: The number of MIMO layers
- Downlink portion: The portion of all resource elements used for downlink. (TDD only)

The constants 75 Mbps and 20 MHz are structuralized factors, derived from the LTE RAN radio physical layer setup. They vary slightly depending on the specific radio setup. Generally, if 20-MHz bandwidth is used in an LTE network without MIMO, the corresponding cell peak rate is 75 Mbps.

One LTE subframe is 1 ms and contains two slots. Each slot has seven symbols. Below figure shows the time-frequency grid for the LTE downlink physical resource.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 14   LTE Downlink Physical Resource, Time-Frequency Grid

For a 20-MHz LTE network, there are 100 resource blocks with 12 subcarriers each. Therefore the number of resource elements in one subframe is calculated in the following way:

2 slots × 7 symbols × 100 resource blocks × 12 subcarriers = 16,800 resource elements.

Basic LTE uses 64 QAM for modulation, where each resource element takes six bits (26 = 64).

This means that the total bit rate of the air interface is as follows:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Considering the about 25% overhead related to the control channel, the data peak rate is 100.8 Mbps × 75% = ~75 Mbps.

If 2x2 MIMO is used, the cell peak rate is doubled to 150 Mbps.

#### 2.5.2.2 NR Peak Rate Calculation

NR peak bit rates for a set of J NR component carriers can be estimated for the downlink or uplink using the following formula provided by 3GPP 38.306 V15:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where:

- aj: The scaling factor equals to the proportion of resources available for downlink or uplink. For FDD, α equals to 1.0. For TDD, see Control Channel Guideline NR.
- v(j)Layers: The number of layers for the the jth carrier.
- Q(j)m: The modulation order for the jth.
- f(j): A scaling factor given by the higher layer scaling Factor parameter taking on the following values:1.0, 0.8, 0.75, 0.4. This is used to reflect the capability mismatch between the UE and the NR system. It could be used, for example, where spectrum or hardware sharing limits the maximum achievable NR bitrate, if absent scaling factor 1 is applied.
- Rmax: The maximum data coding, its value equals to 948/1024.
- : The maximum number of resource blocks supported in the BW for the jth carrier with numerology µ. It is defined in 3GPP TS 38.101-1 and 3GPP TS 38.101-2. For more information on the number of PRBs for the Frequency Bands FR1 and FR2, see Control Channel Guideline NR.
![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)
- OH(j): The fraction of resource elements used for reference signals and signaling overheads for the jth carrier. In this guideline, this factor is not used.
- Ts(μ): The slot duration for the numerology µ [s] defined by the following formula:
![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)
- µ: The numerology, as defined in 3GPP TS 38.211. Note: This formula assumes that the channel conditions are sufficient for peak rates to be achieved, however, real-world cases might be different.

#### 2.5.2.3 System Constraints Due to Hardware, Software, or License
        Capacity

If the system is constrained by the hardware, software, or license capacity, the cell peak rate is limited with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where

- CellPeak: The calculated maximum capacity
- HWCapacity: Capacity limited by node hardware
- SWCapacity: Capacity limited by node software
- LicensedCapacity: Capacity limited by license

### 2.5.3 Mean Cell Throughput

Mean cell throughput is the average capacity of the cell during busy hour, where multiple UEs share the same air interface. Mean cell throughput is calculated with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where

- BW: The downlink bandwidth available in the spectrum
- AverageSpectrumEfficiency: The efficiency of the spectrum, measured in bits/s/Hz/cell

### 2.5.4 Aggregation Gain Factor

When using the traffic aggregation method in network dimensioning, the aggregation factor must be used correctly. The value depends on the dimensioning policy. If the operator does not have any constraints on the transport network, the aggregation factor value must be set to 1.

In this guideline, the aggregation factor value is 0.5 in the access network, and 0.8 in the aggregation network.

Note: The recommended aggregation factor values are based on simulation and verified in some deployment cases. The recommended aggregation factor values are applicable for Mobile Broadband (MBB) use. For other uses cases, such as FWA, they may vary.

### 2.5.5 MBH Dimensioning Formulas

Dimensioning formulas are given by RAN type. For multi standard site dimensioning, if the RANs are independent of each other, dimensioning has to meet the sum of all Radio Access Technology (RAT) requirements. If the RANs are dependent on each other, for example NR NSA, which must cooperate with LTE, a specific impact analysis is required. The impact analysis is described with the NR NSA dimensioning examples.

Note: The following formulas are based on a typical network setup. If the number or level of nodes changes, the formulas have to be adapted accordingly.

Link A Between Baseband and CSR

Link A dimensioning is calculated with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where

- TNOH: Transport overhead
- CellPeak: Cell peak rate
- nCell: Number of cells configured on Baseband node
- Mean: Mean cell throughput
- k: A factor used to get p percentile of the throughput distribution curve. In this guideline, p takes the value 90%, and k takes the value 1.28.
- Std: Standard deviation of the throughput distribution curve of one cell. Std = z x Mean, where z is in the range 0.6-1. In this guideline, z takes the value 0.6.

This formula ensures that cell peak rate can be reached on each cell in ideal conditions. It also ensures the normal performance of all cells in a real network.

Note: The above formula does not consider constraints such as hardware limits, software limits, or customer limits. If any constraint exists, CellPeak is to be replaced with CellPeakRate.

In ideal conditions, such as during a live demonstration, the user throughput can reach the cell peak rate. In a real network, the throughput is distributed between UEs in various radio conditions in the cell area.

Zero and maximum bit rates are unlikely to be observed in the real distribution of the cell throughput. If two or three cells are observed at the same time, the aggregated traffic throughput trend approaches a Gaussian distribution.

Below figure shows the Probability Density Function (PDF) of real, measured LTE cases.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 15   Throughput Distribution of One, Two, and Three Aggregated Cells, PDF

Three cells are sufficient to show normal distribution. The more cells are observed at the same time, the more the combined distribution approaches a Gaussian distribution. This is also applicable for link C and link D, which are between three or more cells.

The distribution of cell throughput depends on the mean cell throughput. It is not related to the sum of the cell peak rates of all cells.

While the throughput distribution of one cell with few users is not a normal distribution, aggregating the distribution for multiple users can be treated as a normal distribution. In this case, the standard deviation (std) is approximately the 60% of the average value (mean).

The average value and the standard distribution of the Gaussian distribution must be determined to calculate the capacity needed.

According to the convolution of Gaussian distribution, the throughput distribution of the n cells forms a new Gaussian distribution. It has the average value nCell × Mean, and the standard deviation is the follow formula expression:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Below figure shows the cumulative distribution function of three-cell throughput, the same case as in above figure.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 16   Throughput Distribution of Three Cells, Cumulative Distribution Function

With the cumulative distribution function, the throughput (x value) can be determined from the percentile (y value).

Note: It is recommended to ensure enough network capacity for 90% of the time. This provides a good balance between network cost and performance.

The quantile function of a distribution is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function. To ensure 90% throughput distribution under multiple cells, the value of k, which stands for quantile values, is 1.28. This is based on the following quantile function of a normal Gaussian distribution:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Therefore the link A dimensioning formula can be simplified in the following way:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Link B Between CSR and Access Ring Router

Link B dimensioning is calculated with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where

- CA: The capacity of link A, calculated with the link A dimensioning formula.
- Link B capacity: is the sum of all link A capacity in the network. The recommendation aims to eliminate capacity risk due to conflict in a small and busy location.

Link C of Access Ring

Link C refers to the access ring link, where each link section must have the same capacity. Link C dimensioning is calculated with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where

- TNOH: Transport network overhead
- mRBS: Number of RBSs connected to the access ring
- nCell: Number of cells configured for each RBS
- Mean: Mean throughput in a loaded network
- q: Aggregation gain factor, with the default value 0.5
- k: A factor used to get p percentile of the throughput distribution curve In this guideline, p takes the value 90% and k takes the value 1.28.
![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)
- Std: Standard deviation of the throughput distribution curve, Std = z x Mean. Where z is in the range 0.6 ~ 1. In this guideline, z takes the value 0.6.

Link D of Aggregation Ring

Link D refers to the aggregation ring link, where each link section must have the same capacity. Link D dimensioning is calculated with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Where

- CC: The capacity of the access network connected to the aggregation network
- q: Aggregation gain factor with the default value 0.8

### 2.5.6 Fronthaul Dimensioning

Fronthaul dimensioning refers to link G dimensioning, as shown in Figure 4.

Both CPRI and eCPRI dimensioning are introduced for the links between the following units:

- AIR units
- Baseband units
- Radio units

CPRI Link Dimensioning

CPRI is a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)-based interface. The number of CPRI links scales with carrier bandwidth and antenna branches. For information on calculating the number of CPRI links, see CPRI and eCPRI Capacity.

There are several CPRI link options supported, see below table.

| CPRI Option    |   CPRI Line Rate (Gbps) |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| CPRI option 3  |                     2.5 |
| CPRI option 5  |                     4.9 |
| CPRI option 7  |                     9.8 |
| CPRI option 8  |                    10.1 |
| CPRI option 10 |                    24.3 |

eCPRI Link Dimensioning

eCPRI is a packet-based interface. Unlike the CPRI link, which depends on the number of antenna branches, eCPRI link capacity scales with the number of MIMO layers. The number of MIMO layers represents real user traffic. eCPRI is valid for TDD massive MIMO products. Example eCPRI rates are: 10.3 Gbps and 25.8 Gbps. For information on calculating the number of eCPRI links, see CPRI and eCPRI Capacity.

For more information on Radio over Ethernet, CPRI, and eCPRI conversion dimensioning, see Ethernet Fronthaul Solution Guideline.

Fronthaul Sharing

Fronthaul sharing enables the 360-degree omni cell with two fibers connected to the site, three AIR units are cascading connected, each AIR unit has 120-degree coverage. Only one AIR unit can work at a time. For more information and details, see NR NSA Connectivity Guideline with Option 3x.

## 2.6 Traffic Model-Based Dimensioning

This section describes the traffic model dimensioning process. The calculations determine the bandwidth required for mobile backhaul.

Backhaul traffic is predominantly user data and to a lesser extent signaling traffic and OAM traffic. The required transport bandwidth is defined by the subscriber traffic model, as the total number of subscribers and amount of data per subscriber per month.

Primarily, the NR deployments are aiming to boost the traffic in hotspots. Therefore, the following types of traffic are expected: Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), and enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB).

### 2.6.1 5G QoS Identifier (5QI), QoS Class Identifier (QCI), and
      Traffic Classification

The most important QoS parameters for traffic are the packet loss rate, and the packet delay. The QoS requirements for different types of traffic define maximum acceptable packet loss rates and maximum acceptable packet delays.

If the amount of traffic sent over the backhaul exceeds the available link capacity for an extended time period, packets are lost. Queues in the transport network nodes can absorb temporary bursts of excessive traffic, but queuing introduces packet delays.

Traffic separation is a way to ensure that QoS requirements for different types of traffic are fulfilled. Each traffic type is mapped to a 5QI/QCI based on its QoS requirements. Traffic types with equivalent QoS requirements are mapped to the same 5QI/QCI. The different RAN QCIs are given different treatments. The different 5QI/QCIs are mapped to different outgoing queues. By scheduling the different queues with different priorities, it is ensured that traffic with strict requirements on delay and packet loss rates is given precedence over traffic with less strict requirements on delay and packet loss rates.

QoS separation is important, because it defines the desired use of the available bandwidth.

For more information on QoS separation, see E2E QoS Guideline.

### 2.6.2 Flow Behaviors

Based on behavior, traffic flows can be divided into the following main categories:

- Inelastic flows require a fixed data rate during the whole lifetime of the flows. To guarantee QoS requirements for these flows, the entire required bandwidth must be allocated on the link. An example of a service with inelastic flows is voice.
- Elastic flows can reduce their bandwidth demands when congestion occurs, but the length of the flows increase. An example of a service with elastic flows is non-guaranteed bit rate data transport.

These types of flows are shown in below figure.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 17   Inelastic and Elastic Flows

### 2.6.3 Grade of Service

The Grade of Service (GoS) is a measure on the availability of the transport service in the transport network. It is defined differently for GBR and non-GBR bearers:

- For GBR bearers, the GoS is the blocking probability, that is, the probability that the flow is rejected or granted.
- For non-GBR, bearers the GoS is the achieved average throughput of the flow, that is, the amount of transferred data divided by the length of the flow.

The wanted GoS is an input to dimensioning of the backhaul.

### 2.6.4 Dimensioning Formulas and Methods

Peak Allocation

Peak Allocation (PA) means, that enough capacity is provisioned to support the highest possible bandwidth demand. A link is dimensioned to carry the theoretical maximum throughput. Since it is unlikely, that data is sent at maximum speed from all cells at the same time, a reasonable maximum throughput is used.

Elastic Traffic Dimensioning

Assuming there are elastic flows with different Class of Service (CoS) values, the following inputs are used to dimension a link for elastic traffic:

- Sum of the offered average loads, or bit rates for the different flow types.
- The highest target average throughput among the different flow types.

The approximate capacity of the elastic traffic, marked as Ce, is then calculated with the following formula:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Kaufman-Roberts Formula

The Kaufman-Roberts (KR) formula is an extension of the Erlang B formula. The Erlang B formula is used to calculate the link capacity needed to get a certain blocking probability for GBR bearers with a specific bandwidth. The KR formula is used when there are multiple types of GBR bearers with different bandwidths. In that case, the KR formula is used to calculate a link capacity that ensures given blocking probabilities for each type of GBR bearer.

The following input is used for the KR formula:

- Offered load in Erlang for each traffic class
- Target Grade of Service (GoS) value, used as the target blocking probability for each type of GBR bearer
- The bandwidth demand for each type of GBR bearer

The KR formula can be extended with an additional requirement on the remaining bandwidth for non GBR bearers by adding the following variables:

- Bandwidth corresponding to the required remaining bandwidth for non-GBR bearers
- Traffic class bearer with zero offered load

The target GoS reflects bandwidth availability for non-GBR bearers. For example, a target GoS of 10% means that the remaining bandwidth is available 90% of the time. The extended KR formula is referred to as KR Remaining in this document.

Target Peak Rate and Target Peak

It is important to ensure the maximum peak rate during optimal conditions, for example a single user at an RBS and optimal radio conditions. The transport network is then dimensioned to ensure the highest peak rate transport among all types of bearers, the Target Peak Rate. Target Peak cannot be higher than what the radio equipment can support, due to the following limitations:

- Hardware
- Licensing
- Software

The traffic model has to provide information about the expected rates of GBR and non-GBR traffic. CoS separation is necessary to ensure the available bandwidth is used to fulfill the QoS requirements.

The following actions can be performed to use a traffic model method:

- Using the formula for elastic traffic dimensioning to calculate the bandwidth needed for non GBR traffic (Ce). The input is provided by the traffic model and target average flows. The sum of AverageRateFlows is the sum of all types of non-GBR traffic for the Baseband Radio Node. HighestTargetAverage is the highest target average throughput among the different types of non-GBR traffic flows. Note: If the relative amount of GBR traffic is low, then it can be enough to handle the GBR traffic same as the elastic flow type. The sum of average rate of flows include the GBR traffic as well.
- The following bandwidth requirements are added to get the total bandwidth for non-GBR traffic (CnonGBR):
    - OAM traffic
    - Signaling
    - Synchronization over IP (SoIP) The SoIP, Signaling and OAM bandwidth requirements are negligible compared to the packet data traffic. Therefore the formula can be simplified to the following form:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)
- The KR formula is used to calculate the bandwidth needed for GBR traffic, shown as CGBR in the following formula:
![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)
- The bandwidth needed for GBR and non-GBR traffic, equaling the total bandwidth needed for all traffic classes, can be calculated using the following formula: To ensure the highest target peak rate for the transport of different traffic types, dimensioning the last mile to the maximum of the bandwidths is needed for both GBR and non-GBR traffic. The last mile is dimensioned according to the following conditions: The transport network overhead must also be considered by multiplying with the Transport Network Overhead (TNOH) factor as shown in the following formula: The following generic formula considers aggregated traffic for the traffic model: NPeak is the number of eNodeB units and gNodeB units where one user is at target peak simultaneously. A rule of thumb is that about 10% peak at the same time of the involved basebands on that aggregation level.
    - Highest target peak rate
    - Traffic model used

## 2.7 Carrier Aggregation

Carrier Aggregation increases user bandwidth by combining carriers, so that users experience higher peak rates in the network. Carrier Aggregation is also increasing the average cell user throughput by 5%-30%, and cell edge bit rate up to 60%.

The carriers on same or different frequency bands can be combined for both TDD and FDD for Carrier Aggregation.

The following types of Carrier Aggregation are supported:

- Intra-Node Carrier Aggregation: On a common Baseband unit, supported for both LTE and NR
- Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation: Over X2 between different Baseband units, supported for LTE
- Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation: Over E5 between different Baseband units, supported for LTE
- Advanced RAN Coordination Carrier Aggregation: Over E5 between different Baseband units, supported for NR
- Intra-gNodeB Inter-Capacity Module Carrier Aggregation: Over E5L link between different capacity modules in the same gNodeB

The downlink peak throughput depends on the number of Component Carriers in duplex mode configuration and the type of Carrier Aggregation deployment (Intra-eNodeB, Inter-eNodeB, or Elastic RAN).

The following cases are not described in this guideline:

- Transport Network Aggregation for LTE Carrier Aggregation
- Uplink Carrier Aggregation
- Uplink CoMP (see Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline and Advanced RAN Coordination)
- Supplemental Downlink for Carrier Aggregation

### 2.7.1 LTE Intra-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

The 7CC Downlink Carrier Aggregation Extension feature supports duplex mode TDD or a mix of FDD and TDD (with FDD as a PCell) with up to 20 MHz carrier and a maximum of 20 MIMO layers.

Below figure shows the Intra-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation with a common shared Baseband unit.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 18   Intra-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

To calculate the cell peak rate, the same approach and formula is used as in Cell Peak Rate:

- For FDD mode

- For TDD mode
![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

The S1 cell site capacity is equal to the sum of all carrier components.

### 2.7.2 LTE Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation can be deployed in the following ways:

- In a different macro grid for different carriers

Below figure shows that inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation is achieved over multiple Baseband units through the X2 interface.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 22   Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

There are networks where both intra-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation and inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation are present.

The prerequisites for inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation are the following:

- For one-way X2 latency, a maximum value of 9 ms (a value less than 5 ms is recommended)
- Time and phase synchronization

The usual traffic division for both end-RBS and aggregation hubs is the following:

- 90% is intra-eNodeB CA traffic
- 10% is inter-eNodeB CA traffic

Aggregation is not a part of this guideline, however, the same approach described in MBH Dimensioning Formulas for applying the aggregation factors can be used (for example, 50% for link C and 80% for link D according to Figure 4). The additional 10% for inter-eNodeB X2 traffic must be added accordingly.

### 2.7.3 LTE Inter-eNodeB, Last Mile (End-RBS)

Transport capacity must be assured for non-Carrier Aggregation users. The same approach as for Intra-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation is used to calculate the last mile transport capacity.

Below figure shows traffic on the last mile between the following parts of network:

- Cell Site Router (CSR)
- eNodeB units
- Rest of the network

- For TDD mode:
![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

The S1 cell site capacity equals the sum of all carrier components. For Carrier Aggregation traffic, the same approach can be used.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Last mile transport capacity equals the higher value from non-Carrier Aggregation peak rate and non-Carrier Aggregation peak rate.

### 2.7.4 LTE Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation with E5 Link

In Inter-eNodeB E5 link Carrier Aggregation (CA), different eNodeB units are connected through E5 Link. The eNodeB units can be interconnected by direct cable or E-RAN switch.

Below figure shows the direct cable CA connection.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Below figure shows the E-RAN switch CA connection. IDLe or TN port can be used for E-RAN CA traffic

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 25   Inter-eNodeB CA with E-RAN Switch

The maximum Round Trip Time (RTT) latency for LTE E5 Link Carrier Aggregation (CA) is 160 µs, no throughput degradation is expected within the latency scope. The TDD and FDD Cell Peak formulas can be applied in the LTE E5 Link CA cases.

Note: Both TN and IDLe ports can be used for LTE E5 Link CA traffic, above two figures only show IDLe port for simplicity. For detailed configurations of inter-eNodeB E5 CA, see Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline.

### 2.7.5 NR Intra-gNodeB Carrier Aggregation

NR Carrier Aggregation is supported in both High-Band and Mid-Band. In both cases, the carriers are managed by one common Baseband unit.

NR intra-gNodeB Carrier Aggregation is similar to LTE intra-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation. The required transport capacity for a single carrier is the following:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

J is the number of aggregated carriers.

The total transport cell site capacity for NR NSA is equal to the sum of all carrier components for the traffic of the S1 interface.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

The total transport cell site capacity for NR SA is equal to the sum of all carrier comments for the traffic of the NG interface:

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

### 2.7.6 NR Intra-gNodeB Carrier Aggregation with E5 Link

In Intra-gNodeB E5 Link Carrier Aggregation, the E5L protocol is used to interconnect different capacity modules within the Baseband unit. No connections use the E5H protocol. In this case, the maximum Round Trip Time (RTT) latency is 900 µs.

The formulas used for NR Intra-gNodeB Carrier Aggregation can be used for the E5 Link Carrier Aggregation. No throughput degradation is expected within the latency 0-900 µs. For more information on E5, see Advanced RAN Coordination

Below figure shows the general configuration of NR E5 Link Carrier Aggregation.

## 2.8 Elastic RAN Dimensioning

### 2.8.1 E-RAN Deployment Strategy

The amount of traffic carried over the E5 network depends greatly on the deployment case used for the Radio Network. Based on the Baseband unit handling the cells, the amount of the following types of carrier aggregation traffic that the E5 network can transport varies:

- Internal traffic in the C-RAN sites
- Traffic between Baseband units
- Traffic between geographically separated C-RAN sites

The main Radio Network planning cases are as follows:

- Each Baseband manages cells from all carrier bands, and the cells provide coverage over the same geographic area. In this case, most of the carrier aggregation traffic between a PCell and a SCell is kept in the same Baseband unit, and there is less E-RAN carrier aggregation traffic in the E5 network. However, any outage in the operation of the Baseband unit can result in a total loss of network coverage for the geographic area.
- Each Baseband manages cells from a single carrier band. In this case, most of the carrier aggregation traffic between a PCell and a SCell is between Baseband units, resulting in more E-RAN carrier aggregation traffic on the E5 network. This provides more network resiliency to Baseband unit faults, as during an outage, only one specific carrier is not operational in an area, while the other carrier bands still provide coverage.

The decision of which deployment strategy to follow, including the allocation of Baseband units to VLANs, affects the following:

- Number of inter-switch links required
- Number of switches required in an E-RAN cluster
- Number of VLANs which need to be carried on these links

From the radio planning perspective, the recommendation for E-RAN deployment is based on the latency constraints of the E5 interface, and the distance between the radio unit and the Baseband unit.

The following recommendations apply:

- For a continuous E-RAN connected coverage area, there must be a network of cluster of co-located Baseband units, also known as hubs.
- Radio unit to Baseband unit distance can be up to 15 km. Starting from relationships between cells, a network of hubs within 15 km fiber distance of each radio unit is necessary. The network of hubs allows two radio units that have overlapping coverage to be in the same hub, or in adjacent hubs.
- Taking advantage of natural boundaries in coverage that can work enough without coordination, dramatically reduces the number of hubs.
- Proposal is for a core grid of hubs augmented by strings of hubs.
- Optimal hub sizes depend on the TN cost structure of the operator.
- Putting all cells at one antenna site on the same Baseband minimizes E-RAN Carrier Aggregation traffic.
- Lining cells up minimizes E-RAN network traffic. In this case, adjacent cells are on the same Baseband units, or Baseband units connected to the same switch.
- Even within a hub, it is advised to align cell placement with geography traffic.

The same deployment principles can be applied to the allocation of particular Baseband units to the E-RAN switches.

Baseband units controlling multiple carrier bands in the same geographic area are connected to the same E-RAN switch. In this case, most of the Carrier Aggregation traffic is contained within the Baseband unit, and the E-RAN Carrier Aggregation traffic is contained within the same switch. This is the recommended deployment to reduce required capacity for inter switch links between E-RAN switches.

It is not recommended to allocate single carrier Baseband units to a single switch. In this case, most of the Carrier Aggregation traffic is inter-switch, requiring many inter-switch links. Up to one inter-switch link for every Baseband unit connected to the switch can be necessary if using 10 GE links.

### 2.8.2 Inter-Switch Link Dimensioning

The amount of inter-baseband carrier aggregation traffic, and the amount of inter-E-RAN switch traffic can vary greatly based on how cells are assigned to Baseband units, and then Baseband units to E-RAN switches.

Following the deployment recommendations in E-RAN Deployment Strategy results in the reduction of inter-switch E-RAN traffic.

These recommendations are factored into internal studies of the capacity required for baseband to E-RAN switch links, and for the number of inter-switch links.

The traffic model used in the solution assumes a high amount of carrier aggregation between cells in the network, that is, that the maximum amount of E-RAN carrier aggregation is used in 20% of TTIs. In typical operation, it is much less than this. It is also assumed that the Baseband units are assigned to E-RAN switches geographically, and that the Baseband units control all cell carriers. This means that most of the traffic is intra-E-RAN switch, and limit the amount of inter-switch E-RAN traffic.

Based on the assumptions outlined in Inter Switch Dimensioning Recommendations, the traffic model shows that a single

10-Gbps IDLe link is sufficient for Carrier Aggregation traffic. This is based on the current limit of 2 Gbps of Carrier Aggregation traffic per Baseband, with the IDLe carrying up to 1.6 Gbps of Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation traffic through remote cells (EScells).

Following the same deployment assumptions, if there are N x Baseband units connected to an E-RAN switch, then N/2 links in and out of that E-RAN switch should meet the traffic requirements with occasional blocking.

As an example, consider an E-RAN switch (Router 6675) with 20 Baseband 5216 units connected, as shown in below figure.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 27   E-RAN Switch 100 GE Dimensioning

This rule defines the number of links needed to support the expected inter-switch E-RAN carrier aggregation traffic from the Baseband 5216 or Baseband 6630 connected to Router 6675\_1. This is based on an aggressive traffic model. If the deployment guidelines about allocation of cells to Baseband and Baseband to switch are followed, it is possible to connect 24 Baseband units, or 23 if a 10 GE port is reserved for OAM connectivity of the Router 6675 to a Router 6675. It is also possible to carry all necessary inter-switch traffic over a single 100 GE link.

The decision of which switches are at the remote end of these links, and the VLANs used to steer the traffic across the links, are based on the coordination partners of the Baseband 5216 or Baseband 6630 units connected to Router 6675\_1, as shown in below figue, where there are three Router 6675 units.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 28   100 GE Dimensioning Example

This figure shows the maximum number Baseband 5216 or Baseband 6630 units connected to Router 6675-1. In this case, assume that most of the E-RAN traffic is switch internal.

For CoMP, following the same deployment assumptions, N/2 links should be sufficient for inter-switch links.

For CoMP and carrier aggregation co-exist on Baseband, separate IDLe links used for carrier aggregation and CoMP, the maximum number of Baseband 5216 or Baseband 6630 units connected to Router 6675 depend on the maximum IDLe connectivity. Set M is the number of IDLe connectivity. If the carrier aggregation and CoMP are configured on all Basebands, the number of the Baseband N should be M/2. As an example, consider an E-RAN switch (Router 6675) with maximum 20 IDLe cables connected, the number of the Baseband N should be N/2 x 10GE links for carrier aggregation inter-switch link, N/2*10GE links for CoMP inter-switch link. The inter-switch link for carrier aggregation and CoMP is (N/2 + N/2) × 10 GE links = 1 × 100 GE link.

It is recommended to have separate devices for E-RAN carrier aggregation and E-RAN CoMP. For small E-RAN site (less than 10 Baseband unit), it would be possible to use a common device for carrier aggregation and CoMP, but be logically separated (using VLANs, and so on.) internally and on any inter-switch links.

## 2.9 Dual Connectivity

Downlink user data of the split DRB is sent over the Master Cell Group (MCG) or the Secondary Cell Group (SCG) radio resources. The selection of a specific type of radio resources is based on the quality of the SCG connection that can be set with system configuration. When the quality is optimal, the SCG radio resources are used. In case the SCG quality is below the set value, the MCG radio resources are used.

For EN-DC, the quality of the SCG connection is the NR radio access. Whereas in NR-DC it is the quality of the High-Band NR access.

Below figure shows the dual connectivity fast switching process.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 29   Dual Connectivity Fast Switch

The downlink user data of the split DRB is sent simultaneously over the MCG and SCG radio resources, as shown in below figure. A flow control mechanism at the gNodeB (the Secondary Node) guides the traffic over the different types of radio resources to minimize the reordering at PDCP layer of the UE.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 30   Dual Connectivity Downlink Aggregation

For EN-DC, the user plane data is controlled by the PDCP in the gNodeB and distributed through the X2 interface to the eNodeB.

Below figure shows the EN-DC function.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 31   EN-DC Function

The amount of user data sent through MCG radio resources over the X2 interface depends on LTE capability. For a 20-MHz carrier in LTE, the limitation is 200 Mbps for 256 QAM with two layers.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

For NR-DC, the user plane data is controlled by the PDCP in the Secondary Node for High-Band and distributed through the Xn interface to the Master Node.

Below figure shows the NR-DC function.

![Image](../images/328_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.AS/additional_3_CP.png)

Carrier Aggregation is supported with NR-DC in the following way:

Figure 33   Carrier Aggregation with NR-DC

The gNodeB releases any previously configured FR1 SCell at Secondary Node Addition, while the primary current PCell configuration is kept. This allows for only 1CC for downlink from the PCell, and up to 8CC downlink from the PSCell and the SCell. In this case, TN Capacity is calculated according to the following formula:
