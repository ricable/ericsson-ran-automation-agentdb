Node Software Compatibility over the Ericsson Proprietary E5 Interface

Interoperability between nodes running on different software versions is supported

through the Advanced RAN Coordination feature. The compatibility

between nodes software versions is limited by a window of 18 months, otherwise the

Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable

alarm is raised. The Compatible

Releases table lists the level of compatibility of the current release

with past releases other than the 18 months compatibility window.

Table 3   Compatible Releases

| Nodes           | Current Release   | Past Release      | Notes                                                                                                                             |

# 2 Other Network Elements

ENM

It is recommended to use the ENM version corresponding to the

RAN software release, for example ENM 22.4 for RAN 22.Q4. This ENM version supports all

earlier RAN software releases, as well as the corresponding release.

The ENM manages gNodeBs and eNodeBs using one of the locally stored MOMs. If the

locally stored MOM versions differ from the MOM version used by the managed node

software, the ENM manages each node by selecting the locally stored MOM version

closest to the MOM version stored on the node. In this case, the ENM does not

support the delta content between the ENM and node MOM versions.

If a new MOM is uploaded to the ENM using the Release

Independence Manager application, the delta content between the ENM and the node MOM

versions is erased and the full functionality of the node MOM is supported. Release

Independence Manager supports those ENM versions that were released no more than 12

months earlier than the RAN software release. For example, with the Release Independence

Manager, the RAN 21.Q4 software release is supported on ENM 20.4, or later.

For more information about the ENM, see the Ericsson

Network Manager, ENM, AOM 901 151 Library, EN/LZN 703 0205.

eNodeB

The eNodeB network element is part of the non-standalone deployment.

It is recommended that the gNodeB and the eNodeB use software from the same

release.

When the gNodeB and the eNodeB use software from different releases, one of the

following conditions must be true:

- The eNodeB uses software that has been released no more than three releases earlier than the software used by the gNodeB. Note: In the case of Q2 releases, the eNodeB can use software that has been released no more than four releases earlier than the software used by the gNodeB.
- The eNodeB uses software that has been released no more than one release later than the software used by the gNodeB.

For examples of compatible gNodeB-eNodeB software releases, see Example 1 and Example 2.

The feature content is of the level of the earlier software release used by either of

the nodes.

Example 1   The gNodeB Uses Software from the 20.Q4 Release

| 21.Q2                     | 21.Q3                     |

Evolved Packet Core

EN-DC deployments use the EPC network.

It is recommended to use S1AP version 15.5.0 or later.

MMEs must run on software version 1.18 or later.

5G Core

NR standalone deployments use the 5G core network.

It is recommended to use NGAP version 16.4.0 or later.

Other Factors

Table 6 covers frequency band combinations

for the following deployments:

- NR Standalone, 3GPP TS 38.101-1 for Low-Band and Mid-Band, and TS 38.101-2 for High-Band
- EN-DC, as described in 3GPP TS 38.101-3
- NR-DC, as described in 3GPP TS 38.101-3

Table 6 lists the frequency band

combinations included in the product, but product and feature constraints still

apply.

For more information, see feature descriptions, hardware configuration documents, and

the Network Impact Report for more information.

Band combination set 5, introduced in version 17.3.0, is not supported in any of the

releases before 24.Q4 GA.
