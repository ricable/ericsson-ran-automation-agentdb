# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to support solution architects in planning the transport network for deploying New Radio Non-Standalone (NR NSA) for Mid-Band and High-Band on an existing LTE network. The document focuses on initial planning of physical connectivity and logical connectivity.

This document aims to provide the following information:

- Detailed information about relevant network design aspects for solution architects and network integrators
- High-level overview about NR NSA connectivity and transport aspects for managers, marketing and sales representatives, and customers

## 1.1 General

This document provides connectivity guidelines for the deployment of NR NSA with Option 3x for Mid-Band and High-Band. The guidelines support high-level and low-level design activities by giving practical network deployment examples from the access, transport, and core domains.

For more information, see the following guidelines:

- E2E QoS Guideline
- NR Transport Dimensioning Guideline
- NR Transport Dimensioning Examples
- Network Synchronization Solution Guideline
- NR RAN Transport Security Guideline
- NR Optical Fronthaul Solution Guideline
- LTE-NR Dual Connectivity

## 1.2 Scope

This document provides considerations, recommendations, and requirements before introducing NR NSA with Option 3x for Mid-Band and High-Band on an existing LTE network.

This document describes the following topics:

- Connectivity and network security aspects of the S1 and X2 traffic
- Distributed RAN (D-RAN) and Centralized RAN (C-RAN) as Radio Access Network (RAN) deployment options with implications on physical and logical connectivity
- Overview of the hardware and software requirements

# 2 Principles and Guidelines

This section provides an overview of concepts connected to the NR NSA architecture, the details of LTE-NR dual connectivity, and aspects to be considered before deploying EN-DC.

## 2.1 NR Architecture Options

The 3GPP specifications for NR define a set of architecture options depending on the following aspects:

- Deployment of the core network architecture, that is "5G-enabled" Evolved Packet Core (EPC) or 5G Core (5GC)
- Support for dual connectivity between eNodeB and gNodeB
- Anchoring of control plane traffic from or to the MME (S1-C) on eNodeB, gNodeB, or both
- Termination of user plane traffic from or to the SGW (S1-U) on eNodeB, gNodeB, or both

The below figure shows examples of S1-C control plane traffic termination on different NR RAN architectures.

Figure 1   Termination of S1-C Control Plane Traffic from Core Network on eNodeB or gNodeB

The initial NR deployments are based on NR NSA Option 3, as shown in the above figure. In Option 3, the existing EPC network can be reused with new features. The control plane (S1-C) is implemented in the eNodeB.

NR NSA Option 3 has different versions. The below figure shows the version of NR NSA with Option 3x that is covered by Ericsson.

Note: Other architecture options can also be considered. However, the description of these options is out of the scope of this document.

### 2.1.1 EN-DC - Dual Connectivity

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 3   EN-DC Overview

The above figure shows the working principles of the E-UTRA-NR Dual-Connectivity (EN-DC) based on option 3x: LTE eNodeB works as the Master Node (MN), and NR gNodeB works as the Secondary Node (SN). Up to 256 gNodeB can connect to one eNodeB and up to 256 eNodeBs can connect to one gNodeB. EN-DC setup is triggered when the traffic exceeds the buffer threshold, this mechanism can reduce the UE battery consumption, SCG radio resource can be used for larger data session.

LTE eNodeB terminates the S1 Control Signaling (S1-C) from the 5G EPC and the Signaling Radio Bearer (SRB) toward the EN-DC capable UE.

The user Data Radio Bearer (DRB) can be set up as one of the following:

- MN-terminated Master Cell Group (MCG) DRB, this setup uses the following radio resource:
    - Master Cell Group (MCG)
- SN-terminated split DRB, this setup can use following radio resources:
    - Secondary Cell Group (SCG)
    - Master Cell Group (MCG)

NR gNodeB terminates the S1-U user plane of the Split bearer for the EN-DC UE. LTE eNodeB terminates the S1-U user plane of the MN terminated MCG DRB. The eNodeB and gNodeB have X2-C and X2-U connections, where the user data of Split bearer is carried over X2-U, and control signaling is carried over X2-C.

EN-DC UE trace provides UE trace signaling from eNodeB to gNodeB, which is UE-specific and filters on existing Performance Management (PM) events from cell trace. It applies to embedded gNodeB only.

In gNodeB, configuration of supported external link types are considered when calculating the cellState which the operator can set for each cell based on their individual needs. For more information, see the NR SA Connectivity Guideline with Option 2.

The below figure shows the route of data transmission for MN-terminated MCG DRB and SN-terminated split DRB. As gNodeB terminates the S1-U, the data traffic carried by MCG radio resource has to be forwarded from or to the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer of the gNodeB through the X2-U interface. The X2 interface carries a higher traffic load in 5G EN-DC networks compared to 4G LTE networks, therefore, this sets requirements on the transport network design for the X2 interface.

Figure 4   Data Transmission Flow of a Master Node Terminated DRB or Secondary Node Terminated Split DRB

### 2.1.2 Base Station Relations and Coverage Assumptions

The cell shape for NR is assumed to overlap with LTE to guarantee signaling connection between UEs and the eNodeB. NR cell selection is based on either UE measurements or an operator-configured LTE-NR cell relation.

See 5G Mobility and Traffic Management Guideline for more details about Secondary Node Addition by either configuration-based or measurement-based approach.

One eNodeB can be connected to multiple gNodeBs through the X2 interface, and similarly, one gNodeB can be connected to multiple eNodeBs. The below figure shows the base station relations and coverage assumptions in an EN-DC deployment.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 5   Base Station Relations and Coverage Assumptions

The base station relations between pairs of eNodeBs, and between eNodeBs and gNodeBs set requirements on the transport network design for X2.

### 2.1.3 Split DRB-Related Features

This section introduces several features related to split DRB. For more information, see the Manage Bearers and Services.

#### 2.1.3.1 Uplink-Downlink Decoupling

When using split bearers in the EN-DC, the Uplink-Downlink Decoupling feature extends the NR coverage. For uplink, the EN-DC UE uses MCG resource for the purpose for coverage. For downlink, it uses SCG resource for the purpose for high peak data rate and low-latency.

#### 2.1.3.2 Switching of Downlink MCG and SCG Resources

Downlink user data of the split DRB is sent over the Master Cell Group (MCG) or the Secondary Cell Group (SCG) radio resources. The selection of a specific type of radio resources is based on the quality of the NR connection that can be set with system configuration. When the quality is optimal, the SCG radio resources are used. In case the NR quality is below the set value, the MCG radio resources are used. The below figure shows the DL data bearer of the split DRB switches between the SCG and the MCG resources.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 6   Downlink MCG and SCG Resources Switching

#### 2.1.3.3 LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation

The downlink user data of the split DRB is sent simultaneously over the MCG and SCG radio resources, as shown in the below figure. A flow control mechanism at the gNodeB guides the traffic over the different types of radio resources to minimize the reordering at the PDCP layer of the UE.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 7   LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation

#### 2.1.3.4 LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

The uplink user data of the split DRB is sent simultaneously over the MCG and SCG radio resources, as shown in the below figure. The LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation feature supports maximum one LTE carrier plus one NR carrier aggregation in the uplink direction. Uplink EN-DC aggregation is triggered when the amount of available uplink data exceeds the set threshold.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 8   LTE-NR Uplink Aggregation

#### 2.1.3.5 Switching of Uplink MCG and SCG Resources

Uplink user data for a split DRB is transmitted over the MCG or the SCG resource, which is controlled by the NRCellDU.endcUlLegSwitchEnabled MOM parameter. If the parameter is set to false, then the MCG resource is used by default as shown in the below figure, and it is not switchable. Setting the parameter to true enables the Switching of the uplink MCG and SCG Resources feature, and the MCG or SCG radio resource used for the uplink user data switches depending on the NR connection quality.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 9   Static Uplink Radio Resource Allocation for Split DRB

As shown in the below figure, the switch is triggered based on the measurement result of the uplink NR signal quality and the threshold set.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 10   Uplink Radio Resource Switching for Split DRB

Note: The configuration for the split DRB has an impact on the transport network dimensioning for S1 and X2.

### 2.1.4 Mobility

For more details about mobility, see the 5G Mobility and Traffic Management Guideline.

### 2.1.5 Carrier Aggregation

Carrier aggregation gives higher throughput to EN-DC capable UEs by aggregating carriers of the same RAT for an enhanced EN-DC throughput. This solution guideline only covers intra-Baseband carrier aggregation, for inter-Baseband carrier aggregation, refer to Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline.

For further information, refer to Carrier Aggregation and XCC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension. X stands for 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

### 2.1.6 Automated Neighbor Relations

Automated Neighbor Relations (ANR) provides the functionality to find and create neighbors automatically. For more information, see:

Automated Neighbor RelationsNR Automated Neighbor Relations

## 2.2 NR NSA Option 3x Deployment Considerations

### 2.2.1 Backhaul Consideration

The following transport aspects must be considered:

- Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) and RAN traffic Quality of Service (QoS) support in the transport network for service differentiation
- One-way Latency
- Precision Time Protocol (PTP) over the transport network as an alternative for time and phase synchronization

The end-user performance for LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation using LTE-NR Dual Connectivity depends on a combination of factors, such as X2, radio capacity, latency, radio environment, and the application that is used.

Based on the case, the end-user performance can be higher in a network with shorter X2 latency. It is therefore recommended to use a one-way X2 delay of less than 5 ms. Nevertheless, flow control compensates for longer X2 delays to minimize the performance impact.

In C-RAN deployments, where multiple Baseband Units are clustered at the same site, the X2 links are kept within the same site as the Baseband Units. This allows low latency of X2 traffic.

The below table shows the recommended latency values for the user plane traffic of the eMBB use case as an example.

| Traffic          | Recommended One-Way Latency   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| S1               | < 30 ms                       |
| X2 (Handover)(1) | < 15 ms                       |
| X2 (EN-DC)(2)    | < 5 ms                        |
| CPRI or eCPRI    | < 75 µs                       |

Note(1): Handover traffic between eNB and gNB for mobility.

Note(2): EN-DC traffic supports Dual Connectivity by coordinating data flow between eNB and gNB.

Note: For other services with different service type other than eMBB, the one-way latency for each interface must be considered according to their respective PDB requirement. For detail PDB requirement of each service, see 3GPP 23.203.

The auto-integration procedure requires the DHCP relay agent function in the transport network if the Baseband node and the DHCP server are in different Layer 2 network domains. Configuring the DHCP relay functionality on the first Layer 3 Network Element is recommended.

### 2.2.2 Fronthaul Consideration

The fronthaul network carries digitized Radio Frequency data between Radio Units and Baseband Units and can be based on optical, Ethernet, or microwave technologies. Fronthaul networks are relevant for C-RAN deployments. In C-RAN deployments, the distance between the Remote Radio Units and the centralized Baseband Units is longer than in D-RAN deployments.

The Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) protocol is used between Baseband Units and Radio Units. However, it requires dedicated resources for each antenna branch. In addition, it has a low-bandwidth efficiency when the radio equipment supports Massive MIMO capabilities. The amount of traffic carried by the fronthaul network can be reduced by moving functions from the Baseband Units to the Remote Radio Units. The Common Public Radio Interface with support for 5G fronthaul (eCPRI) protocol takes advantage of this reduction and encapsulates fronthaul traffic into Ethernet frames.

To avoid impact on performance, the recommended value for the one-way latency is below 75 µs between a Baseband Unit and a Radio Unit. For low latency use cases, the 50-µs setting is recommended. This limits the maximum distance between the Baseband site and the Remote Radio Units to 15 km when using optical fronthaul (the propagation of light over fiber virtually accounts for the entire latency budget).

For more information on fronthaul, see NR Optical Fronthaul Solution Guideline and Ethernet Fronthaul Solution Guideline.

### 2.2.3 PDU Size Consideration

The Baseband node uses IPsec as a traffic protection mechanism. Proper maximum SCTP PDU size value should be considered to avoid fragmentation of packets in the transport network (TN) with the SctpProfile.maxSctpPduSize parameter, see chapter Transport Network Consideration in NR SA Connectivity Guideline with Option 2.

### 2.2.4 Synchronization Considerations

To meet the TDD Mid-Band or High-Band EN-DC requirements, both NR and LTE anchor Baseband Units must achieve the time and phase synchronization through GNSS or Precision Time Protocol (PTP).

To deploy EN-DC in TDD Mid-Band and High-Band cases, use one of the following possible time and phase synchronization solutions:

- RAN with Local PTP (G.8275.1) Time and Phase Synchronization Source
- RAN with PTP (G.8275.1) Time and Phase Synchronization Source in the Transport Network
- RAN Synchronization with GNSS Only
- Assisted Time Holdover is available to extend the availability for the different primary references (Assisting references: SyncE, APTS, AFTS, and OTA)

RAN Synchronization with GNSS is a straightforward approach to achieve time and phase synchronization. However, it needs GNSS connected to all Baseband Units.

Note: PTP over Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPN is not supported.

For more information on each synchronization solution, see the Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.

For more information on the configuration for each synchronization solution, see Manage Network Synchronization.

### 2.2.5 Quality of Service Considerations

For EN-DC, outgoing traffic is marked with a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value on the gNodeB. For the mapping of DSCP value and QCI value and more information, see E2E QoS Guideline.

### 2.2.6 Core Network Considerations

For the introduction of EN-DC, a 5G-enabled EPC network is required, which introduces a set of necessary features and specifies a minimum software level. A 4G EPC network can be upgraded to provide 5G EPC functionality.

Different Public Land Mobile Network Identifier (PLMN-Id) can be used by the anchor eNodeB to send the traffic to different packet core networks. Specific S1-U, S1-C, and X2-U termination points can be created for each PLMN. This functionality is provided by the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 (FAJ 121 4697) LTE RAN feature.

### 2.2.7 Security Considerations

The introduction of EN-DC does not add new requirements on OAM security and node hardening compared to the LTE solution. OAM traffic for the Baseband nodes is protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Shell (SSH) by default. In addition, OAM traffic can be carried within a dedicated Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPN to increase the security protection (for example, to hide the inner network).

#### 2.2.7.1 IPsec VPN between Baseband and SEG

For user plane traffic and control plane traffic, IPsec VPNs can be established between the Baseband Unit and the RAN Security Gateway (SEG) for both eNodeB and gNodeB. IPsec-protected X2 EN-DC traffic must go through a SEG if the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is not used between eNodeB and gNodeB pairs. The placement of the SEG and the associated transport latency for X2 EN-DC traffic needs to be considered, as it can negatively affect the end-user performance.

Note: The use of IPsec in the RAN is not mandatory, but it depends on the characteristic of Mobile Backhaul (MBH) and the specific customer requirement on it.

To achieve redundancy of IPsec between Baseband Unit and remote SEG, the following functionalities can be deployed with Juniper® SRX:

- RBS-based with Active-Active design or Active-Standby design when single IP address was being used by Baseband Unit for S1-C and S1-U.
    - This design offers Geographical Redundancy to two SEGs at different sites.
    - Dead Peer Detection (DPD) is the method of detecting a dead Internet Key Exchange (IKE) peer end and trigger primary-secondary or active-standby switch.
- RBS-based with Multiple IP Addresses for Security Gateway Resilience design when dual IP addresses were being used by Baseband Unit for S1-C and S1-U.
    - This design offers Geographical Redundancy to two SEGs at different sites.
    - The primary S1-U address and the corresponding SEG are chosen if they are available. If a failure of the primary IPsec VPN is detected by the DPD mechanism in Baseband, a failover to the secondary S1-U address and SEG is performed.
    - A smooth recovery of the S1-U traffic from the secondary SEG to the primary SEG is supported when the primary IPsec VPN is reestablished. The existing UEs retain on the secondary S1-U address and SEG while new connected UEs use the primary S1-U address and SEG.
    - Existing SCTP multihoming mechanism is used with two local S1-C addresses.
- SEGs deployed in a High Availability cluster.

Some considerations relative to mixed IPv4 and IPv6 deployment on EN-DC with IPsec are as follows:

The IP version used in the outer network can be different from the one used in the inner network. For example, IPv6 is used in the inner network for NR deployment, while the outer network can still use IPv4 based, which provides the flexibility during mixed IPv4 and IPv6 deployment on EN-DC.

Both IPv4 and IPv6 inner traffic can be encapsulated into the same IPsec VPN. Such mixed traffic flows must be ended from the same inner Virtual Router (VR).

For more information, see the NR RAN Transport Security Guideline | Multiple IP Addresses for Security Gateway Resilience | Manage IPsec.

#### 2.2.7.2 Direct IPsec VPN Connection between eNodeB and
        gNodeB

This feature introduces support for Direct IPsec VPN for X2 between eNodeBs and neighboring gNodeBs. The following key points must be considered:

- The primary goal for the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 feature is to protect the X2 user plane traffic. In untrusted backhaul cases, if separate addresses are used for X2-U and X2-C, the X2-C traffic is still sent to the remote SEG for protection, even after the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 has been established.
- Enabling the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 feature to protect EN-DC traffic is recommended. This way, the X2-U latency shortens compared to the IPsec case through remote SEG.
- The local outer endpoints can be defined in eNodeB in different use cases:
    - If only ENodeBFunction.ipsecEndcEpAddressRef MO is defined, only X2 EN-DC traffic can be protected by Direct IPsec VPN.
    - If only ENodeBFunction.ipsecEpAddressRef MO is defined, both X2 EN-DC traffic and X2 LTE traffic can be protected by Direct IPsec VPN.
    - If IPv4 for LTE and IPv6 for EN-DC was configured in eNodeB, and both X2 LTE and X2 EN-DC traffic need to be protected by Direct IPsec VPN, ENodeBFunction.ipsecEndcEpAddressRef must be configured in IPv6 and ENodeBFunction.ipsecEpAddressRef MO must be configured in IPv4.

For detailed configuration and information about the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 feature, see NR RAN Transport Security Guideline and Manage IPsec.

### 2.2.8 IP Version Support

A Baseband Unit acting as an eNodeB or as a gNodeB can support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for S1/X2, and OAM traffic. The IP protocol version used for OAM traffic can be selected regardless of the IP protocol version chosen for S1/X2. For the X2 interface in anchor eNodeB in the EN-DC case, the X2 interface towards gNodeBs can be defined with an IP version different from the IP version towards eNodeBs. If different IP versions are used for X2 interface towards eNodeBs and gNodeBs, different SCTP endpoints must be defined for legacy X2-C and X2-C EN-DC, respectively. The below figure shows the case, in which the anchor eNodeB is configured with IPv4-based legacy X2/S1 and IPv6-based X2 EN-DC, while the gNodeB is configured with full IPv6-based for all interfaces. An eNodeB that is using IPv4 for the X2 traffic towards adjacent eNodeBs can select IPv6 for its X2 EN-DC links towards adjacent gNodeBs.

Figure 11   Example of Different IP Versions Supported over X2 of Anchor eNodeB

The 5G EPC (MME + SGW) must support the handling of dual-stack IPv4+IPv6 (160-bit) Transport Network Layer (TNL) IP address as defined in 3GPP 36.414 which is used for S1-U establishment between the gNodeB and the 5G EPC when SCG resources are added in EN-DC case, as shown in the below figure. The LTE anchor eNodeB (depicted as Source eNB) must be able to handle the dual stack IPv4+IPv6 IP address (160-bit), and forward it to the gNodeB during an SCG resource addition in the EN-DC case.

1. EN-DC UE established an LTE call in source eNB (160-bit support)
2. During the S1-U setup, SGW passes IPv4 &amp; IPv6 S1-U UL GTP-U IPs to MME.
3. MME(160-bit support) forwards both IPs to Source eNB, and only the one with used IP version is used by eNodeB, but both IPs are stored in buffer.
4. EN-DC UE moves to target gNB.
5. During "NR Leg Addition request" source eNB passes both S1-U UL IPs to gNodeB, as it has no idea which IP version is being used by gNodB for S1-U.
6. Target gNB chooses IPv6 as it uses IPv6 over S1-U, and passes S1 DL GTP IP (IPv6 only) to source eNB, and such IP address is forwarded to SGW.
7. NR leg addition successful, S1-U data starts to be transferred between gNB and SGW directly for the EN-DC split bearer over IPv6.

### 2.2.9 TWAMP Performance Monitoring

Active measurement is a complement to passive monitoring. For an active measurement, a packet stream (test session) is injected into the network and can be monitored even in the absence of actual traffic. For more information, see the Manage Active Measurement in Transport Network. TWAMP (RFC5357) is realized in eNodeB and gNodeB with the TWAMP Initiator (FAJ 121 4557) and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Responder (FAJ 121 1791) features.

Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) supports active monitoring of IP paths between the Initiator and Responder by injecting TWAMP test packets traffic into the network over UDP/IP. It provides the following functions:

- One-way inter-packet delay variation metric-forward, and reverse direction
- One-way Packet loss, reordering, and duplication metric-forward, and reverse direction
- End-to-end availability
- Round-trip delay
- Measurements on DSCP value change of reflected test packets

In EN-DC, the X2 interface between the eNodeB and gNodeB has a special focus. If the X2 traffic is IPsec-protected and a centralized Security Gateway is deployed, X2 transport characterization can be monitored with TWAMP. TWAMP allows packet delay or packet loss measurement for a path on the X2 interface. If the Round-trip delay over X2 with a Security Gateway cannot satisfy the requirement of the EN-DC, and if there is some performance degradation, then consider the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 feature. Furthermore, TWAMP can also be used to monitor the characteristics of the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 tunnels as shown the figure.

TWAMP test sessions can be set up on both inner and outer interfaces of the IPsec VPN. By this, the sessions on the outer and inner interfaces can be compared. This comparison shows if any loss or delay occurs related to transport network or IPsec setup and components.

The below figure shows and example setup for IPsec VPN on the X2 interface.

Note: The numbers of supported TWAMP Responder MOs in each node are limited to 60 for RAN Compute Groups 4-5. For more information, see the RAN Compute Groups in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

### 2.2.10 NR Access Control

The NR Access Control function allows the control of access level of local and roaming subscribers to NR services in an EN-DC network. It applies to the following subscriber types:

- Local subscribers using EN-DC capable UEs without a 5G contract
- Roaming subscribers with EN-DC capable UEs, who can only use 4G services because of existing roaming policies

To enable this function in EN-DC networks, the activation of the following license and value package is required:

- 5G EPC: The NR Access Control function can prevent the use of NR radio resources for each individual UE.
- LTE anchor eNodeB: Activate the Basic Intelligent Connectivity (FAJ 801 1013) value package to support NR restriction evaluation for determining whether split bearer is allowed for EN-DC capable UEs.

NR Access decision logic of whether NR access is restricted in 5G EPC is based on the following conditions:

- NR Access Control feature state
- UE support for NR
- HSS subscription data
- Local SGSN-MME configuration

NR access is allowed in the following cases: The UE supports NR

The HSS subscription data does not restrict NR

The MME has no local configuration that restricts NR for the subscriber

Note: If any condition is not satisfied, 5G EPC does not permit the UE to use NR resources in EN-DC networks. 5G EPC informs the corresponding LTE anchor eNodeBs to prohibit the EN-DC capable UEs from using NR resources.

For more information, see the NR Access Control section of 5G EPC in the SGSN-MME library.

The below two figures show the examples where the NR Access Control is applied.

The below figure shows the case where a Master Node terminated DRB is established for an EN-DC capable UE. According to NR Access decision logic, if the UE is not permitted to use NR resources, the establishment of the Secondary Node terminated split bearer is not triggered regardless of the NR signal quality.

Figure 14   SCG Radio Resource Setup Not Triggered in NR Access Control

The below figure shows an EN-DC capable UE configured with a Secondary Node terminated split bearer with QCI9. If any change takes place in 5G EPC and the UE is not permitted to use NR resources, according to NR Access decision logic, the split bearer for QCI9 is immediately removed.

### 2.2.11 GTP-U Supervision Support in EN-DC

The GTP-U Supervision feature in gNodeB enables path monitoring towards peer nodes through S1-U, X2-U by specifying local IP addresses for each PLMN. The echo request and response messages allow the GTP-U paths to be supervised. GTP-U error indication is supported in gNodeB. GTP-U Echo round-trip delay measurements can be used to estimate the packet delay on S1-U links (towards SGW).

As below figure shown, the GTP-U supervision feature can be enabled by the GtpuSupervisionProfile.gtpuEchoEnabled MO attribute. Separate GtpuSupervisionProfile MO can be configured to enable GTP-U supervision function towards the same endpointResource but per different interface and with specific DSCP values as below figure shown.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 16   MO Instance for GTP-U Supervision in EN-DC

GTP-U supervision could be used to avoid S1-U traffic outage if there is connectivity issues between gNodeB and the SGW.

If for example IPsec is used, S1-C and S1-U are carried in different IPsec VPN connections, as S1-C traffic goes through eNodeB and S1-U traffic goes through gNodeB. If the S1-U IPsec VPN connection goes down, the S1-U address becomes disabled, but this is ignored by the gNodeB. If the S1-C IPsec VPN connection is still running at this moment, the NR leg remains for the existing UEs. In addition, the S1-U bearer requests from EN-DC capable UEs are still being accepted by gNodeB. This results in S1-U traffic drops for all UEs. The same apply when IPsec is not used. If there is a connectivity problem for S1-U but not S1-C, the gNodeB would not be aware unless GTP-U supervision is enabled.

To avoid such situations, the GTP-U Supervision function needs to be enabled in gNodeB for the S1-U interface. With the GTP-U Supervision function enabled, in case S1-U path failure is detected by gNodeB, all Secondary Node resources for UEs are released. RRC reconfiguration procedure would steer S1-U traffic of affected UEs to eNodeB. For new S1-U bearer requests from EN-DC UEs, the requests would be directly rejected by gNodeB. For more information, see the Bearer Handling section in GTP-U Supervision.

# 4 Example Network Designs

There are two main types of RAN deployment for EN-DC, D-RAN and C-RAN. In D-RAN, the Baseband Units are placed in short distances from the Radio Units at the cell site.

There are two types of C-RAN deployment. Either baseband clusters are remotely connected to the Radio Units, or Remote Radio Units are connected to a fronthaul network.

## 4.1 High-Band D-RAN with Cell Site Router

### 4.1.1 One High-Band AIR for Each Baseband

This example design is aiming for a high capacity NR solution, where one NR Baseband Unit connects one High-Band AIR Radio Unit. The three-sector site design requires three NR Baseband nodes, each supporting a single cell with a maximum bandwidth of 800 MHz with NR intra-band Carrier Aggregation with two layers MIMO in downlink.

In this design, each Baseband Unit directly connects to the CSR. This requires at least three available 10-Gigabit Ethernet capable transport network ports on the CSR besides the existing LTE connections.

Each Baseband NR Unit requires four CPRI ports with 10.1 Gbps CPRI line rate.

Note: The number of CPRI fibers varies between each Baseband NR and AIR Unit depending on capacity dimensioning and the terminated bandwidth use of High-Band.

Note: The dimensioning factor for one CPRI link with a 10.1 Gbps rate is 400 MHz.

#### 4.1.1.1 Physical Connectivity

The below figure shows the physical connectivity in D-RAN. The example shows the connectivity of the EN-DC High-Band deployment with RAN and GNSS is connected to the CSR to provide time and phase synchronization for all Baseband Units. For more information on synchronization, see the Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.

The below table shows the Network Elements of physical connectivity in D-RAN with NR Baseband Units directly connected to the CSR.

| Network Element   | Interface                                 | To                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|

| Baseband NR #1    | CPRI                                      | Radio Unit             |

Note: For more information on the 10G capable CPRI hardware-bandwidth dependencies, see Radio Node Configurations.

#### 4.1.1.2 Logical Connectivity

The logical connectivity design enables RAN (S1, X2) and OAM traffic (between ENM and the Baseband Unit) within IPsec VPNs. IPsec VPNs hide the inner network topology and the IP addresses. The logical connectivity design is recommended for RAN, as S1 and X2 traffic is not encrypted by default.

The use of IPsec VPNs is also recommended for OAM traffic, even though it is protected by default with either TLS or SSH.

Note: Use IPsec VPNs to protect RAN (S1, X2) and OAM traffic.

Enabling the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 feature in the Baseband Units is recommended to protect the X2 traffic with IPsec and to gain shorter X2-U latency.

Note: Use Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connections to protect X2 EN-DC traffic (between eNodeBs and gNodeBs) for a shorter X2 latency than with the remote SEG approach in IPsec cases.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 22   Baseband Units Directly Connected to the CSR

As shown in the above figure, each Baseband Unit has the following VRs:

- RAN Inner VR
- OAM Inner VR
- Outer VR

The inner IP addresses are bound by the references for S1, legacy X2, X2 EN-DC, or OAM service terminations. The inner IP address is configured using an IPv4 address with a /32 subnet mask or an IPv6 address with a /128 subnet mask, as it is a child of tunnel InterfaceIPv4 or InterfaceIPv6, which is encapsulated into an IPsecTunnel toward SEG, or a loopback interface.

The connection between inner and outer networks is established at the Managed Object (MO) level by encapsulating the inner network interface. The inner network interface corresponds to the tunnel InterfaceIPv4 or InterfaceIPv6 MOs. Encapsulation is performed using the IPsecTunnel MO. The IPsec VPN connection to the SEG (IPsecTunnel MO) is defined in the inner VR. The IPsec VPN connection is defined by the two endpoints in the outer network as follows (Therefore, two IPsec VPN connections cannot share the same pair of local and remote addresses in the outer network.):

- Local outer endpoint (EP) (IPsecTunnel.localAddress MO, local IKE peer)
- Remote outer EP (IPsecTunnel.remoteAddress MO, for example the SEG IKE-Gateway interface)

As shown in the above figure, the local outer endpoint corresponds to the IP addresses defined in the outer VRs, depicted as Ax. The remote outer endpoint corresponds to the IP addresses defined in the SEG, depicted as PeerIP.OAM and PeerIP.RAN, which are also defined in the same outer VR with local outer endpoints.

This example shows the case, in which the same IP address ends the traffic of X2-C, X2-U, and S1-C/U. For the configuration for different IP addresses for X2-C, X2-U, and S1 IP service terminations, see Manage Transport Network.

In this example, Baseband LTE and Baseband NR are IPv4-based. Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is established to protect X2 EN-DC traffic only between eNodeB and gNodeB pairs, as follows:

1. In each eNodeB and gNodeB pairs, set local outer address in eNodeB ENodeBFunction.ipsecEndcEpAddressRef MO and gNodeB LocalIPsecEndpoint.outerIpAddressRef and LocalIPsecEndpoint.interfaceList =X2 MO which is in the EndpointResource in GNBCUUPFunction.
2. On the eNodeB side, manually configure the X2-C address TermPointToGNB.ipAddress on the proxy eNodeB.
3. The X2-C connection setup is initiated by the eNodeB through the SEG. After the X2-C setup is successfully completed, a Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connection is created automatically.

Note: Node restart is needed on both eNodeB and gNodeB to take effect. If ENodeBFunction.ipsecEpAddressRef is used, restart is not needed. However, it is not used in this case and therefore the restart is required.

The traffic is routed based on its destination. Initially, all traffic is routed to the SEG, based on a default route. After establishing the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connections, a new static route with a specific destination IP address is created internally. This route allows X2 traffic to be sent through this direct connection.

A single VLAN (TN-Untrust) is used for all traffic carried on the point-to-point links between the Baseband Units and the CSR. The traffic is ended at a single VRF on the CSR (Untrust VRF).

The interface IP addresses of the outer VR in the eNodeB can be allocated by the DHCP server during the autointegration procedure. In such cases, the DHCP Relay function must be enabled in the CSR if the following conditions are true:

- The CSR cannot provide the DHCP server function.
- The DHCP server is behind the CSR.

For more information about the configuration of IPsec in Baseband Units, see Manage IPsec.

##### 4.1.1.2.3 Application Traffic Flow

All traffic is protected with IPsec through the CSR. Before the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connections are established, the S1 and X2 traffic flows go through the remote SEG. After Direct IPsec VPN for X2 between the eNodeB and gNodeB pairs is established, the X2 EN-DC traffic goes through this direct tunnel, while S1 traffic keeps going through the IPsec tunnel towards the SEG.

In addition, the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connections to the remote Baseband nodes go through the CSR and reach the peer Baseband Units, bypassing the SEG; this is not shown in the below figure.

The SEG is also responsible for the following:

- Forwarding the S1-C traffic from the Baseband LTE to the MME
- Forwarding the S1-U traffic from the Baseband Units to the SGW or PGW
- Forwarding the S1 traffic from the core networks to the Baseband Units
- Forwarding the OAM traffic from the Baseband Units to the ENM
- Forwarding the OAM traffic from the ENM to the Baseband Units
- Routing the X2-C setup messages to the adjacent Baseband Units during the X2-C setup phase.
- Routing the X2 traffic to the adjacent Baseband Units if a Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connection is unavailable.

OAM and RAN traffic are recommended to be separated in different IPsec VPNs.

### 4.1.2 Omni-Cell of Cascading High-Band Air for Each Baseband
      Unit

Fronthaul Sharing enables either a 240-degree or a 360-degree omni-cell solution with reduced number of fibers to the site, each radio covers 120-degree coverage. The omni-cell is made up of an omni-sector that consists of two or three radios connected in a cascade configuration. The total occupied bandwidth of the omni-sector is 800 MHz. There are two fiber strands to the site with 2x10.1 Gbps or 2x24.3 Gbps. When it is 10.1 Gbps, the total occupied bandwidth of the sector is 400 MHz, when it is 24.3 Gbps, the total occupied bandwidth is 800 MHz. The 24.3 Gbps configuration requires a Baseband Unit from RAN Compute group 5. The omni-cell does not allow simultaneous transmission to or from different radios. Each radio transmits or receives only when addressed. This way, the cell bandwidth requirement can be met using only two fiber strands connected to the site to save capital expense. SCG resource switching is not needed within the omni-cell.

Note: For more information on 400-MHz bandwidth, 800-MHz bandwidth, and Fronthaul Sharing hardware-bandwidth dependencies, see Radio Configurations for NR and Fronthaul Sharing.

The below figure shows the physical connectivity of an omni-cell example of 800-MHz bandwidth with Baseband 6648 and AIR 1281.

The CPRI links from the NR Baseband Unit are connected to Data port 1 and 3 on the first AIR 1281, which go out to the next AIR radio on Data port 2 and 4.

### 4.1.3 Hardware-based Switching for Cascaded Nodes

Several sites having multiple baseband nodes colocated, and require to connect to a single backhaul fiber. For cascaded topologies having capacity limitations on the node, because of simultaneous handling of termination and cascaded traffic flows, one option is using Bridging for cascaded traffic with LowLatencySwitching option turned on. This causes the cascaded bridged traffic to use Hardware-based Switching functionality on the node, which uses separate hardware resources on the node. The Hardware-based switching feature has some limitations mentioned in the below section.

The figure below show a high-level view of traffic handling on a node in cascaded topology, using Bridge feature with and without LowLatencySwitching enabled. As can be seen, with the Hardware-based switching enabled, separate hardware switch is used in the node for switching of cascaded traffic. There can be multiple Bridge MOs configured on a node, having different settings for the LowLatencySwitching attribute. The default setting for the attribute is false, in which case regular bridging is used. This is sufficient for most of the deployments. Hardware-based switching supports deployments with applicable *RAN Compute Group 4, 5 and 6. For more information, see RAN Compute Groups in DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Figure 25   Cascaded baseband nodes traffic flow

Hardware-based switching provides an option of lower latency switching with higher switching capacity on Baseband. This is managed by attribute "lowLatencySwitching" in the Bridge MO as shown in the below figure. This attribute is false by default. By setting the attribute value to true, Hardware-based switching continues to support existing features, e.g, Tagged or Untagged VLANs, LAG, BVI, but loss PM counters for switched traffic and TN QoS functions under affected EthernetPort MOs.

Figure 27   Co-existence of default switching with Hardware-based switching

The below figure shows a typical example of three-sector cascaded baseband nodes in a Streetmacro (SM670x supporting hardware switching function) connectivity case. From a dimensioning perspective, the below examples could be referenced:

- Once the peak throughput between SM670x #1 and SM670x #2 is higher than TN port capacity (10GE) over cascade-link 1, or peak throughput over 'Backhaul' between SM670x #1 and Core Network is higher than TN port capacity (10GE), it is recommended to modernize the TN port capacity from 10GE to 25GE, or TN QoS Shaping can be considered for better traffic handling once TN port modernization is impossible.
- If there is a capacity trade-off between termination and cascaded forwarded capacity, Hardware-based Switching can be enabled, also considering the limitations with the feature.

For more information related to dimensioning aspects, see NR Transport Dimensioning Guideline and NR Transport Dimensioning Examples.

Besides the dimensioning criterion shown above, real-time PM counters for terminated and switched traffic volume should also be monitored at SM670x #1 and SM670x #2, so migration decision from regular switching to Hardware-based switching or TN port modernization from 10G to 25G can also consider real-time traffic load over Cascade-link 1&amp;2, especially over rush hours. For detail cascaded nodes connectivity design, refer to solution examples in section  D-RAN with NR Baseband Cascaded to LTE Baseband.

The below table gives a summary of recommended use cases when default switching and hardware-based switching can be used.

Note: There are limitations that need to be consider before enabling the Hardware-based switching, for more information please refer to CPI FED Hardware-Based Switching for Site Connectivity document.

## 4.2 D-RAN with Three-Sector for Each NR Baseband with CSR

The gNodeB can support three-sector site configuration for NR Low-Band, Mid-Band, and High-Band deployment. Each sector contains a single component carrier. Cell bandwidth can be any of the following options, depending on the radio capability, refer to the Supported Radio Capabilities list in the NR RAN Library.

In this EN-DC example design, both Baseband Units directly connect to the CSR. This requires at least one available 10-Gigabit Ethernet-capable transport network port on the CSR besides the existing LTE connections.

For each sector, the maximal cell DL MIMO capability for High-Band AAS, Mid-Band AAS, and Mid-Band non-AAS is as follows:

- High-Band case: 200-MHz bandwidth with two layers SU-MIMO in downlink for each sector
- Mid-Band AAS case: 100-MHz bandwidth with eight layers MU-MIMO in downlink for each sector
- Mid-Band non-AAS case: 100-MHz bandwidth with four layers SU-MIMO in downlink for each sector

## 4.4 D-RAN with NR Baseband Cascaded to LTE Baseband

Upgrading an LTE site in terms of the transport network can cause difficulties before the deployment of NR Baseband. In such cases, the NR Baseband Unit can be cascaded to the existing LTE Baseband Unit in a daisy-chained setup. There is no additional hardware requirement for backhaul transport in an NR deployment. The existing LTE backhaul capacity can be upgraded from 1-Gigabit Ethernet to 10-Gigabit Ethernet for each planned NR capacity. The necessary configurations must be added also in the LTE Baseband and TN router to enable NR Baseband connectivity.

Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is recommended between the LTE Baseband and the cascaded NR Baseband through the direct cable to reduce the EN-DC X2 latency.

Two approaches can be adopted to enable such cascading configuration as follows:

- Layer 3 based switch between Baseband LTE and Baseband NR
- Layer 2 based switch between Baseband LTE and Baseband NR

In the example design, RAN with GNSS and APTS as assisting reference is used for time and phase synchronization. While GNSS is not mandatory in this case, if GNSS is unavailable, the RAN with PTP Time and Phase Synchronization Source in the Transport Network synchronization solution can also be deployed in this case to provision time and phase synchronization to both Baseband Units. For more information on synchronization solution, see the Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.

### 4.4.1 Physical Connectivity

In this cascading example, one NR Baseband connects to up to three NR Radio Units and one LTE Baseband connects to three LTE Radio Units. A TN router is deployed to aggregate the MBH traffic.

The below figure shows the physical connectivity of the D-RAN case with NR Baseband cascaded to LTE Baseband.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 32   Physical Connectivity with NR Baseband Cascaded to LTE Baseband

With such a TN configuration, the NR site deployment depends on the available TN link capacity of the LTE Baseband.

#### 4.4.1.1 1 GE LTE TN Case

During NR RAN peak dimensioning, one NR sector is supported with a maximal bandwidth of 20 MHz and two layers, on the following conditions:

- The maximal TN link capacity of the LTE Baseband Unit is 1-Gigabit Ethernet.
- It is not possible to upgrade to 10-Gigabit Ethernet.

This design applies only to AAS or non-AAS solutions in NR Mid-Band or Low-Band FDD NR. The uptake of NR subscribers and corresponding capacity increase is not expected.

#### 4.4.1.2 10 GE LTE TN Case

The TN link capacity of the LTE Baseband Unit can be upgraded to 10-Gigabit Ethernet before NR deployment. In such cases, the cascaded NR site can be configured with any of the following options:

- Three sectors with a 20-MHz cell bandwidth and four layers for downlink MIMO (AAS or non-AAS Mid-Band or Low-Band solution, 3:1 TDD, DL 256-QAM)
- Three sectors with 100-MHz cell bandwidth and eight layers for downlink MU-MIMO (AAS or non-AAS Mid-Band solution, 3:1 TDD, DL 256-QAM)
- One sector with maximum 800 MHz (8CC) ended bandwidth and two layers (AAS: High-Band solution, TDD 3:1, DL 64-QAM)

The below table shows the Network Elements of NR Baseband Units that cascaded to LTE Baseband.

| Network Element   | Interface (Port)                                              | To           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| NR Baseband       | 1-Gigabit Ethernet or 10-Gigabit Ethernet (for example, TN A) | LTE Baseband |
| NR Baseband       | CPRI or eCPRI                                                 | Radio Unit   |
| LTE Baseband      | 1-Gigabit Ethernet or 10-Gigabit Ethernet (for example, TN B) | TN           |
| LTE Baseband      | 1-Gigabit Ethernet or 10-Gigabit Ethernet (for example, TN C) | NR Baseband  |
| LTE Baseband      | CPRI or eCPRI                                                 | Radio Unit   |

### 4.4.2 Logical Connectivity

#### 4.4.2.1 Layer 3 Route Based Cascading Use Case

The below figure shows how to configure the cascading function through Layer 3 route, including logical connectivity, IP planning, and route setting in each VR.

The key points are outlined for this Layer 3 route approach, as follows:

- The Baseband LTE requires a second TN port (TN C in the below figure), and a second interface (A) defined in the same outer VR with A2, for forwarding the traffic to the Baseband NR.
- The TN Router requires a specific route with a next hop to the Baseband LTE (TN-Untrust-LTE.B in the below figure) for transmitting all traffic to the Baseband NR.
- X2 EN-DC traffic between Baseband NR and Baseband LTE is terminated between the two cascaded nodes through the direct cable, for both trusted and untrusted cases, not through TN Router.
- A1 and A2 must be in the same subnet.
- To enable a Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connection, use the following configuration:
    - A1 is set as the outer IP address of the Baseband with NR traffic, as a local endpoint of IPsec VPN toward SEG, and Direct IPsec VPN for X2 EN-DC traffic in NR side.
    - A3 is set as the outer IP address of the Baseband with LTE traffic, as a local endpoint of IPsec VPN toward SEG, and Direct IPsec VPN for X2 for either X2 EN-DC traffic in LTE side, or for legacy X2 traffic.
- The Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is terminated between A1 and A3; the X2 EN-DC traffic goes through the Direct IPsec VPN for X2 over the direct cable between Baseband LTE and Baseband NR, not through TN router.

For more information about the configurations of Direct IPsec VPN for X2 connections, see Manage IPsec.

The below figure shows the Layer 3 route-based approach between Baseband LTE and Baseband NR.

Figure 34   Baseband NR Cascaded to Baseband LTE through Layer 2 Switch without BVI

The key points are outlined for the Layer 2 switch approach, as follows:

- Layer 2 bridge is defined in Baseband LTE for forwarding NR traffic between A1 and A2, over a VLAN "TN-Untrust-NR".
- From the TN router perspective, Baseband NR is the same as Baseband LTE, they are both directly connected with different VLANID.
- X2 EN-DC traffic between Baseband NR and Baseband LTE has to go through the TN router, and through A2 and B2 for both trusted and untrusted cases.
- Feature Direct IPsec VPN for X2 applies for X2 EN-DC traffic between two nodes, and terminated between A1 and B1, but the traffic has to go through the TN router, and through A2 and B2 as below the red line shown.
- This approach can be advantageous if changing the IP configuration of the LTE Baseband is not permitted.
- Layer 2 bridge can be used with lowLatencySwitching attribute equals to true, in case to enable Hardware-based switching with or without BVI option. Traffic switch with such a bridge has some limitations, for more detail, refer to the section Hardware-based Switching for Cascaded Nodes or CPI FED Hardware-Based Switching for Site Connectivity document.

Figure 35   Baseband NR Cascaded to Baseband LTE through Layer 2 Switch with BVI

After Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is established between Baseband LTE and Baseband NR, the X2 EN-DC traffic is terminated between the two Baseband Units over the direct cable.

However, with the BVI approach, the IP configuration in Baseband LTE has to be modified, the encapsulation of the outer IP interface is changed from VLANport to Bridge.

## 4.5 D-RAN with NR Baseband Units Connected to the CSR (IPv6
    Based)

This section provides three connectivity solutions for deploying NR with IPv6 in EN-DC, as follows:

- Case 1: eNodeB and gNodeB connect to the common CSR, with no direct cable in between, X2 EN-DC traffic goes through CSR.
- Case 2: eNodeB and gNodeB connect to the common CSR, with a direct cable in between, and with separate TN port, X2 EN-DC traffic goes through the direct cable.
- Case 3: eNodeB and gNodeB connect to the common CSR, with trusted backhaul for X2 over direct cable.

For the first two designs, the backhaul network is untrusted, and Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is established to protect X2 EN-DC traffic.

For the LTE network, the RAN traffic and the OAM traffic are IPv4-based. For X2 EN-DC traffic, it is IPv6-based. For the NR network, the RAN traffic and the OAM traffic are fully IPv6-based.

### 4.5.1 Physical Connectivity Case 1: Typical Case

The physical connectivity in this example is the same as in other D-RAN Mid-Band configurations, that is,  D-RAN with Three-Sector for Each NR Baseband with CSR configuration or  D-RAN with Six-Sector Supported NR Baseband Unit configuration in a previous chapter.

#### 4.5.1.1 Logical Connectivity

In this example, the Baseband LTE works in mixed IPv4+IPv6 mode, for example, it connects to other eNodeBs through an IPv4-based IP address and connects to gNodeBs through IPv6-based address over the X2 EN-DC interface. For this configuration, the Baseband LTE has one IPv4 outer address and one IPv6 outer address, the two outer addresses are defined as interface IP into the same outer VR, and encapsulated in the same VlanPort MO. The IPv6 outer address is defined as the local outer endpoint of Direct IPsec VPN for X2 EN-DC traffic in LTE side. The IPv4 outer address is defined as the local outer endpoint of both IPsecTunnel to SEG and Direct IPsec VPN for X2 to other eNodeBs.

In addition, the second inner IP address with IPv6 is defined in the same inner RAN VR of Baseband LTE, named X2 EN-DC IP (as depicted in the below figure), which is used to end IPv6 X2 EN-DC traffic on the LTE side. Therefore, both SCTP and user plane references for X2 EN-DC traffic are pointing to this new added inner IP address. 5G EPC and ENM are required to work in IPv4+IPv6 dual-stack mode to support such a case.

Figure 36   Logical Connectivity of case 1

The below figure shows traffic flows with IPsec VPN tunnel and Direct IPsec VPN for X2.

Figure 37   Traffic Flows Route Illustration through IPsecTunnel or Direct IPsec VPN for X2 for case 1

In the Baseband LTE, the inner VR of LTE RAN traffic has two inner IP addresses, one LTE IPv6 RAN traffic address and one LTE IPv4 RAN traffic address, both inner IP addresses are defined as IPsec tunnel interface. The IPsecPolicy is defined to make the two IPsec tunnel interfaces share an IPsec VPN tunnel towards the SEG.

There are two local outer addresses in eNodeB, the IPv4 and IPv6 outer addresses are defined in the same outer VR. After Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is established, the X2 EN-DC traffic between eNodeB and gNodeB changes its route from IPsec VPN Tunnels towards the SEG (as shown in the above figure with the blue dotted line), to Direct IPsec VPN for X2 ended by A1 and A2.

As the below table shows, two different VLAN IDs are configured for this example.

| VLAN ID                   | Network Element   | Description                                                                          |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IPv6-TN-Untrust-NR        | Baseband NR       | Outer network carrying IPsec-protected traffic (IPv6 S1-U/X2 EN-DC, IPv6 OAM)        |
| IPv4+IPv6-TN-Untrust- LTE | Baseband LTE      | Outer network carrying IPsec-protected traffic (IPv4 S1/X2, IPv4 OAM, IPv6 X2 EN-DC) |

##### 4.5.1.1.3 Application Traffic Flow

For the LTE Baseband, the RAN traffic is protected through the following Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPN connections:

- IPv6 X2 EN-DC packets are protected by the Direct IPsec for X2 IPsec VPN connection.
- IPv4 S1 packets are protected by IPsec VPN connection through a remote SEG and IPv4 X2 by Direct IPsec VPN connection.
- IPv4 OAM traffic is protected in another IPsec VPN connection through a remote SEG.

For the NR Baseband, the RAN traffic is protected through the following IPsec VPN connections:

- IPv6 X2 EN-DC packets are protected by the Direct IPsec for X2 IPsec VPN connection.
- IPv6 S1-U LTE packets are protected by the IPsec VPN connection through a remote SEG.
- IPv6 OAM traffic is protected in another IPsec VPN connection through a remote SEG.

### 4.5.2 Physical Connectivity Case 2: Direct Cable Exists between
      Colocated Baseband Units in Untrust Network

#### 4.5.2.1 Logical Connectivity

Compared to case 1, the only difference in this case is that there is one direct cable between the second TN ports of two colocated Baseband Units, as shown in the below figure.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 41   Logical Connectivity of case 2

There is no difference for inner VR configuration compared to case 1, but for outer VR, one more outer IP address is defined in the same outer VR, depicted as A2 and A3, both IPv6-based. After proper routes are in place in both outer VRs (as shown with the green circles), X2 EN-DC traffic between these two colocated Baseband Units is routed to go through the direct cable other than CSR as case 1, after Direct IPsec VPN for X2 is established.

While A1 and A2 are in the same outer VR but with different subnet, the subnet is similar for A3 and A4.

While A2 and A3 are within the same subnet (as A2 and A3 do not have to be reachable from outside and do not have to be part of the overall address plan), they can be defined locally. This way, the same IP addresses can be used in other pairs of colocated eNodeB and gNodeB.

The below figure shows the route of traffic flows through IPsecTunnel or Direct IPsec for X2 IPsec VPN. All X2 EN-DC traffic flows towards other eNodeBs, goes through a Direct IPsec tunnel through CSR, then uses the direct cable between co-site eNodeB and gNodeB.

### 4.5.3 Physical Connectivity Case 3: IPv4-Based Trusted Backhaul
      for X2 Over Direct Cable

#### 4.5.3.1 Logical Connectivity

This case describes the colocated Baseband Units in the trusted network, no IPsec is needed, as shown in the below figure.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 43   Logical Connectivity for Trusted Case

This is an IPv4-based case, both Baseband NR and LTE are IPv4. A1 and A2 are in the same subnet, A1 and A2 do not have to be reachable from outside and do not have to be part of the overall address plan, A1 and A2 can be defined locally, then the same IP address of A1 and A2 can be used as other pairs in the colocated eNodeB and gNodeB. The EN-DC X2 traffic goes through the direct cable, LTE, and NR S1 traffic, OAM traffic are transferred through the router, the below figure shows the route of traffic flows with direct cable in the trusted case.

## 4.6 D-RAN with NR Baseband and LTE Baseband Sharing the Same
    Radio Unit for the Same Operator

### 4.6.1 D-RAN with AIR 6488 in Split Mode

Split mode LTE+NR with MSMM (Multistandard Mixed Mode) is a mixed mode configuration, where LTE and NR carriers are allocated to different parts of the antenna. This feature adds NR capabilities to the network without needing more radio equipment or rebuilding the antenna sites to introduce NR.

After adding multiple NR sector cells, the number of LTE cells can be maintained in the existing network. Therefore, the split mode solution introduces NR to an existing LTE network with minimal operator impact, and it does not require specific configuration; however, it requires alterations to the LTE and NR cell planning.

In split mode configuration, an AIR 6488 is connected to two Baseband Units that belong to different Managed Elements. Furthermore, the 64TR antenna is divided into two 32TR parts, which increases the Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW) compared to the 64TR configuration.

The antenna configuration is based on the chosen cell shape, as shown in the below figure. The following configurations are possible:

- Macro: Vertical split of antenna
- Hotspot: Horizontal split of antenna
- High-rise: Vertical split of antenna

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 45   Antenna Configurations for Different Cell Shapes

The following configurations are supported by one AIR 6488 Radio Unit in split mode:

- 40 MHz NR + 3×20 MHz LTE
- 60 MHz NR + 3×20 MHz LTE

The fronthaul connectivity types between Baseband Units and AIR Radio Units are as follows in the current design:

- The Baseband Unit with the LTE traffic is connected with two eCPRI links.
- The Baseband Unit with the NR traffic is connected with one eCPRI link.

The below reference solution shows an example to support a three-sector configuration, each site was deployed with the following (as shown in the below figure):

- 3×LTE Baseband Units
- 1×NR Baseband Unit
- 3×AIR 6488 Radio Units

Split mode configuration requires phase synchronization between the nodes connected to the shared radio, which is assured by time and phase synchronizing both nodes through GNSS or PTP synchronization solutions. AIR Units can use any Baseband Unit as a synchronization source and perform switchover without any impact on the ongoing traffic. The below example shows the GPS Unit GRU 0401 plus splitter provides four outputs, so that all Baseband Units can be synchronized from the same GRU. The prerequisite is that PTP or Dual GNSS receivers to the Baseband Units must have the same origin reference.

For more information about split mode configuration, see Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO.

### 4.6.2 D-RAN with AIR 6488 in Mixed Mode

The below figure shows one example configuration with Mixed Mode Radio AIR 6488. AIR 6488 connects to NR Baseband and LTE Baseband simultaneously, supporting mixed mode for Massive MIMO where all the 64 TRXs can be used by NR and LTE simultaneously, and where NR carrier and LTE carriers share the output power. Mixed Mode Radio can improve Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) and Effective Isotropic Sensitivity (EIS).

### 4.6.3 D-RAN with 2T/4T/8T TDD Mid-Band Radio in Mixed
      Mode

The below figure shows a reference example of a mixed mode 2T/4T/8T TDD radio with Mixed Mode Baseband case.

![Image](../images/329_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.EE/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 48   2T/4T/8T TDD Mid-Band Mixed Mode Radio with Mixed Mode Baseband

The mixed mode TDD radio - such as Radio 2228, Radio 4418, or Radio 8863 - that connects to Mixed Mode Baseband can provide NR TDD and LTE TDD service coverage simultaneously. LTE anchor radio connects to Baseband LTE. Both mixed mode TDD radio and LTE anchored radio are connected through CPRI connections.

In this Mixed Mode Baseband and Mixed Mode Radio case, PTP time and phase synchronization is the external synchronization reference. For more detailed synchronization information, see the Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.

For more information of supported mixed mode non-AAS radio use cases, see Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.

## 4.7 C-RAN Mid-Band Site with Redundant CSR

This designed example describes a C-RAN site deployment. NR Baseband Units and LTE Baseband Units are located in the same Baseband Hotel site. They are connected to the Remote Radio Units through a fronthaul network. Each Baseband Unit connects to two CSRs for improved redundancy if there is a transport link failure. The MBH in this example is trusted without the need to deploy IPsec VPNs.

### 4.7.1 Physical Connectivity

The below figure shows the Mid-Band physical connectivity deployment for a typical three-sector antenna site. One NR Baseband Unit has three AIR Radio Units connected, one LTE Baseband Unit has three LTE Radio Units connected. Each Baseband Unit connects to two Baseband Hotel routers directly. GNSS is connected to the CSR to provide time and phase synchronization for all Baseband Units.

RAN with Local PTP Time and Phase Synchronization Source synchronization solution is used in this example. The two Baseband Hotel routers connected with GNSS work as GM candidates, therefore failover of GM is possible in case outage occurs at any of the GNSS. In the Baseband, set a local priority to use the same CSR for synchronization referenceFor more information about synchronization solutions, see Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.

### 4.7.2 Logical Connectivity

The IP addresses of RAN traffic and OAM traffic are defined as loopback addresses which can be reached through both physical ports on the Baseband Units. If there is a link failure, the loopback address is still reachable through the remaining link.

The below figure shows the Mid-Band logical connectivity deployment for a typical three-sector antenna site.

#### 4.7.2.1 Routing

Each Baseband Unit connects to two routers through static routing. Different priority for each router can be used to prefer one router as default gateway.

To achieve load balance in the two CSRs, in NR baseband, adminDistance value for CSR1 is set lower than for CSR2, CSR1 has higher priority. In LTE baseband, adminDistance value for CSR2 is set lower than for CSR1, CSR2 has higher priority.

The below table shows VR outer static routes from NR Baseband to CSR.

| IP Network   | Next Hop.address   | Description     |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 0/0          | (CSR1-to-BB-NR).B  | Preferred route |
| 0/0          | (CSR2-to-BB-NR).B  | Preferred route |

The below table shows VR outer static routes from LTE Baseband to CSR.

| IP Network   | Next Hop.address   | Description     |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 0/0          | (CSR1-to-BB-LTE).B | Backup route    |
| 0/0          | (CSR2-to-BB-LTE).B | Preferred route |

The CSR needs static routes to the loop back prefixes. These routes need to be imported to the MBH routing. If there is a link failure to the baseband, the static route is removed in the CSR routing table and the traffic is sent to the other CSR over the inter-CSR link and forwarded to the Baseband from there.

The below table shows VR-trusted routes from CSR to NR Baseband.

| IP Network   | Next Hop.address   | Description        |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| S1 or X2 /32 | (CSR2-to-BB-NR).A  | Route to NR VR RAN |
| OAM /32      | (CSR2-to-BB-NR).A  | Route to NR VR OAM |

The below table shows VR-trusted routes from CSR to LTE Baseband.

| IP Network   | Next Hop.address   | Description         |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| S1 or X2 /32 | (CSR2-to-BB-LTE).A | Route to LTE VR RAN |
| OAM /32      | (CSR2-to-BB-LTE).A | Route to LTE VR OAM |

The below table shows the route priority setting for NR Baseband or LTE Baseband.
