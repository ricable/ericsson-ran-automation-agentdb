# 1 CQI-Based UE Energy Efficiency Enhancement Overview

This feature allows the detection of UE overheating during carrier aggregation and it

prevents connection loss by restricting the scheduling of the UE.

Summary

The downlink and uplink traffic on the SCG radio resource is restricted to PSCell only. This

allows the UE to cool down, which results in a more efficient use of UE battery

resources. This feature ensures that the connection is retained at a stable lower

throughput until the UE recovers.

This feature is only supported by High-Band.

# 2 Dependencies of CQI-Based UE Energy Efficiency Enhancement

The NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature is required for the operation of

this feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

UE with SDX-55 or later chipset model is required.

# 3 Feature Operation of CQI-Based UE Energy Efficiency Enhancement

The UE sends CQI and RI values in the scheduled CSI report. Depending on the reported

CQI and RI values, traffic stops or resumes on the SCells of the UE.

The UE overheating detection is based on link adaption data received in the CSI report

for the SCells of the UE on the SCG radio resource. The UE is in normal or overheated

state depending on the reported CQI and RI values.

While in the normal state, and if the Dynamic Component Carrier Management is enabled,

the feature continuously evaluates the data need and it might deactivate SCells when

they are not being utilized. In the overheated state, the SCells are not utilized but

they are kept activated nonetheless. This is required to receive the updated SCell CQI

values needed to leave the overheated state.

For more information on SCell deactivation, see Dynamic Component Carrier Management.

If the UE is configured with more than four component carriers, each report only contains

CQI values for some of the configured cells. This means that two reports are required to

trigger the transitions.

The CQI-Based UE Energy Efficiency Enhancement feature does not perform

buffer monitoring during UAI overheating, as SCells are deactivated. Monitoring starts

again when the UAI overheating is mitigated.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence

Diagram

1. If all SCells report 0 for CQI and 1 for RI (indicating two layers), the UE is considered overheated. In this state, no traffic is scheduled on the SCells which means that the UE can stop PDCCH monitoring. Note: This does not constitute as a 3GPP-defined SCell deactivation.
2. The CSI-RS downlink transmission for downlink link adaptation for the UE proceeds as normal. This means that the UE can measure the true CQI values for the SCells.
3. Once the UE reports that CQI is more than 0 on all its SCells, the UE is no longer considered overheated and SCell traffic resumes.

# 4 Network Impact of CQI-Based UE Energy Efficiency Enhancement

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
