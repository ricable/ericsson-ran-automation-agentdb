Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature only supports cell bandwidths below and equal to 20 MHz. The NR Large Bandwidth Support Low-Band feature must be

activated to allow the configuration of cell bandwidths above 20 MHz.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Physical Layer Low-Band

The Physical Layer Low-Band feature is involved in the operation of physical resources,

signals and channels.

Frame Structure

The Physical Layer Low-Band feature supports Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) downlink

and uplink assignment only. Downlink subframes are transmitted over downlink

carriers only, while uplink subframes are transmitted over uplink carriers.

## 3.1 Physical Resources

Physical resources concern information related to antenna ports, Resource Elements

and Resource Blocks. Characteristics of the NR cell and Bandwidth Parts (BWP) are also

described.

Antenna Port

An antenna port is defined by its associated channel or signal.

The supported set of antenna ports depends on the signal configuration in the

cell.

Resource Element and Resource Block

One OFDM symbol in a single subcarrier is called a Resource Element.

Resource Blocks describe the mapping of certain physical channels to Resource

Elements. A Resource Block is defined as 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency

domain.

NR Cell

The NR cell involves the following characteristics:

- Defined by the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) information
- Supports cell bandwidths up to 50 MHz

The PCI is for cell identification on the physical layer

and determined by the SSB. The UE uses the PCI to decode physical layer data

transmitted by the gNodeB.

The PCI of an NR cell is configured by using the

NRCellDU.nRPCI attribute.

The PCI must be planned to achieve dual connectivity and

optimal radio network performance. To avoid performance degradation, unique PCIs

must be configured within the same site and as neighbors and neighbors of

neighbors.

Bandwidth Parts

A Bandwidth Part (BWP) is a contiguous set of Resource Blocks. It entails the

following characteristics:

- A BWP is associated with a numerology.
- PxCCH, PxSCH, and DMRS within a bandwidth part share the same numerology.
- A UE is limited to one active bandwidth part at a time.

A BWP is defined to be equal to the cell bandwidth and only one BWP is supported in

each cell.

## 3.2 Physical Signals

Besides physical resources and physical channels, physical signals are also part of

the physical layer.

The downlink physical signals are shown in Table 2.

Table 2   Downlink Physical Signals

| Signal                                         | Low-Band      |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Demodulation Reference Signals                 | Supported     |
| Channel State Information Reference Signals(1) | Supported     |
| Phase Tracking Reference Signal                | Not supported |
| Tracking Reference Signals                     | Supported     |
| Primary Synchronization Signals                | Supported     |
| Secondary Synchronization Signals              | Supported     |

(1)

CSI-RS for channel acquisition is configured for the use

of TRS only.

The uplink physical signals are shown in Table 3.

Table 3   Uplink Physical Signals

| Signal                          | Low-Band      |
|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Demodulation Reference Signals  | Supported     |
| Phase Tracking Reference Signal | Not supported |
| Sounding Reference Signals      | Not supported |

### 3.2.1 Synchronization Signals

The Synchronization Signal and the PBCH Block constitute the SSB.

Synchronization Signal and PBCH Block

The SSB consists of the following signal types:

- Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS)
- Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS)
- PBCH (including DMRS)

The SSB features the following characteristics:

- The SSB periodicity can be configured with the NRCellDU.ssbPeriodicity attribute.
- One SSB occupies 20 Resource Blocks in frequency and four OFDM symbols in time.
- The numerology of the SSB depends on the frequency band. 15 kHz subcarrier spacing is supported.

NR cell search is based on the SSB. It involves the following functions:

- The UE performs matched filtering to find the PSS.
- The UE detects the SSS in the frequency domain.

The Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is for cell identification on the physical layer. It

is determined by the SSB. There are 3 x 336 = 1008 physical cell IDs in total.

### 3.2.2 Tracking Reference Signal

The feature uses TRS for synchronization. This signal type also provides information

related to channel estimation and demodulation. TRS periodicity can be configured with the

help of a dedicated attribute.

Unlike LTE, NR does not use the Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS). Hence, TRS is

introduced for fine synchronization to perform the following:

- Synchronization in time and frequency.
- Providing doppler and delay spread information required for channel estimation and demodulation.

TRS is realized using periodic CSI-RS resources. The periodicity of TRS can be

configured for each cell by the NRCellDU.trsPeriodicity attribute. In

each period, TRS is mapped to two symbols in two consecutive slots. The TRS power

relative to PDSCH is controlled by the NRCellDU.trsPowerBoosting

attribute. Power boosting is realized by the configuration of periodic ZP-CSI-RS

resources in the TRS symbols.

### 3.2.3 CSI Reference Signal

In addition to the CSI-RS resources configured for TRS,

CSI-RS is also configured for CSI acquisition.

A periodic four-port CSI-RS resource is configured for 4TX antenna channel measurements.

The period is configured by the NRCellDU.csiRsPeriodicity attribute.

The CSI-RS resource spans all of the Resource Blocks of the BWP. It occupies 1x4

Resource Elements in the slot of every Resource Block.

In addition to the CSI-RS, a CSI-IM resource with the same period is configured for

interference measurements. The CSI-IM resource spans all Resource Blocks of the BWP. It

occupies 2x2 Resource Elements in the slot of each Resource Block.

The CSI-RS is configured for 2TX and 4TX radios. Two-port CSI-RS is used for 2TX FDD

radios, an example is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Two-Port CSI-RS Configuration for 2TX FDD Radios

With 2TX radios, UEs are configured with the same two-port CSI-RS resources within a

cell.

Four-port CSI-RS is used for 4TX FDD radios, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Four-Port CSI-RS Configuration for 4TX FDD Radios

With 4TX radios, UEs are configured with the same four-port CSI-RS resources within a

cell.

Aperiodic CSI reporting is used, where the CSI report is

multiplexed on PUSCH. The UE is configured to report CSI according to the type 1

single-panel codebook. In addition, the wideband Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) and

the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) are used.

Two-port CSI-RS can be used to configure 1TX FDD radios, an example is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Two-Port CSI-RS Configuration for 1TX FDD Radios

### 3.2.4 Sounding Reference Signal

Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) resources are not triggered, as the network does not rely

on sounding measurement. However, these resources are defined to be aperiodic.

## 3.3 Physical Channels

The Physical Layer Low-Band feature specifies the function and use of control

channels and shared channels.

The following physical channels are specified to carry downlink control information for

NR:

- Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)
- Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)

For downlink data transmission, the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is used.

The following physical channels are specified to carry uplink control information for

NR:

- Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)
- Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)

For uplink data transmission, the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) is used.

### 3.3.1 Downlink Channels

PDCCH carries downlink control information, for example, scheduling assignments.

PDSCH carries the downlink transport block. PBCH carries part of the system information

required by the UE to access the network.

PDCCH

PDCCH carries the Downlink Control Information (DCI), mapped to PDCCH in the first

symbol in every downlink slot. This is realized by the configuration of a common

search space (CSS) and a UE-specific search space (USS). Both search spaces have a

monitoring periodicity of one slot with the duration of one symbol. This applies to

all supported bandwidths except for that of 5 MHz. Other bandwidths in non-ESS FDD

cells can also be exceptions when the NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid-Band feature is

enabled. For a comprehensive list of the bandwidths, see Feature Operation of NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols

Low/Mid-Band.

The supported aggregation levels of the PDCCH candidates depend on the cell

bandwidth, and can reach up to 16 Control Channel Elements (CCEs).

Downlink time and frequency resources for PDCCH are allocated in the form of a

Control Channel Resource Set (CORESET). In NR standalone deployment, the following

types of CORESET can be configured:

- CORESET#0 is configured for the CSS
- CORESET#1 is configured for the USS

In NR NSA, CORESET#0 is not configured for PDCCH, as LTE is used for common

control signaling. CORESET#1 is configured for both CSS and USS.

When the NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid-Band feature is

enabled, the configurations for CORESET and USS depend on the value set for the

NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute. For more information, see

NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid-Band.

PDCCH link adaptation is used to adjust the number of PDCCH CCEs dynamically. PDCCH

CCEs are allocated for DCI transmission in user-specific control signaling. The

number of CCEs transmitted for PDCCH are based on the channel quality.

PDSCH

PDSCH carries the downlink transport block, supporting up to 256-QAM and four SU-MIMO

layers on CPRI radios. Resource allocation is performed in the frequency domain

using type 0 resource allocation (bitmap). In the time domain, the resource

allocation of PDSCH is done by DCI in the same slot, using type A PDSCH mapping. The

PDSCH aggregation factor equals one. This means that a DCI schedules a PDSCH in one

slot only.

PBCH

Together with the PSS and the SSS, PBCH forms an SSB or PBCH block. The PBCH block is

part of the initial access procedure.

### 3.3.2 Uplink Channels

PUCCH carries uplink control information. PUSCH carries the uplink transport block

and uplink control information. PRACH is used for random access and allows the gNodeB to estimate the delay between itself and the UE.

PUCCH

PUCCH carries the following types of uplink control information:

- HARQ-ACKs and HARQ-NACKs
- Scheduling Requests (SRs)

One PRB is configured for PUCCH on both edges of the band for all 14 OFDM

symbols.

PUSCH

PUSCH carries the uplink transport block, supporting up to 256-QAM and one MIMO

layer, using the codebook-based transmission scheme. Transmission with transform

precoding disabled is supported. This means that the CP-OFDM waveform is used. For

resource allocation in the frequency domain, type 1 resource allocation (start or

length) is used. In the time domain, the resource allocation for PUSCH is performed

by DCI at least two slots in advance, using type A PUSCH mapping. The PUSCH

aggregation factor equals one, which means that the DCI schedules one PUSCH in one

slot only. IRC receiver processing is used to mitigate uplink interference.

PRACH

PRACH carries the RACH preamble sequences. PRACH can be

configured with the following characteristics:

- Preamble formats with different configurations: B4 with 15 kHz subcarrier spacing Format 0 with 1.25kHz subcarrier spacing Format 1 with 1.25kHz subcarrier spacing
- One RACH occasion every 10 ms
- 16 random access preambles in each RACH occasion

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
