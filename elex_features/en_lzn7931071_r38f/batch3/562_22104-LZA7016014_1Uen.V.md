# 1 Aggregated PM Events Overview

This feature reduces PM event volume by introducing time aggregated PM event

variants.

Summary

This feature introduces time aggregated variants of the PM Events that are otherwise

reported every 1 second. This will reduce the PM Event volume, especially benefiting

the receivers in a high traffic scenario.

Following time aggregated PM Event variants are supported:

- DuPerRadioUeMeasurementAggr60: Reported per UE per 60 seconds (could be used instead of DuPerRadioUeMeasurement, which is reported per UE per second).
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr60: Reported per DRB per UE per 60 seconds (could be used instead of DuPerUeRbTrafficRep, which is reported per DRB per UE per second).
- DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr60: Reported per UE per 60 seconds (could be used instead of DuPerUeTrafficRep, which is reported per UE per second).
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr10: Reported per DRB per UE per 10 seconds (could be used instead of DuPerUeRbTrafficRep, which is reported per DRB per UE per second).
- DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10: Reported per UE per 10 seconds (could be used instead of DuPerUeTrafficRep, which is reported per UE per second).
- CuUpPerUeRbCgTrafficRepAggr10: Reported per leg per UE per 10 seconds (could be used instead of CuUpPerUeRbCgTrafficRep, which is reported per leg per UE per second).
- CuUpPerUeRbS1NgTrafficRepAggr10: Reported per DRB per UE per 10 seconds (could be used instead of CuUpPerUeRbS1NgTrafficRep, which is reported per DRB per UE per second).

The main benefits of the feature are the following:

- The time aggregated PM could be activated in a PmEvent job instead of their 1 second reported PM Event counterpart to take advantage of lower event volume.
- The 10-second reported time-aggregated PM events reduce the overall event volume towards ENM applications.

# 2 Dependencies of Aggregated PM Events

Feature Dependencies

No dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Aggregated PM Events

The Aggregated PM Events feature will introduce time aggregated variants of the PM

Events that are otherwise reported every 1

second.

If 1 second reported PM events needs to be removed from CCTR event job(10005), then use

AMOS. Aggregated event variants shall be activated in an event job.

See Engineering Guidelines for Aggregated PM Events for information on AMOS commands.

Events

This feature introduces the following events:

- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr60
- DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr60
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr10
- DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10
- CuUpPerUeRbCgTrafficRepAggr10
- CuUpPerUeRbS1NgTrafficRepAggr10
- DuPerRadioUeMeasurementAggr10

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Aggregated PM Events

## 8.1 Modify PmEvent

To modify the PmEvent job to remove the three 1 sec event from CCTR with AMOS, do the

following:

Steps

1. Check existing events in the job with command pgets DU,EventJob=10005.
2. Redefine EventJob(10005) to except three 1 sec event using command pset DU,EventJob=10005 cctr.DuPerCellQosTrafficRep$|cctr.DuPerCellResourceRep$|cctr.DuPerCellTrafficRep$|cctr.DuPerNRCellDUDowntime$|cctr.DuPerRadioCellMeasurement$|cctr.DuProcUeContextModification$|cctr.DuProcUeContextSetup$|cctr.DuTestEventEnm$. Note: The character '$' should be added in the end of each event name. The AMOS command in step 2 can also be used to add the new aggregated events in the same job with this command pset DU,EventJob=10005 cctr.DuPerCellQosTrafficRep$|cctr.DuPerCellResourceRep$|cctr.DuPerCellTrafficRep$|cctr.DuPerNRCellDUDowntime$|cctr.DuPerRadioCellMeasurement$|cctr.DuProcUeContextModification$|cctr.DuProcUeContextSetup$|cctr.DuTestEventEnm$|proprietary.DuPerRadioUeMeasurementAggr60$|proprietary.DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr60$|proprietary.DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr60$. The preceding list of CCTR events is based on existing PM events assigned to CCTR event group. In future, if more PM events are assigned to CCTR event group then those events shall be included in the command (as necessary).
3. Check that EventJob(10005) is redefined correctly. Use command pgetsDU,EventJob=10005 to perform the check.

Results

Since the aggregated PM events are only in PROPRIETARY event group, the events will

not appear in CCTR group when pgets command is used for job 10005

after running the preceding command.

If needed, similar steps can be used to add three aggregated events in any other cell

trace job by using the job id of the specific job.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q4.0: Additional 10 Second time aggregated PM Event

Summary and Benefits

This feature introduces a new 10 second time aggregated PM Event

DuPerRadioUeMeasurementAggr10 which could be used instead of

its 1 second produced PM Event variant DuPerRadioUeMeasurement.

- PM Event DuPerRadioUeMeasurement is removed from the CCTR event group and instead new PM Event DuPerRadioUeMeasurementAggr10 is added to the CCTR event group.

Updated the existing 10 second time aggregated PM Event

CuUpPerUeRbCgTrafficRepAggr10 by adding new list event

parameters to report a list of corresponding 1 second event parameter values.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

After the software upgrade, it is recommended to stop the previous CCTR PM Event jobs

in existing nodes and restart again.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
