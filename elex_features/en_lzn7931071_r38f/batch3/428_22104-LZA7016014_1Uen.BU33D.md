Summary

The Zero Touch Integration feature can be used for the following use cases:

- Greenfield integration
- Expansion
- Baseband migration
- LTE radio access migration
- NR and NR in Mixed Mode with LTE radio access migration

With the Zero Touch Integration solution, most parts of baseband integration, expansion, or

migration can be prepared in advance. When a field technician is sent to site, the

only things that remain to be done are to install the hardware and then trigger the

already prepared software-related activities in a plug and play procedure.

For the baseband greenfield integration, migration, and expansion use cases, there is no need

to bring a laptop to site. Integration with ENM is done automatically once the node

is installed and powered on, or the maintenance button is pressed.

The LMT integration is supported, but no longer included in the feature.

# 2 Dependencies of Zero Touch Integration

The Zero Touch Integration feature has no hardware or network requirements and

limitations, but it is conflicting with another feature.

Hardware

No special hardware requirement is expected for this feature.

Limitations

Zero Touch Integration cannot be used in a network that is preconfigured using LAG

with LACP. LACP must be activated after all phases of the

Zero Touch Integration are completed.

Zero Touch Integration of baseband units is supported for greenfield and expansion

use cases. The expansion use case is also applicable to expanding radio and antenna

units connected to a baseband unit.

Zero Touch Integration is supported for the RDS using ECT. The number of Radio Dots

is fully controlled by the user, and the number of IRUs in fronthaul is limited to

one or two.

Zero Touch Integration for NR and LTE radio access migration is supported for RAN

Compute units in RAN Compute group 4, 5 and 6 if the following conditions are

met:

- The Radio Access Technology is supported by the hardware type.
- The hardware capacity is fulfilled.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Zero Touch Integration

## 3.1 Overview of Zero Touch Integration Phases

Figure 1   Zero Touch Integration Workflow

Network Provisioning - Prepare Network Infrastructure

In the network provisioning phase, the network infrastructure is set up. This is to

enable full connectivity between node site, network management system, as well as

core and transport networks.

One important aspect when setting up the network infrastructure is whether IPsec is

used or not. For more information on what needs to be considered when planning and

setting up a network infrastructure, see Integration Planning and Infrastructure

Guidelines.

Node Provisioning - Prepare Node Configurations

In the node provisioning phase, configuration template files as well as node-specific

configuration files are created. Usually, one configuration template file is created

per configuration type.

The configuration files typically specify:

- Site equipment
- Security, transport, and synchronization settings of node traffic
- Radio and transport network settings
- Information related to licensed features (license key file and activation settings)

Node Commissioning - Provide Node Configurations

The Node Commissioning phase includes:

- Storing node-specific configurations files in the Network Management System
- Downloading and storing software packages
- Binding the node hardware with the configuration data

Node Integration - Perform Autonomous Node Integration

Before node integration can start, the hardware for the node must be installed.

The integration process is initiated when the node is powered on at site and

continues automatically until the node is integrated in the network.

## 3.2 Tools Used in Zero Touch Integration

For details on tool support and what can be done in the different tools, see Integrate Baseband Radio Node or  Integrate Controller 6610 Node.

# 4 Network Impact of Zero Touch Integration

The expansion use case affects the traffic capacity. Zero Touch Integration affects the

O&amp;M network.

Capacity and Performance

The expansion use case affects the traffic capacity. Traffic is taken down during the

hardware installation.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Zero Touch Integration affects the O&amp;M network, the extent of the impact depends

on the number of nodes that are handled.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: NETCONF-Based Baseband Migration Support Using AMOS

| Feature Name:           | Zero                             Touch Integration   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0999                                         |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                                      |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                                         |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                  |
| Access Type:            | NR                                                   |

The feature enables one to one Baseband migration to a Baseband unit with support for

higher capacity. The supported migration use cases are the following:

- 5216 to 6641 or 6648
- 6630 to 6641 or 6648
- 6318 to 6337 or 6347

The feature enables most of the Baseband configurations to be re-used and transferred to

the new Baseband unit at migration. This means that the radio configuration is kept, and

existing radio equipment is attached to the new Baseband unit. During the migration, the

logical node identity is kept. An updated LKF file with new HWACs must be ordered for

the migration.

A TN port remapping is supported at the migration, since the new Baseband unit has a

different port setup. The migrated configuration is imported to ENM and a standard LMT

or ZT Autointegration procedure is used to integrate the new Baseband.

If a problem occurs, a manual rollback procedure to the old Baseband unit is

supported.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

Network Elements:

- ENM To be able to validate the new Baseband integration project, ENM needs to be updated to the same software and MOM version as the new Baseband unit. When ENM has an older SW or MOM, ECT is used to validate the integration files of the new Baseband unit. ENM must be disabled when ECT is used for validation

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q2: Zero Touch Integration Simplified Late Binding

This enhancement introduces the possibility to assign static IP addresses from DHCP

based on the node logical name instead of the node serial number. This functionality is

applicable for Zero Touch Integration process.

| Feature Name:           | Zero Touch Integration   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0999             |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node      |
| Access Type:            | NR, LTE, WCDMA, GSM      |

Benefits

If a logical name is assigned to the node, it can be specified as the client

identifier during the DHCP request. This enhancement makes static IP address

assignment easier because the operator does not need to obtain the node serial

number.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.c: 20.Q2: Pre-Check and Post-Check for HW Expansion

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement implements an automatic procedure to migrate the LTE RAN

from one radio node to another using a dedicated migration script, ECT standalone,

and standard ENM AP procedures. The CPRI links used by LTE radios are physically

moved from the source node to the target node. LTE RAN migration simplifies the

operation of moving an LTE configuration in between nodes. This can be utilized in

several cases including the following:

- Introduction of a new generation of node hardware such as capacity increase for RAN Compute units
- Re-framing or reorganization of RAN configurations on existing nodes

LTE migration is not supported for the following configurations:

- Cloud RAN deployments
- MORAN, MOCN, and configurations related to the radio access technology for these setups
- Switched Fronthaul configurations
- ESS configurations
- Elastic RAN (E-RAN) configurations for LTE

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The migration is performed by running a dedicated migration script in ENM and AMOS,

creating two delta configuration projects to be finalized in standalone ECT; one

project for each node to be changed. A standard ENM AP expansion project is then run

for each node. This results in the migrated radio access technology being deleted

from the source node and added to the target node.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

LTE migration is only supported for RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 3, 4, and

5. The following migration cases are supported for these groups:

- In any direction for units in the same RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 4 to RAN Compute group 4.
- To a later RAN Compute group, for example from RAN Compute group 3 to RAN Compute groups 4 and 5.

LTE migration is not supported for the following hardware types:

- 3PP radio units
- Indoor radio units, such as IRUs and RDs
- Cascaded equipment between baseband and radio units.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.4 or later is required for this feature enhancement. It is recommended

to use ENM version 23.1 or later for support of configuration validation with node

snapshot in ENM AP.

Source and target node RAN release 24.Q2 or later.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                 | Optional                 |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement implements an automatic procedure to migrate the NR RAN from

one radio node to another using a dedicated migration script, ECT standalone, and

standard ENM AP operations. As LTE migration is part of legacy support, both radio

access technologies can now be migrated independently using the same procedures. In

addition, NR and LTE RAN configurations can be migrated simultaneously from one node

to another.

The CPRI links used by NR and LTE radios are physically moved from the source node to

the target node. Radio access migration simplifies the operation of moving

configurations in between nodes and can be utilized in several cases, including the

following:

- Introduction of a new generation of node hardware such as capacity increase for RAN Compute units
- Re-framing or reorganization of RAN configurations on existing nodes on site

Radio access migration is not supported for the following configurations:

- Cloud RAN deployments
- MORAN, MOCN, and configurations related to the LTE radio access technology for these setups
- Switched Fronthaul configurations
- ULComp configurations
- Elastic RAN (E-RAN) configurations for LTE and Advanced RAN Coordination (ARC) for NR

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The migration is performed by running a dedicated migration script in ENM and AMOS,

creating two delta configuration projects to be finalized in standalone ECT; one

project for each node to be changed. A standard ENM AP expansion project is then run

for each node. This results in the migrated radio access technology being deleted

from the source node and added to the target node.
