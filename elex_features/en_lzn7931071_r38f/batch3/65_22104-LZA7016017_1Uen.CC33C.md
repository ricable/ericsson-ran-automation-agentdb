Summary

The Instantaneous Licensing feature is offered in two variants; connected mode and

non-connected mode. Both modes support the use of multiple

groupId for the Integration with Integration Unlock use case.

Both variants offer the following benefits:

- Faster lead time for Baseband Radio Node licensing requests.
- Less time needed for software package-related LKF updates.
- Entitlement activation based on actual node configuration.
- Lower risk of manual errors in the licensing process.

The feature supports the following Baseband Radio Node configurations:

- Single standard NR, LTE, WCDMA, GSM, Massive IoT, or Critical IoT nodes.
- Mixed mode nodes with all RAT combinations.

The feature supports the following price models:

- Throughput
- Antenna Bandwidth (ABW)
- Massive MIMO

Instantaneous Licensing in Connected Mode

The connected mode uses the Customer Access &amp; Security (CAS) implemented in the

network, to form an automated, secure solution, which allows the operator to

automatically request, receive and install License Key Files (LKF). The solution is

enabled with the support of the Customer Unit. The requests can be initiated by the

user from ENM, or directly from the node.

Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode supports the following use cases:

- Node integration: new nodes are integrated in the network.
- Software upgrade: an existing node is updated with new software.
- Capacity increase: additional capacity is added to the node.
- License refresh: an existing node is updated with a new LKF.
- Node expansion to support additional Radio Access Technology: an existing node is expanded with an additional Radio Access Technology, to facilitate Ericsson Spectrum Sharing.
- Hardware migration: an old Baseband unit is migrated to a new one.

Instantaneous Licensing in Non-Connected Mode

The non-connected mode automates license calculation and generation of License

Request File through SSP-LKM and ELIS, to simplify the overall process of obtaining

LKF without the need for CAS connections. In addition, file based LKF Upgrade and

Regenerate can be performed from SSP-LKM without LRF handling.

Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode supports the following use cases:

- Node integration: new nodes are integrated in the network.
- Capacity increase: additional capacity is added to the node.
- Node expansion to support additional Radio Access Technology: an existing node is expanded with an additional Radio Access Technology, to facilitate Ericsson Spectrum Sharing.
- Hardware migration: an old Baseband unit is migrated to a new one.
- Software upgrade: an existing node is updated with new software and changes in LCS and Fixed Profile configurations are handled through the SSP-LKM Upgrade option.
- License refresh: changes in LCS and Fixed Profile configurations are handled through the SSP-LKM Regenerate option.

# 2 Dependencies of Instantaneous Licensing

The Instantaneous Licensing feature has no dependencies to other

features.

Features

- Emergency Unlock Reset CXC is not supported. The emergency unlock reset key must be obtained manually.
- Instantaneous Licensing cannot be used for software upgrade, if the difference between the current and the target software is greater than 6 releases.
- Expansion to support GSM or WCDMA as Additional Radio Access Technology, might require node restart.
- Capacity expansion for GSM and WCDMA is not send automatically when required amount of output power HWAC and baseband HWAC is not increased.

Network Requirements

Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode:

- ENM version 22.2 or later.
- CAS-C software version 20.1.3 or later.

Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode:

- ENM version 22.1 or later.

# 3 Feature Operation of Instantaneous Licensing

The Instantaneous licensing feature automates license handling and is offered in two

modes: connected and non-connected.

The Instantaneous Licensing feature is handled through the

InstantaneousLicensing MO. For the feature to operate, the

required hardware, functions, and capabilities must be determined during the network

dimensioning phase. The completed purchase orders are stored by the ELIS Database as

entitlements.

The Instantaneous Licensing process involves the following components:

| Electronic                         License                         Information System (ELIS)   |    | ELIS is a web-based entitlement management system for software licenses                             and HWACs.  ELIS is used for activating licenses and HWACs and managing license                             pools. ELIS generates the License Authorization Code (LAC) letter and                             the requested LKF.  ELIS stores completed purchase orders for each customer based on their                             respective Software License Targets. ELIS is also used to handle LKF                             requests and to initiate the LKF delivery process.                                                                                                                          |

## 3.1 Instantaneous Licensing in Connected Mode

Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode fully automates license request, license

activation, LKF generation, and delivery from ELIS to the customer production network

through CAS.

LKF requests can also be manually initiated in the following ways:

- Using the Software and Hardware Manager (SHM) module of the ENM
- Using the CLI Module of ENM
- Issuing commands directly toward the Baseband Radio Node

The following use cases are supported in connected mode:

| Node Integration                                             |    | Configuration of the node to use Integration Unlock to                             request License Key File during the integration process.                             In                             case of Integration Unlock, generation and installation of the LKF is                             automated.  Alternatively, request of integration LKF is done                             before integration using ENM to get the LKF when there are new nodes to                             integrate into the network.   |

Auto-recovery Mechanism

If the LKF request fails because of the ENM connectivity problems, the system

automatically triggers LKF request retries. The retries are performed every hour

during the first 24 hours and every 24 hours afterwards.

If the LKF

request

fails

because of the

temporary

problems not

related with ENM connectivity, for example, the connectivity

problem between Ericsson and customer networks,

the

system automatically triggers a timer for retrying LKF

request. The retries are performed as following:

- Every 24 hours for a 7-day period when System Triggered Unlock is activated.
- Every 24 hours for a 21-day period when Integration Unlock is activated.
- Every 24 hours for a 7-day period for LKF Refresh and Feature Activation use cases.

## 3.2 Instantaneous Licensing in Non-Connected Mode

Instantaneous Licensing in non-connected mode does not require a CAS connection and

provides automated license calculation and generation of License Request File (LRF) that

simplifies the overall process of obtaining LKF using SSP-LKM and ELIS. Optionally, an

Excel file with fingerprints can be used as input for file-based

Upgrade and Regenerate in SSP-LKM,

removing the need for LRF handling and detailed feature activation lists.

The following use cases are supported in non-connected mode:

| Node Integration                                             |    | Configuration of the target node is done using Integration Unlock which grants license resources for 21 days. A                             manual trigger of the Radio Node License Request                                 Flow must be done in ENM Flow Automation to generate an                             LRF. Submitting the LRF to the                             SSP-LKM                             Activation action generates an LKF for the target                             node. The LKF must be installed manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## 3.3 Instantaneous Licensing with Support for GroupId during Node Integration

The use of multiple groupIds during node integration is supported by

Instantaneous Licensing in both connected and non-connected mode if the following

conditions are fulfilled:

- Node integration is performed using IntegrationUnlock.
- Multiple groupIds for each EUFT are used.

The use of groupId is mandatory for customers who maintain groups in

ELIS and it cannot be skipped during Integration with

IntegrationUnlock. If skipped, ELIS TH rejects the node with an

error. It is not recommended to use groupId if no groups are

maintained, as ELIS produces LKFs using the Default Group

category.

If these conditions are fulfilled, the following configuration rules apply during

integration:

- The swltId must be configured according to the pattern groupId&amp;&amp;lcsId, as it is the concatenation of the groupId and the LCS Id using &amp;&amp; as a separator. If the swltId is configured incorrectly, the integration LKF is not created. An example configuration of a swltId with grAB01 as groupId and lcsXYZ as LCS Id is: grAB01&amp;&amp;lcsXYZ Note: The groupId for a radio node must be obtained from the Customer Unit.
![Image](../images/65_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.CC33C/additional_3_CP.png)
- After the installation of the LKF, the swltId will be overwritten with the LCS and must not be reconfigured again on the radio node.
- There is no support for automatic change of groupId. If a change is required, it must be requested from the Customer Unit.

If the target software release for requested LKF is 6 releases

higher than active software release, or if the target software

release has not been released, then the LKF request fails in

ELIS.

# 6 Performance of Instantaneous Licensing

This feature has no impact on performance.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Instantaneous Licensing

This is a basic feature, but additional preparation is required to enable the

automated licensing solution in the network.

Activate the Instantaneous Licensing Feature

This is a basic feature. It does not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While optional features need to be activated, basic features are activated

automatically during node integration. They also do not have a software license key

associated, which means that they have no entries in the LKF that is installed on

the node.

It is possible that some functions of basic features need to be enabled or configured

manually.

Enable the Instantaneous Licensing feature in the Network

Both the connected and the non-connected mode of Instantaneous Licensing requires

additional configuration. The connected mode requires connectivity through CAS and a

number of preparation activities to be completed before it is fully operational. The

non-connected mode does not require connectivity through CAS. For more information,

see Engineering Guidelines for Instantaneous

Licensing.

Enable Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing on Node

### 8.2.1 Enable Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing on Node

The Baseband Radio Node must be configured to use the Instantaneous Licensing

feature.

Prerequisites

Before the feature can be used, the Instantaneous Licensing feature must be enabled

in the network. To use the Instantaneous Licensing feature, users must contact the

Customer Unit to ensure that the following requirements are met:

- The LCS and HCS definitions are set up in ELIS.
- The instantaneous licensing solution for CAS is set up and communication between ENM and CAS has been established.
- The feature is activated in ENM.

The feature must also be enabled through MO configuration. Before the feature is

enabled, attributes that belong to the InstantaneousLicensing MO

are configured in the following way:

Table 6   Attribute Values before Configuration

| Attribute                                  | Value      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| InstantaneousLicensing.administrativeState | LOCKED     |
| InstantaneousLicensing.operationalState    | DISABLED   |
| InstantaneousLicensing.availabilityStatus  | DEPENDENCY |

The following attributes must be configured when Integration Unlock is used to add

new node:

- InstantaneousLicensing.euft
- InstantaneousLicensing.swltId

Steps

1. Ensure that the following attributes are properly configured and the values are correct: InstantaneousLicensing.euft, which is the EUFT in the LCS definition. InstantaneousLicensing.swltId, which is the same as the LCS ID. InstantaneousLicensing.connectionMode, which must state CONNECTED\_MODE in order to use Instantaneous Licensing with node connected to ENM and ENM connected to ELIS.Note: LCS ID can be checked using the IL Manager tool.
2. Ensure that the following attributes are created and the values are correct: Https.nodeCredential Https.trustCategory Result: When correctly configured, the value of the InstantaneousLicensing.availabilityStatus attribute is changed to OFF\_LINE.
3. Set the value of the InstantaneousLicensing.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED. Result: The interface between the node and the ENM is activated and the attribute InstantaneousLicensing.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.

Summary and Benefits

With Feature Activation for Instantaneous Licensing, the node can send License Key

File (LKF) requests containing both capacity and feature keys to be activated on the

node. This prevents the over consumption of licenses and requires fewer License

Configuration Sets (LCS) to be created and maintained for each configuration

variant.

The enhancement introduces the following benefits:

- Improved governance of the LCS as fewer are required.
- Activation of features based on the actual demand of an individual node, rather than only on the predefined list in the LCS.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Information on the feature keys is included in the LKF request sent by the node. The

information is used to activate a set of features defined by Base Packages and Value

Packages the user is entitled to. The activation is handled through the

commercialState tag, set for a feature key.

The LKF may contain feature keys which may not be valid for a certain configuration

or hardware type. The user must ensure that only the supported feature keys are

activated on the node, to avoid errors.

The following, updated alerts, and alarms are now common for both capacity keys and

feature keys:

- License Additional Resources Request Sent Alert
- License Additional Resources Installed Alert
- License Additional Resources Request Failed

The following legacy alarms and alerts are no longer used:

- License Additional Capacity Resources Request Sent Alert
- License Additional Capacity Resources Installed Alert
- License Additional Capacity Resources Request Failed

A new alarm is introduced and raised when incompatible features are activated, or

when Instantaneous Licensing is not enabled properly:

- License Key not Activated

For more information on feature activation with Instantaneous Licensing, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation

Codes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The enhancement requires ENM version 22.3 or later.

Summary and Benefits

This enhancement enables fixed activation of selected License Objects and Radio HWAC

Objects based on LCS configuration.

Capacity and Performance

There is an impact on lead time for upgrade when LCS definition includes software

licenses with defined quantity configuration. The overall lead time for LKF delivery

during upgrade is expected to be longer. In case a new value package becomes

available in the target software release, the overall lead time is shorter, because

it is handled as a single Instantaneous Licensing transaction.

Summary and Benefits

The Instantaneous Licensing in Non-Connected Mode feature enhancement provides the

following benefits:

- Transparent and improved license key management solution that can be fully utilized by customers with minimal or no intervention from Ericsson side
- Automated calculation of required licenses and License Request File generation using ENM
- Increased security level as LKF packages are stored in SSP-LKM and accessed by Ericsson and customer in a secure way through a link to the SSP-LKF Portal using ELIS
- No need for Customer Access &amp; Security (CAS) connections.

Supported use cases:

- LKF for integration
- LKF for hardware migration
- LKF for feature activation
- LKF for capacity increase
- Expansion of a baseband radio node to support additional radio access technologies, such as from eNodeB to gNodeB and eNodeB node.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

- There is an operational impact coming from a fact that the LKF is delivered and installed after network operations of completed integration or expansion. License requests are manually stored and handled in SSP-LKM and updated LKFs are made available through a link to SSP-LKF Portal, which makes it possible to perform all licensing operations without the involvement of Ericsson support.
- enum LmActivationState is extended with additional state Unavailable. It impacts the following items for Instantaneous Licensing in both connected and non-connected mode: SystemTriggeredUnlock class is created by the system, no matter if Instantaneous Licensing Perpetual for RAN is present or not. An instance of this class is created when a node is upgraded to software version 24.Q1. This class is created with activationState=Unavailable by default. Integration Unlock has activationState=Unavailable when LKF is installed. When alarm License System Triggered Unlock Unavailable is present, SystemTriggeredUnlock is configured with activationState=Unavailable. Up until software version 22.Q4, the Inactive state was used.

Interfaces

No impact.

Summary and Benefits

The current method for managing upgrade and regeneration in IL non-connected mode

uses standard SSP-LKM requests. This process is conducted without incorporating

IL-specific logic as outlined by the IL Manager configuration. In this setup, new

value packages are not added to LKF, fixed profiles rules are not evaluated, and

updates to the License Configuration Set (LCS) are not applied. As a result,

creating LKFs for new software releases typically involves a two-step process of

upgrade and activation. When there are changes in the LCS, LKM Activation is

required, which is done based on manual input or an LRF generated through Flow

Automation in ENM.

This feature enhancement introduces the upgrade and regenerate options within

SSP-LKM, replacing the current two-step upgrade-activation method with a single LKM

IL Upgrade action, and LKM Activation with a more convenient LKM IL Regenerate

option. It also includes support for multiple

MeasCellGroup.groupId handling during integration with the

IntegrationUnlock MO, making the feature applicable to a

wider range of customers.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Activation of new value packages for a new software release can be done with a straightforward and error-free method using an Excel file-based SSP-LKM Upgrade action. A prerequisite for such a transaction is that new VPs are added to the LCS. If fixed profiles are used, the features are activated in the Ericsson Electronic Licensing Solution (ELIS). Without the use of fixed profiles, features are handled through the commercialState tag set in the LKF for a given feature key.
- Changes based on existing LCS and fixed profile configurations in IL Manager can be applied with a simplified Excel file based SSP-LKM Regenerate action.
- Regenerate can also be performed with a single fingerprint using the Single search based flow in the SSP-LKM GUI.
- Customers can handle multiple MeasCellGroup.groupId MOs for EUFTs during integration with IntegrationUnlock and use the benefits of Instantaneous Licensing.

Capacity and Performance

Impact on lead time for individual upgrade and regenerate use cases. The overall

effort and lead time is reduced by avoiding additional or more complex license

ordering actions.

Operation

If a new value package becomes available for a new software release, it must be added

to LCS, and optionally to fixed profiles before an upgrade is triggered from the

customer network. For integration of a radio node using multiple

MeasCellGroup.groupIds, the respective

MeasCellGroup.groupId must be configured in the radio node CM

data during initial node configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature is supported for all RAN Compute group units.

Other Network Elements

SSP-LKM Upgrade and Regenerate in non-connected mode IL requires Radio Node version

24.Q1.

Multiple MeasCellGroup.groupId handling during Integration with

IntegrationUnlock requires Radio Node version 23.Q2.

Operation

If the migration to Instantaneous Licensing non-connected mode solution requires LKF

clean-up activities, the license request file must be provided for each migrated

node.

If the migration to Instantaneous Licensing solution with the intention of full LKF

clean-up, the licenseDemandContent parameter is introduced and

must be set to FULL\_DEMAND through the Generate Radio

Node License Request File Flow in ENM Flow Automation for

non-connected Instantaneous Licensing or the

InstantaneousLicensing.refreshKeyFile MO action for connected

Instantaneous Licensing. When the licenseDemandContent

parameter is set to FULL\_DEMAND, the system triggers the node to

provide a full list of activated features.

The refreshStatus parameter is introduced under the

InstantaneousLicensing MO, presenting the same level of

information for LKF Refresh as for Capacity Expansion.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.
