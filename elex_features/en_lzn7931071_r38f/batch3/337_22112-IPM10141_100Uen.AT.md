# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 General

The NR Optical Fronthaul Solution Guideline introduces different fronthaul solutions for

NR and LTE site configurations, focusing on NR and the mixture of NR and LTE fronthaul

customer use cases.

This document provides the following types of information:

- Detailed information on relevant network designs for solution architects and field technicians performing node integration
- High-level overview of fronthaul transport solutions for managers, marketing and sales representatives, and customers

## 1.2 Scope

The document provides general fronthaul solutions and customer use cases based on

Fronthaul 6000 products. The scope of the document focuses on the following topics:

- Fronthaul 6000 solutions, including Fronthaul 6000 Active units and Fronthaul 6000 Passive units
- Specific customer use case study
- Network elements and SFP+/SFP28 selection

# 2 Terminology and Concepts

## 2.1 Fronthaul

Fronthaul networks enable the Baseband units to connect seamlessly to the radio units

without impacting radio performance. The fronthaul network supports high-performance

end-to-end solutions for low latency transport of CPRI or eCPRI.

Figure 1 shows the general fronthaul

structure.

Figure 1   General Fronthaul Structure

## 2.2 Centralized Radio Access Network

Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a proposed architecture for cellular

networks. With C-RAN, processing Baseband units are put in a hub site sharing the same

backhaul and power. The external radios are deployed on an antenna site with fronthaul

connection. Compared to Distributed RAN (D-RAN), C-RAN has the following advantages:

- Energy saving
- Low footprint
- Centralized maintenance
- Baseband pooling (reducing Baseband fragmentation)
- Spectrum efficiency

Furthermore, C-RAN allows a clear demarcation between Baseband units and external

radios with fronthaul transport units located in the middle.

## 2.3 Optical Pluggable Transceivers

The optical pluggable transceivers are divided into three groups based on the following

functions:

- Client-side SFP+ or SFP28 Used with Baseband units, external radios, and the respective side of the fronthaul transponder to Baseband units and external radios. Colored or gray, bidirectional SFP+ or SFP28 is supported.
- Line side SFP+ or SFP28 Used by Baseband units, external radios, or fronthaul transponders to fronthaul passive multiplexing (MUX) and demultiplexing (DEMUX) filters. 10-Gigabit Colored SFP+ or 25-Gigabit SFP28 is supported for Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM).
- Optical Supervision Channel (OSC) SFP+ Used at antenna site fronthaul transponders for remote management. Colored or gray, bidirectional SFP+ is supported.

The selection of different SFP+ or SFP28 is based on the functions and on the

corresponding Baseband unit, external radios, and the transponder requirements. The

requirements can be the following:

- SFP+ or SFP28 capability of supported maximum distance
- Latency
- CPRI or eCPRI capacity of 1-Gigabit Ethernet, 10-Gigabit Ethernet, or 25-Gigabit Ethernet
- Power consumption
- Wavelength and temperature adaptation

The narrowband-tunable SFP28 RDH102408 can be applied in both indoor and outdoor

environment. Compared to the distance of 10 km of DWDM fixed frequency SFP28,

narrowband-tunable SFP28 can reach the maximum distance of 15 km, and it can adapt eight

variants. The installation is simple, therefore OPEX and TCO can be reduced.

The fullband tunable SFP28 RDH102409 can be applied in

passive solution for supported AIR and Baseband types. For more available modules, see

SFP Module Selector Guide  in the NR RAN library.

The fronthaul solution can support a maximum distance of 15 km. Selecting the SFP+ or

SFP28 based on the following distances is recommended:

- More than or equal to 10 km, suitable when the external radio is far away from the Baseband site.
- Less than 10 km, suitable when the external radio is close to the Baseband site.

Table 1 shows the SFP+ and SFP28 types used

for fronthaul products.

(1)

The RDH product supports maximum 20 kilometers or 40

kilometers. The allowed maximum distance between Baseband

and Radio is 15 kilometers because of latency

requirements.

(2)

The '--' indication of the product number represents the

product variant number and is a series of digits in a range

of 14-61.

(3)

For Fixed Frequency SFP28, the maximum distance is 10

kilometers because of chromatic dispersion. For SFP+ and

Narrowband-Tunable SFP28, the maximum distance is 15

kilometers because of the Baseband-Radio connection latency

requirements.

(4)

The "--" refers to eight variants of auto-tuning on 48 DWDM

frequencies, each variant in each of the following

subbands:

- A
- B
- C
- D
- E
- F
- G
- H

The variants are as follows:

- 14
- 20
- 26
- 32
- 38
- 44
- 50
- 56

For detailed information on the variants, see

Fronthaul 6000.

(5)

When used with an active or passive Fronthaul, to use the 25G

capability of SFP28, Baseband 6648, and 25G capable AIR are

recommended.

For more information, see the following documentation:

- For the SFP+ or SFP28 types used for fronthaul units, see System Characteristics Description in the Ericsson Fronthaul 6000 library.
- For the SFP+ or SFP28 types used for Baseband and external radios, see SFP Module Selector Guide in the NR RAN library.
- For the SFP+ or SFP28 types used for Router 6000, see Transceivers in the Router 6675 library.

The Gray SFPs are needed in Active, Semi-Active, and Semi-Passive solutions, while the

Colored SFPs are used in all solutions:

- For Passive Solution, Colored SFPs are plugged in Baseband units (in Hub Site) and in radio units (in Antenna Site). No Gray SFPs are needed. Figure 2 Passive Solution
- For Active Solution, Colored SFPs are plugged in fronthaul units (both in Hub Site and Antenna Site). Gray SFPs are used to connect fronthaul units to Baseband units (in Hub Site) and radio units (in Antenna Site) respectively. Figure 3 Active Solution
- For Semi-Passive Solution, Colored SFPs are plugged in fronthaul units (in Hub Site) and in radio units (in Antenna Site). Gray SFPs are used to connect fronthaul units to Baseband units in Hub Site only.
- For Semi-Active solution, Colored SFPs are plugged in Baseband units (in Hub Site) and in fronthaul units (in Antenna Site). Gray SFPs are used to connect fronthaul units to radio units (in Antenna Site). Figure 4 Semi-Active Solution

## 2.4 Fronthaul Hardware Components

The Fronthaul hardware components are divided into the following groups:

- Active units
- Passive units

In the passive Fronthaul solution, only passive units are used. In the active,

semi-active, or semi-passive Fronthaul solution, both active units and passive units are

used.

Active units have a power supply and running software. According to the solutions adopted

(active, semi-passive, or semi-active), active units are located at hub sites, antenna

sites, or both. In the active solution, the Fronthaul units at the remote site are

automatically discovered by the Fronthaul 6000 unit equipped in the hub site, acting as

the controller unit.

Passive units are WDM filters and splitters that do not require any power supply. They

have no running software and no communication with the Fronthaul 6000 controller unit.

In the active, semi-active, or semi-passive solutions, they can also be created manually

and managed in the OAM database to provide equipment information.

For detailed information about active and passive units, see Fronthaul 6000 Active

Technical Product Description and Fronthaul 6000 Passive Technical

Product Description in the Ericsson Fronthaul 6000 library.

## 3.1 Baseband and Radio Product

For detailed information about the capacity of hardware units used in this guideline, see

the following documents:

- For baseband units: DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN
- For radio units: Supported Radio Capabilities Radio Configurations for NR

# 4 Fronthaul Solution Overview

Fronthaul 6000 is a series that supports high-performance end-to-end solutions for

low-latency transport of CPRI or eCPRI. The series consists of Fronthaul 6000 Active

Units and Fronthaul 6000 Passive Units solutions.

For more information, see the Ericsson Fronthaul

6000 library.

The following fronthaul solution variants can be deployed:

- Active solution: a management unit and transponders can provide complete and dedicated management and monitoring functions.
- Passive solution: only passive equipment which does not require any power supply to decrease the OpEx and CapEx.
- Semi-active solution: active equipment at the antenna site and passive equipment at the hub site. Only antenna sites contain transponders to the management unit. The hub sites are equipped with passive filters to save cost and footprint.
- Semi-passive solution: active equipment at the hub site and passive equipment at the antenna site. OAM access is only available at the hub site for management and control functions.

## 4.1 Active Fronthaul Solution

The active fronthaul solution is selected because it provides the following benefits:

- Clear demarcation between the sites and the transport domain
- High capacity and management function at the hub site
- Possibility of data collection at the antenna site to monitor the status of fiber and optical power

### 4.1.1 Case 1: Outdoor Fronthaul 6020 for LTE, NR Mid-Band and High-Band with Linear Configuration

Deployment Scenario

This case describes a site configuration with the following scenarios:

- Antenna site deployed with external radios with LTE traffic
- Antenna site deployed with AIR 6488 with NR mid-band traffic
- Antenna site deployed with AIR 5331 with NR high-band traffic

Active Fronthaul 6020 Topology

In this example, each external radio with LTE traffic needs one CPRI, the AIR 6488

with NR mid-band traffic needs two eCPRI connections, and AIR 5331 with NR high-band

traffic needs four CPRI connections. One Baseband 5216 is provided to connect three

external radios with LTE traffic. One Baseband 6630 is provided to connect three AIR

6488 units and one Baseband 6630 connects one AIR 5331.

Figure 5 shows an example configuration of

the RAN and fronthaul products, and the deployment and connection at both the hub

and antenna sites.

Figure 5   Active Fronthaul 6020 Topology

Because of the requirements for high capacity and status monitoring, standard gray

SFP+ is equipped in Baseband units, external radios, and the client side of the

fronthaul transponder. Colored SFP+ is used in the line side of the fronthaul

transponders to the respective passive filters.

Active Fronthaul 6020 Configuration

Figure 6 shows the detailed configuration

where the combination of Fronthaul 6622 and the passive filter OMD-24-S is deployed

at the hub site.

Figure 6   Active Fronthaul 6020 Configuration

The outdoor Fronthaul 6322 is installed at the antenna site. Both the hub and antenna

sites need gray SFP+ to connect fronthaul transponders to the Baseband units and

external radios.

Because of the high capacity, 10-Gigabit Ethernet LTE and NR ports are required.

Short distance fiber deployment (less than 1 km) is enough for the connections

between the Baseband units, external radios, and fronthaul equipment at each site.

Gray SFP+ RDH 102 65/2 (10-Gigabit Ethernet, 1.4 km) and colored SFP+ RDH 102 406/--

(10-Gigabit Ethernet) are recommended.

Benefit

The active solution has the following benefits compared to a passive solution:

- Easy installation at the antenna site using Fronthaul 6322.
- Remote management and monitoring of the fronthaul network.
- 21 fiber pairs are combined into one single strand fiber.
- High-capacity Fronthaul 6322 can support up to nine CPRI or eCPRI ports in any ratio. All ports support SFP, SFP+, and all bit rates up to 11.1 Gbps.

### 4.1.2 Case 2: Outdoor Fronthaul 6020 for NR High-Band

Deployment Scenario

For NR high-band (mmW) deployment, AIR 5331 at the antenna site and Baseband 6630 at

the hub site are needed. Because of the bandwidth variations of AIR 5331, different

Baseband units are needed, for detailed information see NR NSA Connectivity Guideline with Option 3x. In this

case, AIR 5331 is pole mounted and four CPRI ports are used. For a three-sector

site, three AIR 5331 units are deployed and connected to three Baseband 6630 units

in a total of 12 fiber pairs of 10G CPRI gray SFP.

As a prerequisite for Case 2, the existing connectivity site must remain the same.

The number of fiber pairs to the site is insufficient for the new NR connectivity.

For the deployment, a clear demarcation is needed between the RAN and the fiber

optical network, using gray SFP+ on the radio equipment and on the Baseband

unit..

The optical network must be high-capacity and easy to reconfigure with a Remote

Monitoring function and management supervision. Therefore, an active Fronthaul 6020

solution is selected. The solution allows standard gray SFP+ on Baseband 6630, AIR

5331, and on the client side of Fronthaul 6322 to the RAN equipment. Colore SFP+ is

equipped at the line side of Fronthaul 6622 for WDM use.

Active Fronthaul 6020 Topology

Figure 7 shows the RAN and fronthaul product,

deployment, and the CPRI channels connected at the hub and antenna sites. Gray SFP+

is used between the Baseband unit, external radio, and the fronthaul transponders.

Colored SFP+ is used at the line side of fronthaul transponders.

Figure 7   Active Fronthaul 6020 Topology

Active Fronthaul 6020 Configuration

Figure 8 shows the specific RAN and fronthaul

equipment used for the solution. Fronthaul 6622, combined with management and

transponder modules, and DWDM filter OMD-24-S are set at the hub site. Fronthaul

6322, combined with the DWDM filter and transponder modules, is deployed at the

antenna site.

Figure 8   Active Fronthaul 6020 Configuration

In this case, AIR 5331 is pole mounted and four CPRI ports are used.Since Baseband

units and AIR units are mostly close to the fronthaul transponders at the hub or

antenna sites, the short distance gray SFP+ RDH 102 65/2 (1.4 km) is recommended.

Colored SFP+ RDH 102 406, which is capable of 10 Gbps and can be used in a wide

temperature range (from -40-85°C), is recommended for the line side of Fronthaul

6622 and Fronthaul 6322.

### 4.1.4 Case 4: Outdoor Fronthaul 6020 for LTE, NR Mid-Band and High-Band with Point to Multipoint Deployment

Deployment Scenario

Case 4 has a general configuration with external radios with LTE traffic, and AIR

units with NR mid-band and high-band traffic. It supports both Active Fronthaul

Service (gray lines) and Passive Fronthaul Service (colored lines) to the hub site

and the antenna site. It does not need an extra passive fronthaul device (for

example, an OMD-24-S) at the hub site to convert all the gray and colored interfaces

into one single-strand fiber. This case is suitable for the scenario where colored

interfaces are already deployed and new gray interfaces need to be deployed based on

the color interfaces.

In this case, there are two types of Fronthaul 6624. One is installed with

OAD-9-2S-LB (low band) and the Fronthaul 6620 base unit. The other is installed with

an OAD-12-S-HB (high band) and the Fronthaul 6620 base unit. The Fronthaul 6620 base

unit is an indoor transponder supporting up to 12 services. This unit is provided

with a cassette slot to equip an OAD-9-2S-LB (or OAD-9-2S-HB ) or an OAD-12-S-HB (or

OAD-12-S-LB). OAD-9-2S-LB means it supports the low band B, C, D of the frequency

spectrum. OAD-12-S-HB means it supports the high band E, F, G, H of the frequency

spectrum. For detailed information of the fronthaul band of frequency spectrum, see

the Ericsson Fronthaul 6000 library.

At the Hub site, the Fronthaul 6624 with an OAD-9-2S-LB can provide 18 services and

two DWDM lines to two distinct antenna sites. The Fronthaul 6620 base unit has a

12-channel transponder. This way, 12 of the 18 services can go through transponders

for gray-color conversion. The other six services directly connect to the filters.

The Fronthaul 6624 with an OAD-9-2S-LB can support up to 12 Active Fronthaul

Services (gray lines) and up to six Passive Fronthaul Service (colored lines) to the

two antenna sites. For the Fronthaul 6624 with an OAD-12-S-HB, the 12 services go

through the transponders for gray-color conversion. It provides 12 Active Fronthaul

Services (gray lines) to the antenna site through one DWDM line.

At the antenna site, the Fronthaul 6322 is an active remote outdoor unit with

transponders and filters. It has transponder functions that support up to nine

services. AIR units with NR mid-band and high-band traffic are connected to the

Fronthaul 6322 with gray SFP+. The external radio with LTE Traffic is connected to

the Fronthaul 6322 with colored SFP+. The services coming from AIR units with NR

traffic go through the transponders, while the services from external radios with

LTE Traffic connect directly to the filters.

products, the deployment, and the connections configured at both the hub and the

antenna sites.

(1)

The '--' indication of the product number represents the

product variant number and is a series of digits in a

range of 14-61.

Benefits

This solution has the following benefits compared to a passive solution:

- Remote management and monitoring for the fronthaul network.
- 6 Passive Fronthaul Service (colored line) pairs and 24 Active Fronthaul Service (gray line) pairs are combined as three strand fibers.
- Fronthaul 6322 can support the antenna site with both colored and gray fiber SFP+.
- Fronthaul 6624 can support one hub site with both colored and gray fiber SFP+.
- At the hub site, when a Fronthaul 6624 is used as an active device, it has the function to converge the fiber services. The active fronthaul devices need an extra passive fronthaul device for the same functionality.

## 4.2 Passive Fronthaul Solution

Passive Fronthaul solutions can be selected for the following reasons:

- A passive solution can transport up to 24 services over one single strand fiber. It can meet the requirement of less cost, the footprint is significantly reduced compared to Active Fronthaul solution.
- Passive fronthaul units do not need power consumption.

### 4.2.1 Case 1: Indoor Fronthaul 6080 for NR High-Band

Deployment Scenario

For NR high-band (mmW) deployment, an AIR 5331 at the antenna site and a Baseband

6630 at the hub site are needed. The selection of the AIR is based on the number of

CPRI ports needed. The number of CPRI ports scale with the carrier bandwidth and the

number of radio branches. In this case, all four CPRI ports of the AIR 5331 are

used. For a three-sector site, three AIR 5331 units are deployed and connected to

three Baseband 6630 units in a total of 12 fiber pairs (3 AIRs × 4 CPRIs × 2 fibers

per CPRI = 24 fibers) of 10G CPRI colored SFP+.

Figure 13   Passive Fronthaul 6080 Solution

Passive Fronthaul 6080 Topology

Figure 14 shows the network topology deployed

between the hub and antenna sites. It indicates which RAN and fronthaul equipment is

used. It also shows how to deploy them and the total CPRI channels required by

corresponding Baseband and external radios. Colored SFP+ is equipped at both hub and

antenna sites. For a low cost, high capacity optical network with single strand

fiber installation and configuration, outdoor installed equipment at the antenna

site is needed. The passive Fronthaul 6000 solution is selected to meet these

requirements.

Figure 14   Passive Fronthaul 6080 Topology

Passive Fronthaul 6080 Configuration

Figure 15 shows the specific Baseband unit,

external radio, and fronthaul equipment types, quantities, and respective connection

sets. Each CPRI channel between Baseband 6630 and AIR 5331 requires a pair of

colored SFP+ (with fixed lambdas and wavelengths) for upstream and downstream

traffic. AIR 5331 has high capacity ports (10 GB) and is installed outdoors.

Therefore, I-Temp colored SFP+ RDH 102 406 (capable of 10 GB and wide temperature

range from -40-85°C) is recommended.

- Easy installation and deployment with only colored SFP+ equipped on Baseband units and external radios (gray SFP+ is saved).
- 23 fibers are saved between the hub and the antenna sites.

### 4.2.2 Case 2: Outdoor Fronthaul 6080 for NR High-Band

Deployment Scenario

This case has a linear configuration with passive Fronthaul 6080. Fronthaul 6681 is

used at the hub site to provide 24 CPRI services. The following devices are used at

the antenna sites:

- Fronthaul 6585
- Fronthaul 6387
- Fronthaul 6389

Fronthaul 6585 includes one OAD-3-S to provide three CPRI services, Fronthaul 6387

includes two OAD-3-S to provide six eCPRI services, and Fronthaul 6389 includes one

OAD-9-S and one OAD-3-S to provide 12 CPRI services. In the example, external radio

with LTE Traffic has one CPRI fiber pair connected, the AIR 6488 with NR mid-band

traffic has two eCPRI fiber pairs connected, and the AIR 5331 with NR high-band

traffic has four CPRI fiber pairs connected.

Figure 16 shows the network deployment. At the

hub site, the Baseband unit connects to the Fronthaul 6681 through the Passive

Fronthaul Service (colored lines). At the antenna sites, the following devices are

deployed in a linear configuration:

- Fronthaul 6585
- Fronthaul 6387
- Fronthaul 6389

Each of the following outdoor fronthaul devices (6585, 6387 or 6389) are equipped at

an individual site:

- Fronthaul 6585
- Fronthaul 6387
- Fronthaul 6389

Each individual site is connected through a single strand fiber.

The '--' indication of the product number represents the

product variant number and is a series of digits in a

range of 14-61.

Benefits

The solution has the following benefits compared to an active solution:

- Low cost and power consumption with pure passive fronthaul equipment used at both the hub and the antenna sites.
- Easy installation and deployment with only colored SFP+ equipped on Baseband units and external radios.
- 21 fiber pairs are combined as one single strand fiber.

### 4.2.3 Case 3: Outdoor Fronthaul 6080 for LTE, NR Mid-Band and High-Band

Deployment Scenario

This case is a high capacity passive solution. It provides a mixture configuration

with the following types of the Baseband and radio units:

- 25G-capable Baseband 6648 with NR traffic and 10G-capable Baseband 5216
- AIR 6488 and AIR 3236 with NR Mid-Band Traffic
- External radio with LTE Traffic Radio 8836 and Radio 2217

Each antenna site has different AIR units installed, for example, the LTE antenna

site with Baseband R503 has three groups of LTE radios, where each group has

different frequency spectrum respectively. These external radios with LTE traffic

connect to the same Fronthaul 6387, located in the same area.

At the hub site, two 25G-capable Fronthaul 6683 units are installed. Each Fronthaul

6683 has one OAD-9-2S-LB equipped to provide 18 services, and it has two DWDM lines

to the distinct antenna sites. It is a high-density solution because 4 × OAD-9-2S-LB

can be installed in one half depth rack unit to provide 72 services. For one depth

rack unit, it could provide up to 144 services with 8 × OAD-9-2S-LB.

At the antenna site, 25G-capable Fronthaul 6587 or 10G-capable Fronthaul 6387 units

are installed at four antenna sites. Fronthaul 6587 and Fronthaul 6387 both have one

OAD-9-S to provide up to nine services.

Passive Fronthaul 6080 Topology

Figure 18 shows the network topology deployed

between the hub and antenna sites. The first and second antenna site connects to the

same Baseband 6648 with NR traffic, but are in different locations to save Baseband

resource.

The antenna sites have the following topology:

- First antenna site: Fronthaul 6387 connects to three AIR 6488 units, each AIR 6488 has two 10G eCPRI connections.
- Second antenna site: three AIR 3229 connected to Fronthaul 6587, each AIR 3229 has one 25G eCPRI connection.
- Third antenna site: three Radio 8836 connected to Fronthaul 6387, each Radio 8836 has one 10G CPRI connection.
- Fourth antenna site: each Baseband R503 is connected to Fronthaul 6387 with one 10G CPRI connection, and each Baseband R503 has three 2.5G CPRI connections with the external radios with LTE traffic. There are three Baseband R503 units and accordingly nine external radios with LTE Traffic installed at the antenna site. Baseband R503 is used for RI extension.

Deployment Scenario

This case is a high-density configuration, which is installed with one OAD-9-S-LB and

one OAD-9-S-HB. It can provide up to 18 services. This case can be applied to two

operators that share the fiber infrastructure, the traffic for the two operators is

protected at physical level as transported onto two (or more) completely segregated

frequencies despite running on the same fiber.

At the hub site, there are two stacked Fronthaul 6683. One is equipped with

OAD-9-S-LB and the other is equipped with OAD-9-S-HB. The OAD-9-S-LB supports Band

B, C, D while the OAD-9-S-HB supports Band E, F, G. For details refer to

Fronthaul 6000 Active Technical Product Description in Ericsson

Fronthaul 6000.

The two operators connect to different Fronthaul 6683 respectively. Two single strand

fibers connect the hub site and the antenna site. At the antenna site, each

Fronthaul 6389 has one OAD-9-S-LB or one OAD-9-S-HB equipped, which belong to

different operators.

### 4.2.5 Case 5: Outdoor Fronthaul 6080 for Small Cell Rollouts

Deployment Scenario

The

passive

fronthaul with small cell rollouts can be

installed

quickly and

cost-effectively.

Especially in dense urban

areas,

where small cell solution is visually unobtrusive and can be

quickly approved by aesthetic regulations.

In this case,

the

Enclosure 6514 is installed at

the

antenna site.

It

is a single

enclosure

composed

of

up to

four

micro radios. The radios and

the

Fronthaul 6585 are pre-integrated into the enclosure.

The

rollouts can

be

fast by reducing the installation time and cost.

For a typical small cell deployment, it can have three or four micro radios,

for

example, two 2T2R radios plus one 4T4R radio or four 2T2R

radios.

Passive Fronthaul 6080 Topology for Small Cell Rollout

Figure 22 shows

the small cell topology. The Enclosure 6514 is the only unit installed at the remote

site. The integrated Fronthaul 6585 can multiplex nine colored duplex radio signals

within one strand fiber. If more capacity is required, the OAD-9-S-LB and the

OAD-9-S-HB can be cascaded up to 18 services.

The '--' indication of the product number represents

the product variant number and is a series of digits

in a range of 14-61.

Benefits

The solution has the following benefits compared to an active solution:

- No power consumption in this passive solution.
- High capacity, low footprint, cost efficient and easy installation.
- Fast scale-up in the dense urban area.

## 4.3 Semi-Active Fronthaul Solution

Semi-active Fronthaul solution is selected for the following reasons:

- At the antenna site, an active fronthaul unit is installed to manage and monitor the fronthaul transport networks.
- At the hub site, a passive fronthaul unit is installed for high capacity, low footprint, and cost saving.

### 4.3.1 Case 1: Indoor Fronthaul 6020 for LTE and NR High-Band

Deployment Scenario

The scenario is NR Mid-Band deployment in an existing LTE site.

For NR deployment, AIR 6488 is used at the antenna site and Baseband 6630 is used at

the hub site. One Baseband 6630 is connected with three AIR 6488 units. Each AIR

6488 has two eCPRI ports connected. Gray SFP+ is used in the AIR with NR traffic and

the client side of fronthaul transponder. Colored SFP+ is used at the fronthaul line

side. Furthermore, one additional fiber pair with bidirectional SFP+ is used to

provide remote management for Fronthaul 6622.

For the existing LTE deployment, nine external radios (to support three different

bands) are equipped at one antenna site, and three external radios are connected to

one Baseband 5216. This means that nine fiber pairs are required to connect the

external radios to the Baseband units. Colored SFP+ is used in both the Baseband

units and the external radios.

15 (nine for LTE and six for NR) fiber pairs are needed to connect to the RAN nodes.

The Fronthaul 6020 semi-active solution is selected to deploy a low-cost fronthaul

solution with fiber power monitoring and alarm reporting at antenna site. Fronthaul

6622 is connected with DWDM filter OMD-24-S is set at the antenna site, and DWDM

filter OMD-24-S is at the hub site. Fiber pairs are used for external radio units

with LTE or NR traffic with colored or gray SFP+, one single fiber is used for

management with BiDi SFP+. The number of fibers used between the hub and the antenna

sites is reduced to be one single strand fiber. Furthermore, the filters (OMD-24-S)

are doubled for in-service upgrades.

Figure 24   Semi-Active Fronthaul 6020 Solution

Semi-Active Fronthaul 6020 Topology

Figure 25 shows the RAN and fronthaul

products, deployment, and the connection set at both the hub and the antenna

sites.

The LTE and NR parts are combined for the solution in the following way:

- For the LTE part, only fronthaul passive solution is used where colored SFP+ is equipped in Baseband 5216 and in the external radio with LTE traffic.
- For the NR part, semi-active fronthaul solution is used where colored SFP+ is equipped in Baseband 6630 and the line side of Fronthaul 6622. Gray SFP+ is used in NR and the client side of Fronthaul 6622. Bidirectional SFP+ can be used in Router 6000 and Fronthaul 6622 for remote management.

Figure 25   Semi-Active Fronthaul 6020 Topology

Semi-Active Fronthaul 6020 Configuration

Figure 26 shows the LTE and NR RAN, fronthaul

equipment, and the detailed interconnection set. To simplify the selection of

colored SFP+ with high capacity (10 GE) at a low price, I-Temp colored SFP+ RDH 102

406 is recommended. I-Temp colored SFP+ RDH 102 406 is equipped in external radios

with LTE traffic, Baseband 5216, Baseband 6630, and Fronthaul 6622. Short distance

gray SFP+ RDH 102 65/2 (1.4 km) is recommended to connect AIR units with NR traffic

and Fronthaul 6622. Bidirectional SFP+ RDH 102 70/1 and RDH 102 70/2 are used in

Router 6000 (Router 6672 or Router 6675) and Fronthaul 6622 for remote

management.
