Hardware

The feature can be activated on all radio units which support High-Band.

In single sector deployments, the configuration of four uplink

sector carriers for each PSCell over eight uplink sector carriers is supported for

all radio units, except for AIR 5121.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the feature:

- Only contiguous carriers are supported.
- A maximum of four NR carriers are aggregated.
- Uplink carrier aggregation requires a sufficient number of uplink sector carriers to be configured. For more information, see DU and Baseband Configuration and Capacity.

Network Requirements

The feature is only supported in high-band.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature aggregates up to

four carriers for higher uplink throughput.

Operational Process

The feature is configured during the initial setup of SCG

radio resources.

All devices within the same coverage area use the same cell as PSCell. The cell with

the lowest ARFCN that is also uplink-capable is selected as the PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is used,

each

sector is configured with two PSCells.

The SCell selection algorithm maximizes the number of aggregated carriers and

configures up to two MIMO layers for each sector carrier. The

SCell selection algorithm takes into consideration the supported SCG configuration

of the UE and the cells configured by the Secondary Node.

Link adaptation is performed on each carrier. The Scheduler High-Band feature uses all

component carriers to maximize throughput in each uplink slot.

The number of aggregated carriers depends on the UE

capability and on the number of Secondary Node-configured cells.

It is possible to use the same bandwidth or mixed bandwidths in a

carrier aggregation configuration. 50 MHz and 100 MHz bandwidths are supported.

The supported total aggregated bandwidth is 400 MHz. For example,

the following configurations are supported:

- Two to four 50 MHz carriers
- Two to four 100 MHz carriers
- One 50 MHz carrier and one to three 100 MHz carriers

SCG Configuration Selection in the Secondary Node

The Secondary Node selects an SCG configuration, supported both by the UE and the NR

cells, that maximizes the aggregated bandwidth.

## 3.1 SCell Configuration and Link Scheduling

SCell Configuration

SCells are configured with blind selection. All configured cells in the Secondary

Node that are not PSCells can be SCell candidates.

An SCell configured for both uplink and downlink traffic is a candidate for uplink

aggregation. A maximum of three SCells can be configured for

uplink and downlink traffic for each sector.

Once an SCell is configured for a UE, the configuration remains until the SCG radio

resources are released.

SCell Activation

Initially only the PSCell is activated. SCells are activated based on the uplink or

downlink throughput need. The uplink or downlink throughput need activates all

SCells to provide throughput according to the following requirements:

- The downlink need is activated if enough data remains in the buffer after a successful PSCell scheduling.
- The uplink need is activated based on the uplink buffer estimate and the UE power headroom.

The number of scheduled SCells determines UE power for each SCell

and the resulting SINR. Therefore, uplink link adaptation needs to consider the

number of scheduled SCells. For more information about

secondary cell activation, see Dynamic Component Carrier Management.

All active SCells are deactivated if the UE reports UAI overheating.

SCell reactivation is not allowed until the overheating condition is mitigated. If

the UAI overheating is mitigated, SCells can be reactivated if the PSCell capacity

is not sufficient to serve the needed downlink or uplink data.

Link Scheduling

Downlink scheduling is performed on all activated PSCell and SCells if the following

requirements are met:

- The reported CQI of these cells is larger than 0.
- There is downlink data in the buffer to transmit.

Uplink scheduling is always performed on the PSCell. If the radio quality and the UE

power headroom for the PSCell are sufficient, uplink scheduling is also performed on

the SCell.

When multiple PSCells are used, not all configured SCells are scheduled for a UE in a

given Transmission Time Interval (TTI) if the following characteristics apply:

- One UE from each PSCell is scheduled in a TTI.
- SCells are shared between UEs.

New data and retransmissions can be sent in parallel, within the same slot, on

different carriers.

If the Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature is not activated, the SCells

remain activated until the SCG radio resources are released.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature increases the uplink throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The uplink throughput is increased by aggregating

up

to four carriers.

The UE might skip the SCells and carriers scheduled by the gNodeB for uplink carrier

aggregation, for example because of capacity limitations. The gNodeB scheduler

detects this when checking the related power headroom reports and adapts the

following processes to the reduced UE capabilities:

- Uplink carrier aggregation scheduling
- Uplink CLPC

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band

## 9.1 Configure Transmission Direction and SCell Relation in High-Band

The NRCellRelation and the NRSectorCarrier MO

instances have configurable attributes in high-band that define the following cell

properties:

- SCell relation
- Direction of the transmission

The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is used to define a

cell to be referenced as an SCell.

The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator is used to define the

coverage area relation of all cells in one sector.

The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute must be set to

ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for all cells

that are SCell candidates. The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator

attribute must be set to OVERLAP for each cell in the same

sector.

The NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute is used to define the

direction of the

transmission.

Among the cells configured for uplink and downlink traffic, the cell with the lowest

ARFCN is selected as PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is enabled, also the

cell configured for uplink and downlink traffic with highest ARFCN is selected as

PSCell if they are assigned to different PAAM segments. One SCell

adjacent to the PSCell can be configured for both uplink and downlink traffic which

allows uplink carrier aggregation. The other uplink- and downlink-configured cells

are used for uplink and downlink carrier aggregation. The other SCell or SCells

within the same sector must be configured to have downlink capability only.

Prerequisites

- The NRCellRelation MO Class exists and have a reference to other instances of the NRCellCU MO in the same sector.
- The SectorEquipmentFunction MO Class exists.
- The NRSectorCarrier MO Class exists.
- The NRFreqRelation MO Class exists.
- The NRFrequency MO Class exists.
- The SectorEquipmentFunction MO is configured and available to be associated with the NRSectorCarrier MO.
- The following attributes of the NRSectorCarrier MO are configured with valid values: NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL NRSectorCarrier.arfcnUL NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Configure the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute to set the transmission direction of a sector carrier.
    1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute value on the PSCell candidate sector carriers to DL\_AND\_UL. The PSCell candidate with the lowest ARFCN is selected as PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is enabled, the PSCell candidates with the lowest and highest ARFCN are selected as PSCells if they are assigned to different PAAM segments. The other PSCell candidate sector carriers can be used as SCells for uplink and downlink carrier aggregation.
    2. Set the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute value on the remaining SCell candidate sector carriers to DL. These sector carriers can be used as SCells for downlink carrier aggregation.
3. Verify that the NRCellRelation MO is set up according to the following steps:
    1. Set the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute value to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for SCell candidate sector carriers in a sector. This configuration allows cells in a sector to be SCell candidates.
    2. Set the NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute value to OVERLAP to define cell relations in a given coverage area.
4. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

Results

The cell relation for SCells and the transmission direction for a sector carrier is

configured.

The SCell configured for uplink and downlink traffic allows uplink carrier

aggregation. Other cells with downlink capability only can be selected as the SCells

for downlink carrier aggregation.

Setting new values in the following attribute combinations can interrupt traffic on

all cells using the AIR unit:

- NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL and NRSectorCarrier.arfcnUL
- NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDLand NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL
