# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 General

This document introduces a detailed design with key configuration parameters for typical NR NSA indoor solution deployment. The target is to support MAs and CUs during the delivery process.

Contents of this document are built on top of the NR Indoor and Venue Solution Guideline which describes the high-level design of Indoor and Venue Solution.

The document assets can be used in the integration phase and rollout preparation, which can support Network Rollout Organization (NRO) to analyze and design delivery plan and manage local delivery portfolio.

## 1.2 Scope

This document describes the main considerations and configuration examples when introducing Radio Dot System (RDS) in NR Indoor and Venue deployment scenarios, including hardware, software, resources (for example, IP/VLAN Plan, RDS key parameters and Baseband capacity).

The following items are within the scope of this document:

- Multi-Operator with RDS configuration examples in NR NSA Option 3x and NR SA Option 2
- General configuration rules and principles on RDS and RAN site connectivity

## 1.3 Assumptions

The prerequisites of NR indoor deployment in the E2E network are:

- The following nodes are deployed:
    - Indoor Radio Unit (IRU) and Radio Dot
    - Baseband
    - Cell Site Router (CSR)
    - 5G Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network nodes, or 5GC
    - Security Gateway if there is an untrusted transport network
- Minimum software level on 5G EPC or 5GC nodes is fulfilled by hardware and software upgrade, see NR NSA Connectivity Guideline with Option 3x or NR SA Connectivity Guideline with Option 2 for details.
- Related NR configurations and the licenses to support Multi-Operator deployment scenarios have been configured and activated on relevant nodes.

# 2 Network Elements

In the Indoor and Venue deployment scenarios, Radio Dot System (RDS) is used to provide indoor coverage. RDS consists of a series of products, such as Radio Dots, Indoor Radio Units (IRUs), Indoor Connect and Radio Dot System accessories.

As the requirement from E2E network solution, the RDS works together with Baseband unit, Cell Site Router (CSR), Security Gateway, ENM, and 5G EPC.

For the detailed information about all these network elements, refer to the NR Indoor and Venue Solution Guideline.

# 3 Indoor and Venue Solution Deployment Scenarios

This chapter introduces Indoor and Venue solution deployment scenarios, which are based on several network factors, including:

- The Indoor and Venue network can be one of the following categories:
    - LTE and NR NSA Option 3x network
    - NR SA Option 2 only network
    - LTE and NR SA Option 2 network
    - LTE, NR SA Option 2 and NR NSA Option 3x network
- The transport network can be:
    - Trusted transport network
    - Untrusted transport network
- The RAN and transport network can be:
    - Dedicated for one operator
    - Shared for multiple operators
- The RAN sharing network can be deployed with MORAN or MOCN configuration, such as:
    - LTE MORAN and NR MORAN
    - LTE MORAN and NR MOCN
    - LTE MOCN and NR MORAN
    - LTE MOCN and NR MOCN

For the connectivity summary of different RAN sharing scenarios, refer to NR Indoor and Venue Solution Guideline.

# 4 Node Deployment and Configuration Guideline

This chapter provides the general principle and guideline regarding the different node deployments and configurations.

## 4.1 Baseband

When deploying and configuring Baseband units for Multi-Operator scenarios, there are some considerations:

- Trusted transport network and untrusted transport network. When the gNodeB or eNodeB is deployed in untrusted transport network, IPsec VPN connection is recommended to be used to protect the traffic.
- Virtual Routers' configuration in Baseband can affect the IP, VLAN, and routing settings.
- Mixed Mode Baseband by running gNodeB and eNodeB on the same Baseband can support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for S1/X2 and OAM traffic.

The following sections describe the configuration guidelines for Baseband in NR NSA connectivity, including Virtual Router, IP address, VLAN etc.

### 4.1.1 Trusted Transport Network

Precondition

Assuming N (N ≤ 6, limited by maximum number of PLMNs supported per Baseband for NR NSA EN-DC) operators are deploying NR NSA within a shared RAN network. For details about the maximum number of supported PLMNs, refer to the NR Indoor and Venue Solution Guideline.

Single Mode Baseband for NR NSA connectivity

In the shared RAN with NR NSA deployment, Single Mode Baseband is run as either gNodeB or eNodeB, and it can be either dedicated or shared among operators. Virtual Router (VR) and IP/VLAN are logically separated in both MOCN and MORAN configurations. The general recommendations are shown in the table below.

| Baseband Node    | VR Number   | VR Description   | IP address Number   | IP address Description                                  | VLAN Number   | VLAN Description   |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Shared gNodeB    | 1           | OAM              | 1                   | IP interface for gNodeB OAM traffic                     | 1             | OAM VLAN           |
| Shared gNodeB    | N           | RAN VR           | N                   | IP interface for Operator’s gNodeB RAN Backhaul traffic | N             | NR VLAN            |
| Shared eNodeB    | 1           | OAM              | 1                   | IP interface for eNodeB OAM traffic                     | 1             | OAM VLAN           |
| Shared eNodeB    | N           | RAN VR           | N                   | IP interface for Operator’s eNodeB RAN Backhaul traffic | N             | LTE VLAN           |
| Dedicated gNodeB | 1           | OAM              | 1                   | IP interface for gNodeB OAM traffic                     | 1             | OAM VLAN           |
| Dedicated gNodeB | 1           | RAN VR           | 1                   | IP interface for Operator’s gNodeB RAN Backhaul traffic | 1             | NR VLAN            |
| Dedicated eNodeB | 1           | OAM              | 1                   | IP interface for eNodeB OAM traffic                     | 1             | OAM VLAN           |
| Dedicated eNodeB | 1           | RAN VR           | 1                   | IP interface for Operator’s eNodeB RAN Backhaul traffic | 1             | LTE VLAN           |

Note: N equals to the number of operators in shared RAN scenarios.

The RAN Backhaul traffic is the S1-C/U and X2-C/U for eNodeB, or the S1-U and X2-C/U for gNodeB. In the typical RAN network deployment, RAN traffic separation is not considered for an operator, to reduce the required number of IP addresses per Baseband and simplify the routing configurations in the transport network. If the Baseband node is shared by multiple operators, and the operators require EN-DC X2 control plane and user plane traffic separation, then the RAN traffic separation can be supported as described below:

- EN-DC control plane:
    - There is only one SCTP association between two shared nodes (shared eNodeB and shared gNodeB).
    - It is possible to configure separate X2-C SCTP endpoints for each operator (shared eNodeB and dedicated gNodeB).
- EN-DC user plane:
    - It supports separate EN-DC X2-U references for each PLMN between two shared nodes. On the shared eNodeB, the selection criterion of local X2-U IP is per UE context and selected PLMN by UE. On the shared gNodeB, the selection criterion of local X2-U IP is based on the IE selected PLMN in SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message during EN-DC setup (shared eNodeB and shared gNodeB).

Mixed Mode Baseband for NR NSA Connectivity

Considering the hardware cost-effectiveness, a Mixed Mode Baseband for NR and LTE can be selected to deploy shared NR NSA RAN.

As a Baseband unit can support up to 60 Virtual Routers and six PLMNs for EN-DC，the VR and IP/VLAN are separated logically. The following configuration options are recommended as shown in the table below when the number of operators is equal to or less than six.

| VR Number   | VR Description   | IP address Number   | IP address Description                                                       | VLAN Number   | VLAN Description   |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1           | OAM VR           | 1                   | IP interface for OAM traffic                                                 | 1             | OAM VLAN           |
| M           | NR VR            | M                   | IP interface for Operator’s gNodeB RAN (S1-U, X2-C/U) traffic                | M             | NR VLAN            |
| M           | LTE VR           | M                   | IP interface for Operator’s eNodeB RAN (S1-C/U, X2-C/U, ENDC X2-C/U) traffic | M             | LTE VLAN           |

Note: M (M ≤ 6) is equal to the number of operators.

For the internal EN-DC X2 traffic between the LTE and NR in the Mixed Mode Baseband, it can be forwarded between two separated RAN VRs by using the inter-VR static routing configured in both VRs.

### 4.1.2 Untrusted Transport Network

For Multi-Operator deployment scenarios in the untrusted transport network, refer to the Shared NR RAN Solution Guideline for network connectivity planning and configuration guidelines.

## 4.2 Radio Dot System

### 4.2.1 Radio Dot

Operators have their own authorized frequency bands and network deployment plans. To deploy mobile broadband coverage for Indoor and Venue deployment cases, the following aspects must be considered when selecting products from the Radio Dot System (RDS) portfolio:

- RAT Type
- Frequency Band
- Cell Bandwidth
- Instantaneous Bandwidth (IBW)
- Spectrum Allocation
- Maximum Output Power

See Radio Dot Description in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library for more information on the following:

- The supported RAT
- The supported Band
- The supported Cell Bandwidth
- The supported IBW
- The supported Maximum Output Power
- Other Radio Dot capabilities

The RDS portfolio also provides the Radio Dot with external antennas. For example, Dot 4485 is a Tri-Band Radio Dot with the same capabilities as Dot 4475. Dot 4485 is a Radio Dot with external antennas that must be used in specific use cases only, such as elevator shafts and long hallways. In these cases, the Radio Dot with external antennas can provide a directional antenna instead of the integrated omni-antenna to reduce interference and increase coverage. For more information on the location of the Radio Dot with external antennas, see the chapter External Antenna Connectors in System and Node Overview in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library.

### 4.2.2 IRU

After the Radio Dots are selected, the appropriate Indoor Radio Unit (IRU) product must be selected. When selecting IRU products, the following aspects must be considered:

- The compatibility between the IRU and the Radio Dot. See Supported Radio Capabilities for more information.
- The number of supported Radio Dot Ports. Depending on IRU variants, it can be connected to up to 8 or 16 concurrent Radio Dots.
- The Radio Dot Interface (RDI) type and RDI cable reach. Only IRU 8850 and IRU 1649 support hybrid fiber-copper cable with a reach ranging from 300 meters to 1100 meters, depending on the Radio Dot variants, and optical fiber extensions up to 10 kilometers. Other IRU variants support the CAT 6A cable, with a reach of up to 160 meters, depending on Radio Dot variants.
- The number of supported Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) ports. The IRU 8850 and IRU 164x series each support four CPRI ports, with maximum CPRI rates of up to 24.3 Gbps and 10.1 Gbps, respectively. Other IRU 88xx series support two CPRI ports.
- A single 10.1G CPRI link between Baseband and IRU could support up to one 4T4R 100-MHz NR cell. If additional cell bandwidth is required on the same IRU, an extra CPRI link must be provisioned accordingly. A 24.3G CPRI link can support two 4T4R 100-MHz NR cell with spare capacity remaining.

For the detailed description of IRU capabilities, see Indoor Radio Unit Description in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library.

### 4.2.3 RDS Key Parameters

The table below shows the key parameters for the Radio Dot System (RDS), including MOs and MO attributes that must be configured on Baseband units.

| MO/MO Attributes                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## 4.3 Cell Site Router

The Baseband can be directly connected to different types of transport networks, such as:

- Baseband connected to the Layer 2 Ethernet VPN Network, such as E-LINE or E-LAN.
- Baseband connected to the Layer 3 IP VPN Network.

In this chapter, the Baseband is connected directly to the Cell Site Router (CSR) with the Layer 3 IP VPN transport networks with the following considerations:

- Normally, one CSR router is deployed in the Indoor and Venue RAN site, and dual CSR routers can be used as an option to achieve redundancy.

The figure below shows the connectivity for one CSR.

![Image](../images/369_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.U/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 1   Single CSR Router Connection to RAN Site

The figure below shows the connectivity for dual CSRs.

![Image](../images/369_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.U/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 2   Dual CSR Routers Connection to RAN Site

- Both OAM and RAN traffic flows exist in the transport network, and the OAM and RAN traffic are separated indifferent Virtual Routers (VRs).
- The LTE RAN traffic and NR RAN traffic can share a VR or be separated in dedicated VRs.
- In the shared RAN network, dedicated RAN VR for each operator and one shared OAM VR for operators is recommended.

The figure below shows the VR definitions in the CSR router, one shared OAM VR for Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) purposes, and dedicated RAN VR for each operator.

![Image](../images/369_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.U/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 3   VR Definitions in CSR Router

## 4.4 ENM

For Multi-Operator or Neutral Host with shared RAN deployments, only one of the stakeholders could have the fully OAM control of all shared Baseband nodes. An agreement is necessary among the stakeholders regarding the management of shared Baseband nodes.

## 4.5 Security

To enable RAN sharing with an untrusted transport network, where different operators use their own core network nodes and Security Gateways to share a single Baseband, the following prerequisites need to be fulfilled:

- Inner and outer networks are separated in different Virtual Routers (in Baseband) and Routing instances (in Security Gateway).
- IPsec VPN is required for RAN traffic protection. The OAM traffic can also be protected in a separated IPsec VPN between Baseband and Security Gateway. An alternative solution of OAM traffic protection is to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) with Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) solution between Baseband and ENM.
- Relevant certificates must be enrolled to Baseband units and Security Gateways that have been involved.

This is necessary as the shared Baseband unit is connected to two or more involved Security Gateways simultaneously and Security Gateways must trust the shared or dedicated Baseband unit. Certificate Management Protocol version 2 (CMPv2) protocol is used for certificate enrollment for IPsec which enables zero touch certificate enrollment, including negotiation and key exchange as part of the IKE process with CA server.

Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) is required for the IPsec certificate management.

For details, refer to the Manage Security.

## 4.6 Synchronization

To meet the TDD mid-band NR NSA EN-DC requirements, both gNodeB and eNodeB must achieve the time and phase synchronization through GNSS or Precision Time Protocol (PTP). Time and phase synchronization of the radio interface is also essential to operate and transmit data for the NR SA system.

In many indoor and venue deployments, Mixed Mode Radios and Multi-Operator RAN with dedicated Baseband units are common. For Baseband units sharing radio resources through CPRI, Node Group Synchronization (NGS) must be used to make the nodes tightly synchronized to each other.

For more information about synchronization considerations for Indoor and Venue deployment scenarios, refer to the NR Indoor and Venue Solution Guideline.

## 4.7 Core Network

In network sharing deployment scenarios, the shared RAN nodes can be connected to:

- Different core networks of single operator to achieve redundancy for each operator.
- Different core networks of different operators as MORAN or MOCN solution.

From a node configuration perspective, the principles for single operator are valid for multiple operators as well.

## 4.8 QoS

In the Indoor and Venue solution, the E2E QoS implementation is required to guarantee the Quality of Experience for end users.

For the QoS design and configuration, see E2E QoS Guideline.

# 5 Solution Configuration Examples

In this chapter, the following shared RAN Configuration examples are covered. In each example, the key configurations for each network element node are described.

|          5 | ESS Deployment with LTE MORAN and NR MORAN, Mixed Mode Baseband for each Operator, Trusted Transport |

Note: A software package set is mandatory to enable NR NSA with Option 3x and NR SA Option 2 in Radio Dot System (RDS). Some packages contain one or more features that enable the required functions. For these software packages and feature licenses, refer to Radio Dot System NR.

## 5.1 LTE MORAN and NR MORAN, with Shared gNodeB and Shared
    eNodeB,Trusted Transport

In this scenario, both gNodeB and eNodeB nodes are shared between both operators, and the operators use dedicated spectrums for both LTE anchor cells and NR cells. This is referred as LTE MORAN and NR MORAN case with trusted transport network.

### 5.1.1 E2E Network Connectivity

The figure below shows a physical connectivity for LTE MORAN and NR MORAN network for indoor coverage. The Operator A is the primary operator, which owns the RAN site nodes, such as CSR, Baseband units, IRU, and Radio Dots. The Operator B is the secondary operator which shares the RAN site nodes with Operator A.

A shared gNodeB and a shared eNodeB are connected to the core networks of both Operator A and Operator B through a CSR. An IRU 1648 is connected to both gNodeB and eNodeB through CPRI links. There are eight Dot 4475 units connected to IRU 1648 through CAT 6A cable, which is used for indoor coverage.

### 5.1.4 LTE MORAN and NR MORAN Configuration

In this LTE MORAN and NR MORAN example case, the Baseband units are shared by two operators.

There are four cells defined in this example:

- NR Cell 1: the NR cell with PLMN A and frequency M1, which is dedicated for Operator A.
- NR Cell 2: the NR cell with PLMN B and frequency M2, which is dedicated for Operator B.
- LTE Cell 1: the LTE cell with PLMN A and frequency L1, which is dedicated for Operator A.
- LTE Cell 2: the LTE cell with PLMN B and frequency L2, which is dedicated for Operator B.

The eNodeB is configured with MOCN as MORAN mode, both PLMN A and PLMN B are configured in each LTE cell.

## 5.2 LTE MORAN and NR MOCN, with Shared gNodeB and Dedicated
    eNodeB, Trusted Transport

In this scenario, gNodeB is shared between two operators, and eNodeBs are dedicated for each operator. The two operators use dedicated spectrums for LTE and shared spectrum for NR. This is referred as LTE MORAN and NR MOCN case with shared gNodeB and dedicated eNodeB.

### 5.2.1 E2E Network Connectivity

In the below example, the Operator A is the primary operator, which owns most of the RAN site nodes, such as CSR, Baseband units, IRUs, Radio Dots and ENM. The Operator B is the secondary operator, which owns dedicated eNodeB, ENM for eNodeB, and shares other RAN components with Operator A.

The shared gNodeB is connected to the core networks of both Operator A and Operator B, while the dedicated eNodeBs are connected to their core networks respectively. This case is based on a trusted transport network. One IRU 1648 is connected to gNodeB and one IRU 8844 is connected to two eNodeBs. Eight Dot 4479 units are connected to IRU 1648 provide indoor NR coverage. Meanwhile, eight Dot 2272 units are connected to IRU 8844 offer indoor LTE coverage and serve as EN-DC LTE anchor cells.

The figure below shows the physical connectivity for LTE MORAN and NR MOCN network for indoor coverage.
