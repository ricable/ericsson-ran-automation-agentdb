Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following network requirements must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The radio units shared between the Baseband units must be compatible with Mixed Mode Radio, see Radio Node Configurations.
- For CPRI-based radios, Node Group Synchronization must be configured for Baseband units. See Manage Node Group Synchronization.
- The required licenses for Split Mode Radio or Mixed Mode Radio must be available.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Multi-Operator RAN

Each spectrum is managed individually by a gNodeB, one per operator.

With Multi-Operator RAN, two nodes that belong to different operators can share radio

units in a split mode or mixed mode configuration. Each node represents a different

gNodeB in the NR RAN. If the nodes are installed in the same cabinet, they share the

support system.

When sharing radio units, operators need to work together to operate the nodes. Two

Baseband units can share NMS and OSS also in a Multi-Operator RAN configuration.

## 3.1 Network Management

The installed Baseband units are managed separately from the respective network

management systems. From the OSS, the different Baseband units in the RBS appear as

separate individual nodes. More information about Multi-Operator RAN in the OSS is found

in the OSS CPI.

Although the Baseband units are seen as separate nodes and configured separately, some

coordination is necessary for configuration and maintenance. For example, the antenna

configuration is only controlled by the data from the OSS of one of the nodes. Some

alarms related to the antenna system or the support system are only reported from one of

the nodes. Operators must coordinate their operation.

The operators can use different OSS systems for the two nodes in Multi-Operator RAN. The

benefits of using the same OSS are additional coordination functions, such as monitoring

all alarms for the nodes in the same cabinet.

## 3.2 Radio Configurations

Each node in a Multi-Operator RAN configuration has a separate radio configuration,

although the radios are shared. Sectors in Multi-Operator RAN are configured with a

Radio Building Block (RBB) that supports a shared radio.

FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe for each radio must be

configured as shared by setting the attribute to TRUE.

Figure 1   Radio Configurations

### 3.2.1 Configurations with Three Shared AIR 6488 Units

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show examples of Multi-Operator RAN

configurations where both nodes have three sectors in three shared AIR 6488 radios.

Figure 2   Two Baseband Units and Three AIR 6488 with Multi-Operator RAN in Mixed Mode Radio

Configuration

Figure 3   Two Baseband Units and Three AIR 6488 with Multi-Operator RAN in Split Mode Radio

Configuration

The supported radio configurations and carrier allocations are defined in Radio Node Configurations.

The output power will be limited either by the Power HWAC per node or by the maximum

supported output power per radio.

## 3.3 Frequency Bands

All carriers for connected nodes must be configured within the bandwidth span supported

by the radio units.

For information on supported frequency bands, see Radio Node Configurations.

## 3.4 Output Power

The maximum output power is allocated statically for each Baseband unit in the respective

node configuration.

When an additional carrier is configured, the radio unit might need to retune the

transmitter. An interruption of approximately 1.5 seconds occurs on any already

configured carrier.

The maximum configurable output power level per radio unit and per Baseband unit is

limited by the maximum output power of the radio and the power configuration set by the

other Baseband unit. A radio unit rejects power configuration requests if the total

requested power level (for Baseband units) exceeds the internal radio hardware

limitation.

In addition, HWACs are required to configure more than 20 W per node. For example, if a

radio unit is shared and configured for 30 W by the primary node and 30 W by the

secondary node, both nodes require sufficient HWAC capacity to use that radio unit.

Power configuration is done separately for each RAT. The power is set in mW for  the

NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute .

For certain configurations, the average output power will be decreased due to back-off

values applied in the radio units. For further information, see Radio Node Configurations.

## 3.5 Support System and Control

With the Multi-Operator RAN feature, one node must act as a primary node, and all

others as secondary nodes.

When two or more nodes are installed in the same cabinet, one of them acts as the primary

node in the support system and controls the climate and power functions in the cabinet. It

does not matter which node is acting primary node toward the support system in the cabinet,

however, all other nodes must be configured as secondary nodes.

For more information about primary and secondary nodes in the support system, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

## 3.6 Cabling and Connections

Information on cabling between the Baseband unit and the radio, and Non-RF connections

in RBS cabinets can be relevant to the Multi-Operator RAN feature.

For information on cabling and connections, see the following documents:

- Radio Connections
- Non-RF Connections

## 3.7 Node Group Synchronization

The NGS architecture must be used in features that share radio resources.

For information on NGS, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.

## 3.8 Antenna System

A general overview of the antenna system can be found in Manage Hardware Equipment.

### 3.8.1 Control and Supervision

The nodes sharing a common antenna system must be configured so maximum antenna control

and supervision is achieved.

The antenna system resources, such as Tower

Mounted Amplifier (TMA), are shared by the nodes. The management and supervision of the

antenna system resources is performed by the primary

node.

VSWR supervision on the internal radio TX feeder is possible. VSWR supervision is

performed by the radio unit, and is independent of the supervision of antenna system

resources, such as TMAs.

The antenna configuration data, such as attenuation and delay, must be configured in both

nodes.

### 3.8.2 Antenna Alarms

With no TMA supervision, the co-siting node needs to be checked for TMA alarms.

If one of the nodes is configured to supervise AISG compatible devices, TMA

alarms are provided by that node.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Multi-Operator RAN

Capacity and Performance

The maximum output power per Baseband unit is limited since the radio unit power is

shared between the two carriers. This causes limitations between the two carriers in

the nodes. See Output Power for more configuration

information.

The total downtime for cells using Multi-Operator RAN might increase since there are

two nodes that can cause radio unit restarts. The restart time for a radio unit in a

Multi-Operator RAN configuration is also increased. See Locks and Restarts for more information.

# 6 Performance of NR Multi-Operator RAN

KPIs

There are no Key Performance Indicators (KPI) specifically for NR Multi-Operator

RAN.

Certain factors, such as inter-modulation (IM) and changes in antenna tilt, can

affect existing KPIs. The effects can be cell-specific. If one of the nodes goes

down, KPIs in the other node can be affected.

For standard specific KPI information, see Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Multi-Operator RAN

## 8.1 Expansion to Multi-Operator RAN

Expansion to multi-operator RAN is performed by installing and configuring the nodes in

sequential order.

To expand to Multi-Operator RAN, the same instructions apply as for expanding to mixed mode

radio or split mode radio. For more information on the process, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

## 8.2 Configuration

No check is done to find out whether the configurations in the two nodes are compatible.

Configuration planning, therefore, requires detailed knowledge of the special

considerations that must be taken when sharing a radio unit between nodes. These

considerations are summarized in the configuration guidelines below.

The following guidelines apply when configuring nodes in Multi-Operator RAN:

- In each case where LTE and NR carriers are located within the same frequency band, the following conditions must be met: The NR TDD pattern must be synchronized with the LTE TDD pattern for all coexisting base stations. Synchronized TDD patterns also include the same N\_TA offset configuration. In case of TDD frequency bands, the same N\_TA offset must be configured for all carriers and branches in one radio. TDD frequency bands must be configured to the same N\_TA offset as that of any other carrier transmitted by any other base station. The transmitted carriers must be located in the following way: In the same frequency band In the same geographical area
- For shared TDD radios, the same downlink and uplink configurations must be set in every cell with the help of the following attributes: NRCellDU.tddUlDlPattern NRCellDU.tddSpecialSlotPattern NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence The NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute must be set to true when NR and LTE carriers are in the same frequency band. It must be set to false when only NR carriers are located in the frequency band.
- In FDD, the same N\_TA offset must be configured for the NR and LTE components of an ESS carrier. In addition, frequency bands require the configuration of the same N\_TA offset as that of any other carrier transmitted by any other base station. The transmitted carriers must be located in the following way: In the same frequency band In the same geographical area
- For shared FDD radios, the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute must be set to the same value in every cell. It must be set to true when NR and LTE carriers are in the same frequency band and overlap in frequency. It can be set to false if NR and LTE carriers are separated without overlapping in frequency. When only NR cells are in the same frequency band, this attribute must be set to false.
- The sum of the power allocated to the two nodes must not exceed the radio unit limitation. If the radio unit during configuration reaches the maximum power level, the radio unit will reject the configuration request. An alarm is raised and the cell setup fails.
- If during configuration the radio unit reaches the maximum amount of carriers, the configuration request is rejected. An alarm is raised and the cell setup fails.

## 8.3 Multi-Operator RAN Visibility

Information about Multi-Operator RAN visibility from the OSS can be found in the OSS

CPI.

The Element Manager shows whether a radio unit is configured to be shared with more than one

managed element by using the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe

attribute.

## 8.4 Locks and Restarts

Locking and restarting a Baseband unit or a radio unit can affect the other Baseband

unit:

When a radio unit is locked or set in full maintenance mode, this is propagated to all

related nodes. This must be considered before planning or initiating any maintenance

activity.

Restarting radio units causes downtime in corresponding sectors in both nodes.

Locking and restarting Baseband units affect the system as follows:

- Locking or setting a Baseband unit to full maintenance mode causes all synchronization references to be dependency locked and effectively lost. As a consequence, the Baseband unit enters holdover mode. For more information, refer to Manage Node Group Synchronization.
- Cold restarts repeated within a very short time affect the clock stability, so the Baseband unit might not be able to maintain holdover mode or its clock drifts from the other Baseband unit. This can cause traffic disturbances in the other LTE node.

## 8.5 Alarms

When an error occurs in a shared radio, alarms are generated in all related nodes. Before

taking action to solve the issue, the other node in the Multi-Operator RAN configuration

must be identified. Two alarms generated by the same failure can be named differently in

different nodes.
