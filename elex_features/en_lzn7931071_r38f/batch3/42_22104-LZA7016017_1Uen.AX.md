Summary

Coverage Extension Low-Band enables PRACH preamble format 0 configuration in Low-Band (FDD)

only. The feature increases cell range support and enables a larger coverage area

for the gNodeB in Low-Band. Supported coverage increases to

15 km from 10 km (configured with PRACH preamble format B4).

Table 1   Low-Band Cell Range Support

| PRACH Preamble Format   | Maximum Cell Range Support   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| B4                      | 10 km                        |

For details on PRACH preamble format 0 in Mid-Band, see PRACH Enhancements Mid-Band.

PRACH preamble format 0 uses multiple PRACH configuration indexes in the gNodeB. Configuration indexes are sent in the RRC configuration

message.

PRACH configuration indexes used for preamble format 0 are the following:

- 16 Begins in symbol number 0 Constitutes a 10 ms period Preamble begins from subframe or slot number 1
- 17 Begins in symbol number 0 Constitutes a 10 ms period Preamble begins from subframe or slot number 4
- 18 Begins in symbol number 0 Constitutes a 10 ms period Preamble begins from subframe or slot number 7

Operational Process

The feature requires that the following parameters are set:

- NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat
- NRCellDU.cellRange
- NRCellDU.rachRootSequence

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage Extension Low-Band

PRACH preamble format 0 enables cell range extension up to 15 km.

Capacity and Performance

PRACH preamble format 0 supports increased area coverage with a small number of

sites. Performance gain is detectable with preamble format 0 as compared to preamble

format B4.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Events

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Coverage Extension Low-Band

The feature enables the configuration of cell range settings to define the number of

RACH root sequences in each cell.

## 8.1 Cell Range Settings

### 8.1.1 Cell Range Configuration in Low-Band

The NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attribute configures the value of the

first

prach-RootSequenceIndex

for RACH in the cell. PRACH resources overlap in the network. It is recommended to set

the NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attribute to different values in

neighboring cells to reduce the probability of false RACH detections. Different

preambles can be defined for different cells with the

NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat attribute.

The number of required RACH root sequences in each cell

depends on the cell range and the total number of RACH preambles set for the cell. The

NRCellDU.cellRange attribute is used to set the cell range unless

it is done automatically. The NRCellDU.totalNoOfRaPreambles attribute

is used to set the total number of RACH preambles for the cell unless it is done

automatically.

NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1Ooc Counter Range

Calculation

The NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1Ooc counter measures the number of

CBRA preambles that are discarded because the timing offset of the preambles

corresponds to a distance that is greater than the configured cell range. This

observable distance is limited and depends on

zeroCorrelationZoneConfig, which controls the NCS

cyclic shift value used for the random access preamble generation. For more

information, see Section 6.3.3 in 3GPP TS 38.211 version 16.6.0.

The appropriate value of zeroCorrelationZoneConfig is selected

automatically for the configured cell range. Each value of

zeroCorrelationZoneConfig has a corresponding maximum cell

range, and this is the maximum observable distance of the counter for the given

configuration. The maximum observable distance of the counters is the closest bigger

maximum cell range value to the configured cell range. The timing offset TA of the

preamble can only be correctly calculated if the UE is in the observable

distance.

Unrestricted Set of Cyclic Preamble Shifts

The NR system applies the unrestricted set of cyclic shifts for preambles.

The number of required RACH root sequences for a cell can be calculated using the

following equation:

Where Preambles for each RACH Root Sequences is the number of preambles that can be

created by one RACH root sequence for a given cell range and RACH format. For the

applicable values, see Table 4.

Table 4   Example Configuration for Cell Range and Number of RACH Root Sequences for

Low-Band, Unrestricted Set

| Preamble Format  (1)   |   Value of zeroCorrelationZoneConfig |   NCS Value | Cell Range (m)   |   Preambles for Each RACH Root Sequences |

(1)

The number of preambles for each RACH root sequences in each

cell depends on the cell range and the RACH Format B4 is the

default preamble format. For supported Low-Band formats, see

Feature Operation in Coverage Extension Low-Band.

(2)

To avoid high levels of false detection with preamble

format B4, it is not recommended to configure a cell

range that is less than 200

m.

Example 1   Cell Range Configuration with Unrestricted Set and a Total Number of 32 RACH

Preambles

If the value of the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute is set to

1,500 in a cell with preamble format B4, Table 4 shows that six preambles can be

created for each RACH root sequence. The number of required RACH root sequences

equals

. Applying the default value of 1 for the

NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attribute means that sequences 1,

2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are to be used in that cell. The values of the

NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attributes in adjacent cells must

differ by at least 6 (7-12), and 132 (133-137, 0) at most. The reason for this is a

wrap-around between the first and the last value in the value range.

Example 2   Cell Range Configuration with Unrestricted Set and a Total Number of 17 RACH

Preambles

If the value of the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute is set to

4,000 in a cell with format 0, the configured cell range is

between 4,410 m and 3,560 m. This corresponds to 6 as the value of the

zeroCorrelationZoneConfig, with an NCS value of

32. The maximum observable distance is the maximum cell range, 4,410 m. The range of

the NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1Ooc PM counter is the difference

between 4,410 m and 4,000 m, which is 410 m.

Restricted Set of Cyclic Preamble Shifts

The High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature applies the restricted set of cyclic shifts

for preambles. The restricted set is only supported on PRACH preamble format 0 and

PRACH preamble format 1.

With restricted sets, only 16 CBRA preambles can be used, and the number of required

RACH root sequences is shown in Table 5

and Table 6.
