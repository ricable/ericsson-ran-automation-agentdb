# 1 Introduction

Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) uses cellular radio capacity to provide broadband access to residential customers or Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as an alternative to Fixed Broadband (FBB) access technologies (DSL, cable, or fiber). The new spectrum and capacity available with 5G enable even larger and more cost-effective FWA deployments than ever before.

Compared to Mobile Broadband (MBB) access, where data connectivity is realized as a best effort service, FWA can deliver guaranteed services in terms of capacity, availability, and throughput. This has implications for the planning, dimensioning and operation of 3GPP mobile networks.

This document provides an overview of 5G FWA supported by Ericsson products for NR Standalone (SA) Option 2 and NR Non-Standalone (NSA) Option 3x deployments covering the relevant impacts and changes needed to an existing mobile network when FWA is deployed. The Radio, Core Network (CN), and Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) domains are included in the impact analysis.

The technical concepts and example network designs described in this document aim to support technical sales managers during customer engagement and pre-sales activities, as well as solution architects in the planning and deployment of E2E FWA.

## 1.1 General

This document presents different alternatives to deploy FWA using NR SA Option 2, NR NSA Option 3x or both in parallel. The main focus is on the RAN domain applying network slicing, QoS, observability, mobility and interaction with the MBB service. Related functions in the core network are outlined on a conceptual level when they are relevant for the description of certain deployment scenarios or the RAN - core network interworking. In order to estimate how many customers can be supported in a sector, a FWA pre-qualification phase is discussed looking at rejecting the worst located X% households, replacing indoor CPE with outdoor CPE for the worst located X% households, or a combination of rejection and selective outdoor CPE.

Figure 1   3GPP Network Architecture Options Applied to FWA

The fundamental network realization approach is to reuse 4G-5G network assets as far as possible, including sharing spectrum with MBB.

Typical FWA deployment target areas range from dense suburbs to more rural residential areas, with less focus on urban areas, where Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) penetration might be high, and deep rural areas, where major site densification would be required to achieve targeted services levels. Depending on the acquired and deployed spectrum, FWA deployments in High-Band, Mid-Band and Low-Band are possible. For more information see:

## 1.2 Scope

This document covers the following main topics:

- FWA architecture for NR SA Option 2 and NR SA Option 3x based on 3GPP release 15 and onwards applicable to FWA deployments.
- Overview of supported FWA relevant features in RAN, including e.g., slice-aware QoS, resource management, and core network function selection.
- The description of a pre-qualification phase to decide how many customers can be supported in a sector.

The following topics are out of scope for the current document version:

- CPE Management.
- Detailed core network aspects.
- Transport network considerations.

# 2 Principles and Guidelines

The following three business segments are envisaged for FWA service deployments:

- Connect the Unconnected This business segment provides basic connectivity services targeting countries or geographical areas (for example, rural villages) with sold data rates on downlink in the range of for example 10-100 Mbps.
- Build with Precision This business segment provides various wireless connectivity services tailored to the needs of different consumer groups. The connectivity services are typically offered with sold data rates on downlink in the range of for example 50-200 Mbps.
- Wireless Fiber This business segment provides high-quality broadband connectivity services with sold data rates on downlink in the range of for example 100-1000+ Mbps addressing the most bandwidth-demanding customer segments.

The FWA service offerings are similar to those in FBB access networks and mainly composed of data rate and optional volume-based broadband connectivity services. These services can be bundled with complementary Value-Added Services (VAS), like Voice or IPTV. For details, see section  Value-Added Services.

Depending on the deployment cases different NR architectures (NR NSA, NR SA) and different frequency ranges might be used.

This Principles and Guidelines section provides an FWA architecture overview, FWA planning &amp; deployment considerations and elaborates on the main FWA relevant RAN features:

- Network Slicing and QoS
- Radio Resource Partitioning
- UE Grouping
- Carrier Aggregation
- NR-DC
- EN-DC
- VoNR
- Massive MIMO
- Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band

See  RAN Features for detailed feature description references.

## 2.1 Architecture Overview

The figure below provides a high-level overview of the potential deployment area for FWA. New spectrum with large bandwidths is becoming available in increasing quantities. This includes for example Mid-Band TDD spectrum with typically 50-150 MHz per operator, and High-Bands in the mmWave range, with typically 400-800 MHz per operator. Such broad bands can carry large amounts of traffic benefiting both FWA and MBB. Considering both NR architectures, NR NSA and SA, several deployment options are possible supporting the operator needs for FWA deployments. A typical FWA deployment start could be to use for example 20 MHz from a TDD Mid-Band spectrum to connect FWA households.

Figure 2   Geographical FWA Deployment Area Overview Based on MBB Focused MNO Build Out

Note: Dedicated High- or Mid-Band spectrum could be used for FWA in sub-urban or rural areas as well.

The scenarios below exemplify common FWA deployment cases. Both NR SA and NR NSA deployments are considered. In these example cases MBB and FWA users have access to the same carriers. In area 0 High-Band or Mid-Band are available. Both can be used as main capacity layer for FWA deployments depending on operators' choice. Area 1 exemplifies a case in which a high-power FWA CPE is used together with the Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature. In area 2 only Mid-Band is available as capacity band. In area 3 an example is shown in which high-power FWA CPEs can get access to the capacity band depending on the UE power class. In area 0 and area 1 with good High-Band coverage, there is also such option to introduce NR SA HB minimum viable product (MVP) for FWA deployment with performance optimization, which can provide high peak data rate with SLA fulfillment on high power FWA CPE devices at good and medium radio conditions and line of sight (LOS).

Figure 3   FWA Deployment Use Case Examples

It is up to concrete operator deployment cases if the above shown areas are part of an urban, sub-urban or rural deployment.

Below the overall architecture of Fixed Broadband (FBB) and Mobile Broadband (MBB) access networks is shown. These have been augmented with the following FWA specific hardware and software components, shown in green in the figure:

- FWA Customer Premises Equipment (CPE): A 3GPP compliant device consisting of a modem and an antenna for access to a mobile network
- FWA CPE Management: A management system that provides remote access to the FWA CPE for configuration, performance measurement, or troubleshooting purposes. For FBB or fixed-mobile converged operators, this can be an integral part of or extension to an existing Residential Gateway (RGW) management system.

Note: Besides adding these FWA specific components to the network, many of the existing radio, packet core, or management nodes must also be dimensioned, deployed, or configured adequately when providing FWA on top of MBB services.

Figure 4   End-to-End FWA Architecture

Slicing and QoS features can be used in a shared FWA/MBB network to provide performance differentiation between subscriber groups. These can be used to adjust radio resource distribution to achieve performance targets more optimally for each subscriber group. These features can be used both in NR NSA and NR SA deployments. The figure below provides a high-level example of a NR SA Mid-Band setup.

Figure 5   Slicing and QoS Overview

## 2.2 Planning and Deployment

### 2.2.1 CPE Selection and Pre-Qualification

Pre-qualification can be used to significantly boost network performance by disallowing households that do not have an adequate radio link to use network resources efficiently. Dimensioning methodology is based on achieving a minimum rate for the worst 5% of households, so prohibiting cell-edge households from FWA service allows a drastic increase in network capacity. Alternatively, cell-edge users can be provisioned with an outdoor or high power CPE (see section  High-Power UE Support in NR for details) instead, which significantly increases the resource efficiency for these users and has very similar effects to pre-qualification.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 6   FWA Capacity Increase Example

The table above is based on a simulation of a US suburb and shows the capacity increase that results from either pre-qualification, outdoor CPE provisioning, or both. Note that the effect of pre-qualification is very similar to outdoor CPE provisioning, with only a slightly lower capacity obtained from outdoor CPEs instead of outright rejection. This is due to the drastic increase in performance that outdoor CPEs add, especially for cell-edge users, and in particular if the capacity is uplink limited.

An optimized FWA network includes pre-qualification and allows for a mixture of indoor CPEs and outdoor CPEs, normal or high power versions. Outdoor CPE provisioning maximizes the overall addressable customer base, so if customers are scarce and subscriber penetration growth is in focus, then outdoor CPE provisioning should be considered. Alternatively, household rejection will enable the network to handle a similar maximum number of households with only indoor CPE provisioning, and with indoor CPE, the cost per household is lower. Thus, if there are many households requiring the service and there is a limited impact on end-user customer perception caused by rejecting households, then pre-exclusion is preferred.

If the FWA demand increases past the network capacity it is possible to either add radio capacity or migrate users who have indoor CPEs with poor coverage to outdoor CPEs, freeing up network resources for new households. This method of migrating indoor CPE users to outdoor CPEs provides new growth opportunities as the market develops, without having to invest heavily in outdoor CPEs during FWA introduction when the demand is relatively unknown. Additionally, these users will see a significant increase in their FWA performance after changing from indoor CPEs to outdoor CPEs, increasing customer willingness to support this migration.

As the capacity in terms of number of households served depends on the poorest quality radio link, it is important that both downlink and uplink is considered during pre-qualification. By providing outdoor CPEs to the worst located users, the case might shift from being uplink-limited to downlink-limited, which is typically easier to address for a CSP.

#### 2.2.1.1 Pre-Qualification Methods

There are three identified pre-qualification methods:

- Using radio link simulation data, drive test data or other nearby measurement data to estimate the expected radio link at the household. Measured or simulated data can be given a modifier depending on CPE type and building type to account for the gains or losses in radio performance for outdoor and indoor CPEs as well as expected placement options. Households can be rejected if the CPE is not expected to achieve a target RSSI or SINR at the household. This is only an estimation, and actual CPE measurements may be better or worse than expected due to other factors, such as user installation error, sub-optimal placement of indoor CPEs, obstructions, and interference.
- Relying on end-user measurements to provide real measurement data at the household. Mobile apps can be used on end-user UEs to measure radio conditions at possible CPE locations. This also has the benefit of instructing the end-user about the optimal placement of the CPE device, whether it be indoor or outdoor.
- Relying on professional measurement of CPE devices to ensure that the CPEs achieve an adequate radio link. This is the most expensive option but also the most reliable to qualify households for service. This can be done as a final check after performing one of the other pre-qualification methods as well, to avoid additional cost. See section CPE Observability for details.

#### 2.2.1.2 High-Band Pre-Qualification

High-Band frequencies have propagation characteristics that have much shorter range and are far more susceptible to influence from environmental factors, such as foliage, weather, and obstructions. Many indoor CPE placement locations will not be feasible to achieve good High-Band deployments, and outdoor CPEs are recommended to provide sufficient coverage. Even with outdoor CPEs it is unlikely that High-Band coverage will be available for many targeted FWA households, which will have to be provisioned on Mid-Band or Low-Band spectrum or be rejected from FWA qualification.

Due to the propagation characteristics of High-Band frequencies, High-Band pre-qualification is more challenging than Mid-Band pre-qualification. Propagation modeling is more complicated for High-Band frequencies and needs to consider many more factors than Mid-Band such as vegetation, terrain shape, and obstructions. Measurement based pre-qualification is far more accurate and can be done by professional installers or by the end-user with a High-Band capable UE and a measurement application.

If both Mid-Band and High-Band frequencies are available for use by FWA then the pre-qualification can be simplified by only considering Mid-Band pre-qualification targets, with the High-Band usage being seen as opportunistic. A professional installer can measure the High-Band coverage in the installation location and provision a High-Band capable CPE if coverage is sufficient. Alternatively, a High-Band capable CPE can be sent to users for self-installation, and then Mid-Band can be utilized if High-Band coverage cannot be achieved. Note that self-installed CPEs may not be optimized and may result in more CPEs utilizing Mid-Band capacity. Once Mid-Band capacity limit is reached, FWA service deployments have to be pre-qualified for High-Band use only.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 7   High-Band Extended Propagation Delay Support Pre-Qualification Example

When introducing NR Standalone High-Band minimum viable product (MVP) for FWA deployment, it is assumed that no NR FR1 band or LTE band is available for FWA usage. For these deployments it is recommended that users are pre-qualified by professional installers using high-power outdoor CPEs. Pre-qualification targets should be chosen with some margins so that if interference or poor environmental conditions such as rain are present, SLA fulfillment for FWA users is still achievable.

### 2.2.2 Capacity and Dimensioning Considerations

When dimensioning for FWA many of the same principles of MBB should be followed, since the last hop will be the wireless radio link, which presents the greatest bottleneck to capacity. All FWA users need to share the radio resources, as well as with any MBB users if the network is shared, thus the performance for each user varies depending on the quality of the radio link. The goal of FWA capacity dimensioning is to determine the number of households that can be supported by the network.

For networks that are shared between MBB and FWA it is recommended to first identify the network capacity required by MBB. This can be done using typical MBB dimensioning methods as this accounts for MBB growth in the network. The extra capacity can then be utilized for FWA, and this capacity is used as the starting point for dimensioning FWA.

To begin dimensioning the FWA network an internal design target should be set, referred to as Rmin in this document, which is the minimum rate which should be achieved by all FWA users at any time of the day. The target is chosen by the operator to provide a minimum acceptable service for FWA, which varies between FWA service providers. For example, this may be chosen to maintain an SD video stream, an HD video stream, or multiple video streams, from as low as 2 Mbps or as high as 30 Mbps. Note that Rmin is different from the sold data rate for the FWA service and may be many magnitudes smaller.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 8   Network Capacity and Household Performance Variation

The figure above shows the difference in performance for different users in the network depending on radio link quality. Typical dimensioning targets should be set for the 5% worst-performing households, as these users will begin to experience unacceptable performance degradation before any of the other users in the network. The total system capacity can be determined by finding the minimum system load where Rmin can still be achieved for the 5% worst-performing households.

Note: It is assumed that CA is not being utilized at busy hours due to lack of free resources in the SCell, so only PCell dimensioning is recommended. However, the total peak rate can still be used to determine the sold data rate.

The result of pre-qualification and migrating the worst performing households from indoor to outdoor CPEs will alter the curve of the 5% worst-performing households considerably. It reduces the difference between the performance of the best and worst performing households, therefore this will allow for a much higher system capacity.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 9   Temporal Characteristics of FWA Demand and Performance

The figure above shows the temporal characteristics of a typical FWA network over an average day. The figure also shows the sold data rate, which should be achievable by households for most of the day. Dimensioning activities and system capacity should only be calculated for the time of highest demand, which is typically identified by the busy hour.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 10   Number of FWA Households Calculation Methods

Given the concepts of Rmin, system capacity, and busy hour consumption, there are three methods to calculate the number of households per site.

- The most conservative way to ensure Rmin is to assume all households are fully transmitting during busy hour. However, this is not recommended since data shows that only a fraction of households is active at any given time, therefore this would result in over-dimensioning.
- An overbooking factor can be used to account for the statistical multiplexing gain from having only a fraction of the users active at any given time. The overbooking factor is calculated based on network measurement data which takes into account the temporal characteristics of the number of active households and their demand. However, this may be difficult to predict when introducing a new FWA service.
- Data consumption statistics can also be used to determine the average busy hour demand. Typically measured through monthly consumption, the overall data consumption can be translated into average demand over the busy hour by estimating or measuring how much of the overall consumption is spent during busy hour periods (typically between 8-17%, for example) and calculating the average rate over the busy period. The average monthly consumption can be measured from the network or taken from neighboring fixed or FWA households. Some overhead can then be added to account for statistical variation.

#### 2.2.2.1 High-Band Capacity Considerations

Typical High-Band deployments utilize very large bandwidths compared to Mid-Band and can provide coverage to fewer households. When High-Band is deployed with Mid-Band it can be seen as method for offloading the Mid-Band, allowing more households to be served or higher data rates. Since it is unlikely that High-Band capacity will be limiting for most deployments, EN-DC or NR-DC downlink and uplink aggregation may also be turned off to increase Mid-Band or Low-Band capacity for users that do not have High-Band coverage or for MBB users.

Extending the coverage with the extended propagation delay support feature in High-Band will allow the High-Band to serve more households at greater distances. However, this feature requires near line-of-sight conditions near the base station and line-of-sight at further distances in order to be utilized, and the actual number of households that can connect in the full extended range coverage area may be quite limited, especially at distances greater than 2.5 km. The extended propagation delay support feature offloads some of the households in this range from Mid-Band or Low-Band, but Mid-Band or Low-Band capacity are still to be required for many of the households in this area. Additionally, High-Band frequencies are more susceptible to environmental changes and cell edge users may lose High-Band connectivity under poor environmental conditions such as rain. Mid-Band capacity should be evaluated to ensure these users can be served by Mid-Band in these poor conditions.

Since it is likely that there is sufficient High-Band capacity, the A4 threshold (NR-DC) or B1 threshold (EN-DC) can also be set to keep dual-connectivity configured even in poor coverage, since the high capacity available can offset the poor spectral efficiency of the user in such poor RF conditions. However, in high-throughput offerings it must be ensured that the cell-edge users can still achieve their expected minimum rate under high load in these conditions.

### 2.2.3 Densification

If FWA capacity is limited and more households can still be served in the market, then targeted network densification using street macro and small cells can be deployed. This enables greater market share in markets with high household density, such as dense suburban. This can be essential to provide greater High-Band coverage, which also offloads Mid-Band capacity to allow more users on Mid-Band spectrum. Densification may occur after already provisioning FWA users in the macro cell, and even if High-Band capable CPEs were provisioned, the high directionality of the antenna may require repositioning of the CPE device to achieve connectivity with the new densification site.

Figure 11   FWA Network Densification Example

## 2.3 Slicing and QoS

### 2.3.1 Slicing Framework

Various standardized and proprietary approaches are available to logically separate different tenants or services when sharing the same physical RAN, Transport or Core Network (CN) resources for operational, observability, business, or other reasons.

Network slicing for FWA specific services can be implemented using different identifiers:

- S-NSSAI (5GC)
- UUT (5GC+EPC)
- DNN (5GC)
- APN (EPC)
- RFSP (5GC+EPC)
- PLMN-ID (5GC+EPC)

Note: RAN slicing is an Ericsson Value Package (Advanced RAN Slicing) allowing flexible radio resource sharing across services using the same frequency spectrum in a radio cell

#### 2.3.1.1 NR RAN and CN Slicing Approaches for FWA and MBB
        Services

The figure below shows simplified NR RAN and CN Slicing approaches for FWA and MBB Services.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 12   NR Intra-PLMN RAN and CN Slicing Approaches for FWA and MBB Services

For NR NSA deployment, operators should use the Intra-PLMN slicing approaches based on APNs and/or EPC CUPS for FWA service deployments. For the RAN, spectrum sharing across services (FWA, MBB) with radio resource partitioning is preferred. Several of the Intra-PLMN slicing approaches can also be combined if needed. For example, a mobile operator might use EPC CUPS and share the same user plane functions (SGw-U and PGw-U) for multiple services (APNs) like FWA and MBB if these user plane functions provide enough capacity and connectivity to respective PDNs.

For NR SA deployment, slicing based on S-NSSAI is preferred. Using the S-NSSAI to partition RAN and core network resources does not mandate different PLMN-IDs as S-NSSAIs are always utilized within the scope of a particular PLMN. This might be referred to as Intra-PLMN slicing approach.

Note: With S-NSSAI based slicing, one single UE can be part of, and make use of multiple network slices.

For further details like network slice identifiers, network slicing procedures and RAN resource management, see the NR SA Network Slicing Guideline.

### 2.3.2 RAN Slicing

#### 2.3.2.1 Radio Resource Partitioning

The purpose of the NR Radio Resource Partitioning (RRP) feature is to ensure fairness in radio resource usage in a network where resources are shared between user categories, for example MBB and FWA. For FWA, this feature can be used to reserve radio resources for the FWA subscribers while attaining optimal use of the total resources.

RAN slicing, provided by the Radio Resource Partitioning feature, can be used to reserve spectrum in a partition for the FWA subscribers and MBB subscribers allowing each subscriber type to borrow free capacity from the other partition.

With RRP, free resources are shared among the partitions when available, while ensuring that each partition is allocated its configured share when required. Bearers in one partition are scheduled by QoS only in relation to other bearers in the same partition. This prevents lower QoS users in one partition being starved by higher QoS users in another partition.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 13   Radio Resource Partitioning Resource Usage Example

RRP can be configured based on SPID or PLMN for NR NSA. For NR SA the RRP configuration is based on S-NSSAI, PLMN or both.

Automated Radio Resource Partitioning is an enhancement which allows the automatic updating of resource shares of partitions. The shares will update according to a target average user throughput for the users assigned to the partition. Every 10 seconds the average user throughput for these users is calculated and if the measured average user throughput is lower than the target then the partition share is increased, or if it is higher than the target the partition share is decreased. A minimum and maximum share is configured so that these adjustments stay within defined limits.

Note: When using RRP for NSA with EN-DC, it might be required to have partitioning also configured on the eNodeB for the LTE anchor if the split bearer is also configuring user plane traffic on the LTE network. RRP for LTE has similar functionality to NR RRP, and uses SPID or PLMN for slice differentiation.

RRP is not available for NR High-Band yet.

For further details on the partitioning concepts and configurations, scheduling, partitioning of spectrum resources, see the NR SA Network Slicing Guideline.

#### 2.3.2.2 Partition Allocation

When configuring RAN slicing the MBB traffic must be analyzed to determine the minimum amount of spectrum needed to maintain acceptable MBB KPIs and allow for forecasted growth. The remaining resources can then be used for FWA and the maximum number of FWA households can be calculated. This should be done per sector, as the traffic requirements will change not just between each site but each sector as well.

When configuring RAN slicing the MBB traffic must be analyzed to determine the minimum amount of spectrum needed to maintain acceptable MBB KPIs and allow for forecasted growth. The remaining resources can then be used for FWA and the maximum number of FWA households can be calculated. This should be done per sector, as the traffic requirements will change not just between each site but each sector as well.

There are several different alternatives for providing resource protection for both MBB and FWA in a shared network, depending on the performance target for each service. One method is to configure radio resource partitioning for MBB only and FWA is configured with QoS-based features to provide a minimum performance in the unallocated spectrum, such as rate-based scheduling.

A partition can also be assigned for FWA users, with MBB left unallocated or with a dedicated partition as well. However, when introducing an FWA service it is likely that subscribers will be added slowly over time. If the partition is set to the maximum FWA capacity it will likely result in an over-dimensioned FWA service with very skewed KPIs favoring FWA over MBB until the number of FWA households approaches the maximum allowed. This method will also not modify traffic shares according to variations in the traffic, such as daily variations in busy hour between MBB and FWA, which may result in skewed KPIs at different times of the day.

If a partition is configured for FWA it is recommended to use automated radio resource partitioning. This feature will automatically adjust partition limits to achieve a target average user throughput for the service configured. The maximum limit may be set the same as the estimated resource percentage required for maximum number of households similar to a fixed partition but will optimize the resource usage when the number of FWA users and average demand is lower, freeing up more resources for MBB in an underutilized FWA sector. An example of this is shown below with MBB left unallocated.

Figure 14   Automated RRP Configuration Example

It is recommended to keep at least 20% margin for unallocated traffic to optimize scheduler usage and maintain expected partition performance when accounting for prioritized services and HARQ retransmissions. It is also recommended to keep as many resources as possible unallocated for greater scheduler flexibility and allow for more partitions to be added in the future as new services are added to the network. Partitions should only be put in place to provide a minimum required level of service.

### 2.3.3 QoS

To guarantee that mobile traffic is handled according to the needs of the offered services, QoS techniques are used for identifying and prioritizing different traffic and subscriber types.

The QoS framework and related scheduler configurations can be used to provide differentiated traffic handling and to have certain control over the distribution of the available radio resources. This allows a mobile operator to support services with different QoS requirements simultaneously over the same network.

To enable E2E QoS support for FWA, proper service flow mapping is recommended for FWA subscribers consuming the same services including Voice Telephony (VoNR, VoLTE, VoIP), IPTV, or other services (web-browsing, e-mail, etc.) accessible via CDNs or the Internet.

For further details see the E2E QoS Guideline.

#### 2.3.3.1 QoS Features

The Priority Controlled Scheduling feature enables the gNodeB to perform Absolute Priority Scheduling on the NR radio bearer level for different sets of users, and between different Data Radio Bearers of a UE. NR radio bearers with a higher absolute priority are scheduled before bearers with a lower absolute priority. The priority of a bearer is defined by the priority of its Priority Domain where the Priority Domain is derived from the Priority Level that is defined for the 5QI for the bearer. In NR SA deployments the priority can be based on 5QI and a network slice. For NR NSA deployments the priority can be based on QCI which is mapped to 5QI.

The NR Relative Priority Scheduling feature enables the gNodeB to schedule the resources on NR based on the relative priority and the Packet Delay Budget (PDB) of each Data Radio Bearer (DRB) within a priority domain. This enables operators to prioritize traffic between different sets of users, and between different DRBs of a UE. NSA and SA UEs can be configured separately by using network slicing.

The NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling feature allows the operator to change priority levels based on the achieved data rate of the user. Prioritized rate scheduling may be used to serve a QoS flow with high priority until a rate threshold is reached, after which it is served with low priority. Alternatively, soft rate throttling scheduling may be used to limit QoS flows to the rate threshold defined when under contention.

These features can be combined for different service types to finely tune the performance of the FWA users in relation to other services such as MBB. For example, an FWA 5QI may be configured with soft-rate throttling as part of NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling as well as a higher relative priority over MBB.

#### 2.3.3.2 QoS in NR NSA

For services requiring special E2E QoS treatment in radio, transport, and core network domains (for example IPTV), it is recommended to use dedicated bearers.

For dedicated bearers the bearer type (GBR or non-GBR) should be selected based on the requirements of the transported services and traffic types. GBR bearers should mainly be used for interactive, latency sensitive traffic flows.

It is not recommended to use GBR bearers as a general means to realize minimum bitrate guarantees for VAS for example FWA Internet connectivity services. This can unnecessarily waste radio resources (PRBs) in the RAN or lead to a more complex bearer Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) configuration.

Unlike MBB, FWA bearers are not strictly required to use the 3GPP standardized QCI values and related E2E QoS setup. As FWA services are deployed only in certain parts of a mobile network and roaming support is not required, operator defined QCIs with QoS characteristics as required by the offered FWA services can be configured.

There are also several reasons to solely use operator defined QCIs for most of the FWA bearers and services:

- RAN features can be tuned to realize a specific QoS, access and mobility behavior for FWA. For example, specific FWA services associated with operator-defined QCIs can be provided with minimum bitrate guarantees at radio scheduler-level or with threshold criteria determining the handover to neighboring cells and frequencies (see Service-Triggered Mobility).
- Certain performance measurements and counters in RAN can be evaluated based on QCIs. Operator defined QCIs allow performing measurements specifically for FWA independent from other services (for example, MBB) using the same RAN.
- Differentiated QoS treatment of FWA service flows can also be implemented in the backhaul transport network if needed, by mapping operator-defined QCIs to specific DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) controlling the QoS behavior in transport nodes.

Even though using operator defined QCI values, the QoS characteristics (Priority, ARP, and so on) for FWA service traffic types are recommended to follow the general 3GPP recommendations (TS 23.107, TS 23.203) and the corresponding E2E QoS solution guideline.

Moreover, for voice telephony the QoS properties used for voice signaling (SIP) and voice media are recommended to be aligned with GSMA IR.92 specification to secure the mandatory voice quality levels. Therefore, the QCIs and related QoS properties for bearers connecting to the FWA Voice APN are recommended not to be modified.

Operator-defined QCIs using values between 128 - 254 on default or dedicated EPS bearers are recommended to be used for FWA services requiring a specific QoS treatment in Radio, Transport or Core Networks.

Operator-defined QCIs are recommended to be only used for the Internet and VAS related bearers connecting to the FWA Data APN. VoLTE bearers connecting to the FWA Voice APN are recommended to use 3GPP standard QCIs.

The QoS characteristics of FWA services associated with operator-defined QCIs should primarily match the characteristics of similar services associated with 3GPP standardized QCIs in TS 23.107, TS 23.203.

Operator-defined QCIs for FWA services having similar QoS characteristics as corresponding MBB services using 3GPP standardized QCIs are recommended to be constructed according to the following scheme:

- Operator defined QCI = 128 + standardized 3GPP 23.203 QCI value

|     | Service           |   QCI |   Absolute Priority | Relative Priority   | Bearer              | APN   |
|-----|-------------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| MBB | Voice CP          |     5 |                   1 | N.A.                | Non-GBR (default)   | IMS   |
| MBB | Voice UP          |     1 |                   2 | N.A.                | GBR (dedicated)     | IMS   |
| MBB | Data              |     9 |                   9 | N.A.                | Non-GBR (default)   | Data  |
| FWA | Voice CP          |     5 |                   1 | N.A.                | Non-GBR (default)   | IMS   |
| FWA | Voice UP          |     1 |                   2 | N.A.                | GBR (dedicated)     | IMS   |
| FWA | IPTV              |   134 |                   6 | N.A.                | Non-GBR (dedicated) | Data  |
| FWA | Premium Internet  |   136 |                   9 | 1                   | Non-GBR (default)   | Data  |
| FWA | Standard Internet |   137 |                   9 | 2                   | Non-GBR (default)   | Data  |

Note: Voice is realized by VoLTE

An NR NSA gNodeB example QoS setting would be similar to the NR SA QoS gNodeB table below except for the following:

- Voice service which is handled entirely by the eNodeB
- IPTV, Premium and Standard Internet services QCIs received via X2 interface is mapped to a 5QI value, for example 5QI = QCI - 128

#### 2.3.3.3 QoS in NR SA

In NR SA the QoS framework and related scheduler configurations can be used to provide differentiated traffic handling and to have certain control over the distribution of the available radio resources. This allows mobile operators to support services with different QoS requirements simultaneously over the same network.

For further information see the E2E QoS Guideline, NR SA Network Slicing Guideline and the respective feature descriptions.

|     | Service           |   5QI |   Priority Level |   Priority Domain | QoS Flow Type   | DNN   |
|-----|-------------------|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| MBB | Voice CP          |     5 |               10 |                15 | Non-GBR         | IMS   |

Note: Voice is realized by VoNR

### 2.3.4 QoS and Slicing Performance Comparison

Since FWA is seen as a replacement to wired internet access the user has an expectation that the service performs similarly to a wired alternative such as cable or DSL. An MBB user typically expects service to vary often through location and time of day, whereas an FWA user typically expects a steady internet connection with a constant minimum throughput, regardless of time of day. This expectation should be maintained by the dimensioned Rmin (the minimum rate FWA users should always achieve).

To help ensure that the Rmin throughput is maintained for all users, the QoS and slicing can be tuned in several ways. However, it is important to note that the purpose of the QoS and slicing functionality is not to provide extra capacity or resources in the network, but rather to distribute the network resources to help maintain minimum service levels while providing fairness for both FWA and MBB in the network. Continuous monitoring of the network and proper dimensioning must be followed to ensure that KPIs and service levels are being met, and no QoS or slicing enforcement can replace this.

Capacity and Dimensioning Considerations

Observability and KPI Handling

#### 2.3.4.1 Equal Priority QoS, Shared MBB and FWA Slice

The most common approach for FWA in past deployments was that the best effort FWA offering treats FWA users the same as MBB users, giving them the same QoS profile (QCI/5QI) as a typical MBB user. This gives FWA users the same priority as MBB users during resource contention. However, due to the improved radio link from high-power indoor CPEs and outdoor CPEs, FWA users can expect a somewhat better throughput than mobile users due to the increased resource efficiency. This is the simplest approach to implement, as it requires no differentiation between FWA and MBB users, and the configuration is common across all sectors.

In networks with a high number of users and fluctuating resource demand it might be difficult to maintain SLAs for FWA users. Since there are typically many more mobile users in the network, a spike in usage from mobile users has a large impact on FWA users, as they have the same priority and receive the same number of resources as mobile users during this time. However, where a mobile user may not expect to have always consistently high throughput, a FWA user will notice a reduced throughput, even if only for a brief time, particularly if this causes certain services to stop running, such as IPTV.

The number of active FWA users is also typically easier to predict than the number of MBB users over time. It can be assumed that at any given time a certain percentage of the sold subscriptions are active at once, and although unlikely, in the worst case all sold subscriptions might be active simultaneously. However, MBB usage varies much more over time, and might have much more extreme changes in traffic due to events in the network, such as sporting events, public events, public transit entering or exiting coverage, and so on. All users will be impacted by these extreme changes in traffic, including FWA users.

It is important to note that although an FWA user's average resource consumption may be much higher than an MBB user's, they will not get any more resources at any given time than an active MBB user when configured with the same priority.

#### 2.3.4.2 Relative Priority QoS, Shared MBB and FWA Slice

Relative priority scheduling can be used to enhance best-effort FWA by prioritizing either MBB or FWA traffic by a fixed proportion for all users. This will give one user group consistently higher throughput than the other, regardless of how many users are active in the network of either type. This will require differentiation between FWA and MBB users by QCI/5QI, and the configuration will be common across all sectors with FWA.

It is not recommended to prioritize MBB traffic using relative priority scheduling as this will make it extremely difficult to achieve the minimum throughput required for FWA users during busy hours. This makes FWA performance even more sensitive to any changes in MBB traffic, which can be unpredictable. High FWA resource consumption might be addressed with this configuration, but it is unlikely to change this high consumption behavior and likely only results in an unacceptable performance for FWA users in busy hours and poor customer satisfaction.

Relative Priority Scheduling can instead be used to prioritize FWA traffic to reduce FWA sensitivity to changes in MBB traffic. Since MBB users are typically more tolerant to periods of lower throughput this can mitigate the impact of higher than expected congestion, since the FWA traffic can still maintain the expected minimum service with a sufficiently higher priority. For example, the network can be dimensioned to provide 3 Mbps to 95% of MBB users in the cell but Rmin may be determined to be 6 Mbps for FWA users. In this case, the FWA users can be assigned a relative priority weight of two times the MBB users', and this will help achieve the expected service under high congestion without needing to add extra capacity.

This will make the MBB users more susceptible to changes in the FWA network, and if more FWA users are active simultaneously than expected, a higher proportion of the resources may be allocated to FWA, resulting in a reduced MBB throughput. However, since the number of FWA users is typically less, and the number of users is much easier to predict than with MBB, this will have a relatively small impact on MBB users. This relative priority will also be enforced under medium and low load, giving more resources to FWA users even when they can achieve much more than Rmin, which may not be desirable.

#### 2.3.4.3 NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling

NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling can be used to provide service differentiation by elevating the priority of a user up to a configured rate. This can be done using either prioritized rate mode or soft-rate throttling mode. Both can be used to prioritize FWA to a configured rate, thus ensuring that FWA users are able to maintain a minimum service quality. This configured rate can be the same target rate used in dimensioning to ensure that FWA users can achieve Rmin.

Soft-rate throttling can be configured for an FWA service to provide default priority for FWA users up to the configured rate, but provide a lower priority when under contention once the configured rate is achieved. To ensure that FWA performance can be achieved a higher relative priority for FWA can be configured for FWA 5QIs so that FWA users will be prioritized up to their configured rate. If the measured rate for an FWA user is lower than the configured threshold the FWA user will be configured in the same priority domain as MBB but get proportionally more resources according to its higher relative priority. If the measured rate for an FWA user is above the configured threshold the user will be demoted to a lower priority domain and other traffic will be prioritized.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 15   Soft-Rate Throttling Description

The advantage of this configuration is that the FWA service will have high prioritization only up to the configured rate, and once this rate is achieved other services such as MBB will be prioritized. This will ensure that FWA users do not consume excessive resources but have a consistent level of performance even under contention. The FWA service should be dimensioned so that all active users should be able to meet their configured rate while still allowing enough resources for MBB users.

Since FWA is scheduled in the same priority domain as MBB up to the configured rate there is no risk of completely starving out MBB, but an over-dimensioned FWA sector or an abnormal surge in FWA traffic may negatively impact MBB performance. Radio resource partitioning can be configured for MBB traffic to protect MBB performance under these conditions.

A disadvantage of soft-rate throttling is that for heavily loaded cells the FWA users may only achieve up to their configured rate for long periods of time. Since all MBB traffic will be prioritized over FWA users that meet the configured rate, the FWA service will be sensitive in surges of MBB traffic or high MBB congestion, even though a minimum level of service will be maintained. Since the configured rate will typically be lower than the sold data rate it should still be considered an acceptable level of service for FWA subscribers.

Prioritized rate mode can also be configured for an FWA service to provide an elevated priority domain for FWA users until they reach the configured rate, after which they will be demoted into the same priority domain as MBB traffic. Relative priority can also be used to give higher priority to MBB in the same priority domain as FWA traffic that has achieved its prioritized rate to enable better MBB performance since the FWA service will always maintain its configured rate. A high relative priority for MBB will function similarly to soft-rate throttling by prioritizing MBB performance, although FWA users can still exceed their configured rate under contention.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 16   Prioritized Rate Description

Since FWA users are scheduled in a higher priority domain until the configured rate is met there is a possibility for an over-dimensioned sector or an abnormal surge in FWA traffic to completely starve out other services in a lower priority domain such as MBB. It is recommended to use Radio Resource Partitioning to protect these services if using prioritized rate mode.

Unlike other QoS methods, NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling can be used as well to provide fairness amongst FWA subscribers. Regardless of the radio link of the FWA users, each user will be prioritized up to the configured rate. Depending on the configuration users with a good radio link will not use more resources than required to meet the configured rate, allowing a more efficient usage of spectrum to achieve Rmin for all users.

It is highly recommended to configure resource starvation prevention if using NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling since a poorly placed CPE can have significant impact on the network. This will prevent individual users from consuming too many resources if they do not have a good radio link. The attributes DlResourceBasedPriority.dlDrbPriorityLimit and UlResourceBasedPriority.ulDrbPriorityLimit represent a percentage of total spectrum resources that can be utilized by a single user to achieve their configured rate. The attributes should be set so that a user with an acceptable radio link can achieve the configured rate but a user with a very poor radio link will not get elevated priority, such as a user that does not fall within the pre-qualification targets. If multiple cells are configured for FWA this can be scaled for different cell bandwidths using the attributes CellPriorityShift.cellDlDrbPriorityLimitBase and CellPriorityShift.cellUlDrbPriorityLimitBase.

Up to two DRBs can be configured for rate-controlled scheduling on a single UE, allowing different 5QIs to be configured for different service types such as internet service and IPTV. Each service 5QI can have its own configured rate.

For further details, see the NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling feature description.

Rate Throttling

#### 2.3.4.4 Radio Resource Partitioning

Resource partitions in the RAN can be configured for FWA traffic, MBB traffic, or both using Radio Resource Partitioning. QoS functionality can then be used to further differentiate between services within each partition and within the unallocated resources, including absolute and relative priority scheduling and rate-based scheduling.

Configuring a partition for FWA will provide protection for FWA traffic from surges in MBB traffic. In order to operate fairly and effectively, the partition limits must be carefully chosen in each sector with FWA. However, this requires constant monitoring and management, and has a higher O&amp;M cost than the QoS only solutions. Failure to set the limits appropriately might result in an over- or under-dimensioned network, with KPIs that might be very different for the two user groups. Additionally, if assumptions about consumption and busy hour usage are incorrect operator might see a high variance in KPIs. Therefore, it is recommended to use Automated Radio Resource Partitioning if configuring a partition for FWA.

Using Automated Radio Resource Partitioning allows dynamic changing of the partition limits according to the average user throughput for all users in the partition. A target throughput can be configured, as well as a minimum and maximum limit for the partition share. The maximum limit should be chosen as the partition share required to support the maximum number of FWA households, and the service should not be sold over this limit. Having the partitions adjust automatically based on demand simplifies the OAM compared to regular RRP and will provide much more consistent KPIs across all sectors. This also enables a simplified deployment model, where an entire region may have the same partitioning configuration regardless of current household penetration.

One drawback of automated radio resource partitioning is that there may be a large split in achieved throughput between the users with good radio link and poor radio link. Since the average user throughput is used to adjust partition shares this may result in some users achieving considerably less than the target average throughput, especially when other users with much better radio conditions are active. Therefore, the target average throughput should be higher than the dimensioned Rmin. An example of the spread in user throughput is shown in the figure below, where a 10mbps target throughput is configured.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 17   Automated RRP Throughput Spread

A partition may be defined for MBB as well as FWA, but if both are defined there should be at least 20% of resources left unallocated, and more if future partitions are planned. Alternatively, a partition can be created for only one service, leaving the other service unallocated. The RrpSchedulingPriority attribute can be configured with DEMOTED\_LOW to give partition members a lower priority in the unallocated spectrum once it has exceeded the configured partition, ensuring that the unallocated service will get priority in the unallocated spectrum. For example, an FWA partition can be configured with 40% maximum with a resource policy of DEMOTED\_LOW and the MBB can remain unallocated. Under contention, MBB will always have priority in the unallocated spectrum, and FWA will always have priority up to its partition share. Alternatively, the RrpSchedulingPriority can be configured with DEMOTED\_NORMAL and the unallocated service can be configured with either equal priority QoS for an even distribution of the unallocated spectrum or a higher relative priority QoS to allow higher utilization of the unallocated spectrum.

### 2.3.5 Slicing Limitations Mitigation with Carrier
      Aggregation

In the current implementation of the carrier aggregation features in FR1 there are limitations for radio resource partitioning with carrier aggregation as follows:

- When RRP and CA are configured simultaneously, radio resource partitioning is only enforced in the PCell which means SCell traffic is not partitioning-aware.
- A dedicated CA partition can be configured for SCell traffic, and if this is not configured all SCell traffic is treated as unallocated traffic by RRP.

When configuring CA for both FWA and MBB, the PCell for FWA traffic is recommended to always remain on the capacity band (Mid-Band TDD for example) through traffic steering. MBB CA can be configured as normal, and the PCell can be allowed on the capacity band or coverage band depending on whether the UE has good or poor coverage.

To mitigate the limitation of CA and RRP on the capacity bands, SCell traffic can be left as residual traffic only or have a very small partition configured for the SCell traffic (&lt;10%). MBB and FWA PCell traffic can be protected by assigning each group a partition. In this case the SCell utilization can be seen as purely opportunistic to keep dimensioned priorities for each user group. The coverage bands can be configured as SCell candidates only for MBB to reserve usage of low-band spectrum for MBB using User- and Service- Specific Carrier Aggregation. Alternatively, these bands can be configured as SCell candidates for FWA as well, and a partition can be configured for MBB on these bands to prevent SCell traffic from impacting the PCell MBB traffic.

## 2.4 Main RAN Features Relevant for FWA

For providing a level of FWA service like traditional Fixed Broadband, it is crucial to manage radio resources carefully, to ensure the level of service without having too much impact on existing mobile traffic, using, for example, QoS and network slicing. Some RAN features are highly recommended to manage radio resources to provide the best user experience. Other features are available to increase capacity and improve spectral efficiency for FWA. These features are used in a similar way as in traditional Mobile Broadband deployments but are especially important for FWA. This section briefly highlights the main RAN features relevant for FWA. See  RAN Features for a more general overview of FWA relevant features.

Planning and Deployment

### 2.4.1 UE Grouping Framework

The UE Grouping Framework is a basic feature, and it implements differentiated UE group handling in terms of configuration and observability for NR.

With the UE Grouping Framework, operators can classify UEs into UE groups based on the following selection criteria:

- NR SA: 5QI, ARP, PLMN, RFSP, S-NSSAI, Masked IMEI-SV, Cell Group Role (MCG or SCG), RRC establishmentCause or RRC resumeCause information element, and RedCap UE
- NR NSA: QCI, ARP, PLMN, SPID, CG Role (SCG), and Masked IMEI-SV

A UE Group Evaluation is typically triggered at the following points:

- RRC Idle to RRC Connected state transfer
- Incoming mobility event
- QoS Flow add, remove or modify

The UE Grouping Framework supports the following UE group types:

- Preference UE Group
- UE Group
- UE Configuration Group
- UE Mobility Group
- UE Service Group
- UE Admission Group

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 19   UE Grouping Framework Overview

The Preference UE Group type targets at permanent configurations and has precedence over other group types to secure the use of a prioritized configuration. For example, FWA can be used as one dedicated Preference UE Group.

The UE Group type is used for temporary configurations and A/B-testing. A/B-testing makes it possible to compare configuration options without separate reference and measurement periods, as the observability of the different configuration options can be monitored simultaneously. The UE Group type also makes it possible to gradually introduce functionality among users of a selected group. For example, this functionality can be utilized in FWA to optimize the FWA parameter settings.

The UE Configuration Group types enable differentiated configuration for each UE group, based on, for example, different PLMNs or services. It targets long-term or permanent configurations. For example, this group can be used to steer FWA subscribers to a certain frequency band or to define which FWA service (for example VoNR) prefers a certain frequency band.

In addition, the UE Grouping Framework provides observability per UE group using EBS-N flexible counters.

For detailed information, see the UE Grouping Framework feature description and related feature descriptions of features making use of the UE Grouping Framework.

### 2.4.2 Carrier Aggregation

Carrier aggregation allows for higher peak throughput by aggregating multiple Component Carriers (CCs) in both downlink and uplink. Carrier aggregation also improves system performance, providing a more efficient use of scattered spectrum assets. Additionally, carrier aggregation between FDD low-band and TDD mid-band using FDD as PCell can improve the coverage area of TDD for downlink traffic.

In Inter-Baseband DL CA variants, the partner gNodeBs are connected by an E5 link through Advanced RAN Coordination.

For more information, see Elastic RAN and Advanced RAN Coordination Guideline.

Carrier Aggregation is recommended when a very high data rate FWA service is offered, and one single cell may not be able to provide such high peak data rate performance for the sold FWA offering (e.g., 1 Gbps downlink). It is also recommended when the FWA service is targeted for multiple cells, as it provides greater efficiency of spectrum resources and improves end-user performance.

For high-band deployments it is recommended to use both downlink and uplink carrier aggregation for high-band cells to make the most efficient of the large high-band spectrum resources.

In mid-band deployments, TDD as PCell is recommended for FWA users, as FWA users can benefit from much higher throughput due to the broader spectrum and mid-band usage will be optimized. Depending on the pre-qualification targets used the FWA service may be sold to households in the coverage extension region as well. Users in this region can utilize FDD as PCell and provide downlink aggregation on the TDD mid-band, but this may result in congestion on the FDD for both downlink and uplink.

Although most FWA deployments are limited in downlink resources, Uplink Carrier aggregation may be required to provide sufficient uplink performance for users at mid-band TDD cell edge. This may also be required to prevent an impact to uplink performance when migrating from NSA to SA, since the low-band uplink on the SCell may be needed to replace the LTE anchor carrier uplink in NSA.

Currently only F+T and T+F uplink CA is supported, so to use uplink CA an FDD carrier must be configured for use as SCell. Note that downlink CA will be required when uplink CA is configured, which may result in usage of the downlink resources on FDD for FWA. Depending on number of CCs supported by UE capability and the cell configuration for CA, the FDD SCell may not be selected by NR Traffic Steering, which will result in no uplink carrier aggregation being configured.

The User- and Service-Specific Carrier Aggregation feature offers the possibility to support different Carrier Aggregation configurations based on UE group definition, which is realized by the UE grouping framework. The benefit is that CA can be configured uniquely for different UE groups defined, allowing for different SCell candidates and CA capability for MBB or FWA, or between different FWA groups.

One example of a service-specific configuration is shown below. Depending on the operator's radio spectrum usage policy, there might be requirement to exclude FWA from utilizing FDD coverage cells, while retaining these cells for MBB users. Adding the F1 ARFCN value to the blockedSCellFreqList for the CaCellProfileUeCfg assigned to the FWA user group will block this cell from being used as an SCell for FWA users, while keeping it as an SCell candidate for MBB.

Figure 20   NR DL Carrier Aggregation Combinations for FWA

The feature NR QoS-Aware Downlink Carrier Aggregation provides the Quality of Service (QoS) based traffic differentiation for the external traffic in SCell in the FR1 downlink inter-gNodeB carrier aggregation case. It also provides the ability to configure an operator defined QoS priority for external traffic in SCell. The external traffic in SCell refers to the CA traffic forwarded from SpCell to SCell when SpCell and SCell nodes are connected over ARC i.e., using E5 interface.

This feature adds the QoS awareness in CA over E5 with the following functionalities depending on the selected configuration.

- Ability to configure a fixed priority for the external traffic in an SCell
- Ability to support dynamic priority for the external traffic in an SCell
- Provides a QoS aware traffic differentiation for the external traffic in an SCell

SCell traffic does not distinguish between different RAN slices, so Radio Resource Partitioning differentiation is only supported on the PCell. All SCell traffic will be treated as unallocated resources unless an SCell partition is defined. If an SCell partition is defined, then all SCell traffic will be allocated to that partition regardless of whether it is allocated to an MBB or FWA partition in the PCell.

For more detailed information on CA in NR FR1 and CA in NR FR2 see the latest CPI guidelines and feature descriptions.

Slicing Limitations Mitigation with Carrier Aggregation

#### 2.4.2.1 Uplink Single-User MIMO and Carrier Aggregation

Certain FWA CPEs have three transmit antennas that may utilize both uplink carrier aggregation and uplink single-user MIMO when connected in NR SA. Two transmit antennas can be configured for 2-layer SU-MIMO in TDD and one antenna can be configured for the FDD Scell. This is a unique capability only for FWA devices supporting 3 Tx antennas and enables much greater uplink performance for FWA users.

3 Tx-capable CPE devices can support simultaneous configuration of uplink CA and uplink single-user MIMO when both features are activated. In this configuration the PCell must be in mid-band TDD and the SCell in low-band FDD, and the Pcell will be configured for two-layer single-user MIMO. For 2 Tx-capable devices only uplink CA will be configured on the UE if both features are activated.

### 2.4.3 EN-DC

The figure below shows a simplified view of the EN-DC architecture focusing on control plane and user plane traffic.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 21   EN-DC Overview

The eNodeB serves as the FWA CPE anchor point and handles related control plane signaling traffic for both LTE and NR services.

The User Plane Data Radio Bearer can be set up either as a split-bearer (using LTE radio resources, NR radio resources, or both) or as an LTE-only bearer (using only LTE radio resources). It is possible to define which services use either LTE or NR bearers per QCI. The licensed feature NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile can also utilize the UE Grouping Framework to provide a differentiated configuration for many dual-connectivity functions based on UE groups. This allows for tuning the dual connectivity configuration for FWA users based on operator requirements without impacting MBB using a defined FWA UE group. UE group differentiation has been added for the following functions:

- Downlink PDCP aggregation
- Switching of downlink MCG and SCG resources of the secondary node terminated split DRB
- Downlink flow control
- Aperiodic CSI periodicity
- Automatic Queue Management (AQM)
- Uplink out-of-order delivery

As one example, in a FWA deployment the gNodeB can be configured to use only NR in the downlink direction for FWA users while reserving LTE resources entirely for MBB data users. In this instance DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed should be set to false for the FWA UE group and UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpPreferredCg should be set to SCG to prioritize NR usage. Uplink aggregation and flow control is not configured through NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile and is currently only configurable per 5QI. See NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile for more information.

High-Band FWA Use Case

### 2.4.4 NR-DC

The figure below shows a simplified view of the NR-DC architecture focusing on control plane and user plane traffic.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 22   NR-DC Overview

A NR-DC-capable FWA CPE operating in NR SA mode may be connected to a gNodeB with FR1 frequencies. The FWA CPE can connect to another gNodeB with FR2 frequencies if in High-Band coverage.

Similar to EN-DC, using NR-DC the User Plane Data Radio Bearer can be set up as a split-bearer. It is possible to define which services use which NR bearer per 5QI. It is also possible to use the NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature to provide differentiated configuration of NR-DC using the UE grouping framework.

For example, it is possible to configure mid-band and high-band PDCP aggregation by configuring DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed to true but prioritize high-band utilization for FWA by configuring UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggCgPrio to SCG\_PRIO and UserPlaneProfileUeCfg .dlPdcpPreferredCg to SCG. The buffer for aggregation activation can also be extended to only use FR1 resources for packets waiting a long time in the queue by setting UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggActTime to a larger number.

There is also possibility to configure NR-DC together with FR1 Carrier Aggregation, which will optimize MCG selection for aggregated peak data rate service while maintaining SN greedy MCG+SCG selection.

Such network configuration will bring value to FWA service performance with sustained high data rates on available FR1 carrier resources after SN Release, when FR2 coverage might be lost due to poor radio conditions (e.g., heavy rain, fog, wind-induced vibration, etc.).

For further details see NR-NR Dual Connectivity.

High-Band FWA Use Case

### 2.4.5 Voice over NR (VoNR)

To enable a Voice VAS for FWA in a NR SA deployment, VoNR can be used. VoNR is assumed to be supported by the network and the FWA devices (according to GSMA NG.114).

Note: EPS fallback to VoLTE in a NR SA deployment can result in undesirable behavior impacting the EPS and LTE radio resource utilization for MBB users. Using VoLTE, FWA subscribers might be pushed back to LTE for other services like internet as well.

For further details regarding VoNR guidelines and recommendations see 5G Voice SA RAN Solution Guideline.

### 2.4.6 NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access

Standalone deployment of NR High-Band for FWA enables a self-contained NR radio access network for FWA which can operate without using EN-DC or NR-DC. FWA CPEs can attach directly to the NR High-Band PCell, perform the random-access procedure, and get the radio resource control connected. This allows for example to deploy FWA without the complexity of using anchor bands to reach the target capacity layer or in areas in which non-Ericsson radio equipment has been deployed.

In NR Standalone High-Band only FWA deployment, subscribers will not have EN-DC or NR-DC to provide robustness or an option to fall back to low-band or mid-band cells. High power CPEs and good line of sight are required to achieve good connectivity, and pre-qualification will be required to determine if a household can achieve reliable connectivity.

Note: NR Standalone High-Band for FWA has several limitations on both hardware and software support, including mobility and supported radio products.

For details and full list of limitations, see NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access feature description.

### 2.4.7 Massive MIMO

Massive MIMO provides flexible cell coverage for different environments with cell shaping, enhanced capacity and data rate coverage with beamforming. Depending on NR deployments in High-Band, Mid-Band or Low-Band different Massive MIMO features are utilized.

FWA deployments often target suburban or rural environments with relatively low buildings and large inter-site distances, and most CPE units are distributed vertically very few degrees apart, seen from the base station. To form a beam to target this small vertical distribution, it is best to use a high vertical column that creates a high-gain, vertically narrow beam, fixed in the vertical plane, and still covering all households. The beneficial horizontal beamforming capability is then achieved by expanding the array in the horizontal domain by adding individually controllable sub-array columns.

RAN Features

#### 2.4.7.1 Single-User MIMO and Beamforming

MIMO allows better spectral efficiency by using multipath propagation to transmit multiple data streams on the same frequency. As most CPEs are MIMO-capable it is recommended that the minimum radio capability be matched to the number of layers supported by the CPE.

Further improvements to SU-MIMO are available with the Advanced Antenna System (AAS) radios with beamforming and cell-shaping. This increases throughput performance due to improved spectral efficiency with increased SINR. This is achieved using multiple transmit antennas to create beams toward scheduled UEs in the downlink, while reducing interference in the uplink. This enables much more capacity for FWA and allows for a wider geographical area coverage that can be deployed with good radio link.

Additional features are available to improve the throughput performance, for example Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band. This license-controlled feature uses reciprocity-based beamforming to increase the downlink throughput in good to medium channel conditions which is applicable to FWA based on pre-qualification measures. This can provide better downlink throughput and capacity compared to codebook-based transmission. For this feature FWA CPEs would need to support Sounding Reference Signal (SRS). The SRS transmitted by the CPE is the basis for channel estimation that can be used to determine the beamforming weights of downlink transmission.

Related Information:

RAN Features

#### 2.4.7.2 Multi-User MIMO

Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is a feature introduced for Advanced Antenna System (AAS) radios that uses beamforming and spatial diversity to schedule multiple users on the same time and frequency resource. MU-MIMO can only be configured under specific conditions, and the selection of layers and rank is dynamic based on channel conditions, spatial diversity, and UE capability. This often results in dynamic switching between SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO modes, depending on conditions. Since FWA CPEs are fixed and are expected to typically experience good channel conditions, FWA users are more likely to be eligible for MU-MIMO scheduling, and FWA networks are more likely to achieve higher usage of MU-MIMO layers.

Similarly to Single-User MIMO, an additional feature is available to improve the throughput performance, Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band. This license-controlled feature uses reciprocity-based beamforming to increase the downlink throughput in good to medium channel conditions which is applicable to FWA based on pre-qualification measures. For details, see Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band.

### 2.4.8 Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band

The Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature improves cell coverage in High-Band targeting high-powered FWA devices by extending the cell range of PRACH preamble format A3 and introducing PRACH preamble format C2. Several kilometers of cell range can be achieved with high-powered outdoor CPEs connected in line-of-sight.

The feature requires modifying the gap symbols between uplink and downlink, and the amount of gap symbols required depends on the configurable cell range. Since less symbols are available for scheduling there is a degradation in overall system capacity that increases with the cell range configured. The cell range can be configured according to the Inter-Site-Distance (ISD) of the deployment or the A4/B1 thresholds defined for dual-connectivity.

For further detailed information see Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band and 5G Mobility and Traffic Management Guideline.

Note that power classes for FR2 are specified in 3GPP TS 38.101-2.

### 2.4.9 High-Power UE Support in NR

High Power UE in NR supports power class 2 (26 dBm) and power class 1.5 (29 dBm) compared to the default power class (23 dBm). This way, it increases uplink coverage and uplink edge throughput. The function is supported in NR FR1 TDD, in connected mode and idle mode. The PCell band must be high power-operable to use the functionality.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 23   High Power UE Support

The following KPIs are assumed to be improved:

- for NR SA e.g. DRB Accessibility, DRB Retainability
- NR NSA: e.g. Average DL MAC DRB Throughput, Average UL MAC UE Throughput, DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS

For further detailed information see NR Standalone feature description.

Note that power classes for FR1 are specified in 3GPP TS 38.101-1.

## 2.5 Core Network Considerations

Providing broadband connectivity as well as access to voice or other content services for FWA impacts the following areas in the Evolved Packet System (EPS) and 5G Core (5GC):

- Subscriber and Service Management FWA users need specific subscription parameters (for example S-NSSAI, SPID, Location Based Access) addressing their radio access, service, or charging requirements among others.
- Gateway, UPF selection and Control Plane, User Plane function placement As the current data consumption of Fixed Broadband network users is roughly 10+ times higher than that of Mobile Broadband network users, the placement of user plane functions will in some cases change from a centralized to a distributed setup with the gateways being positioned closer to the users.
- APNs and DNNs, Network Slices, Bearers and QoS It is recommended to use dedicated APN or DNN and a dedicated network slice for FWA. In addition, a specific service to Bearer or QoS mapping is suggested for FWA subscribers consuming the same services including Voice Telephony (VoNR, VoLTE, VoIP), IPTV, or other services (web-browsing, e-mail, etc.) accessible via CDNs or the Internet.
- Policy and Charging Control (PCC) Policies need to be provisioned and enforced according to the service sold to FWA subscribers. For data rate-based connectivity services, policies controlling the uplink and downlink data rates are needed. Volume-limited connectivity services require additional policies tracking the data consumption per subscriber. Service usage and data consumption statistics need to be transferred to the charging and billing systems for payment related settlements.
- IMS interworking for VoIP services VoIP services are important VAS widely required by FWA residential users and are usually bundled with FWA basic internet connectivity services. For mobile operators providing FWA, VoNR (NR SA) and VoLTE (NR NSA) support becomes essential for VoIP services.

There are several functional add-ons relevant to the packet core network, which are required or beneficial for FWA deployments. The following list provides examples of such features. For feature availability and details, see the respective EPC and 5GS CPI documentation.

- Policy control - to monitor volume buckets and enforce uplink/downlink bitrate control for different sold data rates which FWA users can subscribe to.
- For NR SA:
    - Flexible selection of UPF - based on the following:
        - DNN,
        - Location,
        - NSSAI,
        - Mapped UUT,
        - a combination of the DNN, location, and the NSSAI,
        - a combination of the DNN, location, and mapped UUT
- For NR NSA:
    - Flexible selection of SGw and PGw - based on user location, topology and service information
    - EPC Control Plane User Plane Separation (CUPS) - providing flexible selection of EPC UP functions based on load, UE usage type, gateway and CPE location, or service information
    - Adaptive paging control for FWA CPEs - reducing or eliminating CPE device paging attempts due to lack of device mobility in FWA deployments

### 2.5.1 Geo-Locking

Operators may require using the CPE only in certain areas especially for non-mounted (primarily indoor) CPEs.

For NR NSA deployments LTE related Core Network functionality could be used for geo-locking, for example Presence Reporting Area (based on cell, eNodeB or gNodeB Identity, Tracking Area (TA)), Roaming Restriction (based on TA), Regional Restriction (based on TA).

For NR SA deployments, geo-locking can be implemented by one of the following options:

- Regional Subscription Area Support (Based on TA) The Regional Subscription Area Support feature in AMF allows the operator to restrict network access for FWA CPEs in both idle and connected mode based on TAs. Regional subscription areas can be defined in which network access is either allowed or rejected for a specific subscriber. FWA CPEs trying to access a not allowed area will receive a rejection message containing a 'Tracking area not allowed cause code'.
- Presence Reporting Area (PRA)(based on cell, gNodeB Identity, Tracking Area (TA)) The PRA feature enables the AMF and SMF to determine the CPE presence state. The CPE presence state can be reported to network functions to apply policy control. As a result of this procedure the CPE access might be allowed, restricted (hard locking) or allowed with limited throughput (soft locking).

For feature availability and details, see the respective 5GS CPI documentation.

### 2.5.2 Rate Throttling and QoS Modification

FWA subscriptions are commonly structured around a maximum data rate offering. For a non-GBR bearer, data rate enforcement is implemented at PDU Session level using a Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (Session-AMBR): each PDU Session of a UE can be associated with an Uplink Session-AMBR and/or a Downlink Session-AMBR to limit the bit rate that can be expected to be provided across all non-GBR QoS flows.

The subscribed Session-AMBR is a subscription parameter retrieved by the SMF from UDM during PDU Session establishment. Session-AMBR is specific to the PDU Session, not service specific. As such, when FWA provider offers several connectivity services with different data rates through a single Data DNN, the subscribed Session-AMBR must be adjusted by the PCF based on service profiles. At session establishment, the SMF sends the subscribed Session-AMBR to the PCF which is then either accepted or modified, returning an authorized Session-AMBR to the SMF. The SMF then instructs the UPF to make sure the aggregated uplink and downlink maximum bit rates do not exceed the Session-AMBR for the PDU Session. The SMF also notifies the UE of the Authorized Session-AMBR through the AMF.

Defining a maximum downlink data rate in UPF enforces the data rate based on the offering and avoids extra load on the backhaul transport network compared to enforcing in gNodeB only. For uplink traffic, enforcing in the UPF does not have much impact so the UE has to support and apply the uplink Session-AMBR parameter to limit the traffic rate.

FWA subscriptions follow the same paradigm as fixed broadband where no limitation is applied to the traffic volume. However to avoid abuse, volume-based enforcement can be applied with a high data cap, for example 2TB per month. This usage monitoring involves the SMF and PCF: the SMF provides regular updates about volume usage to the PCF for the PDU Session. The PCF refreshes the corresponding usage accumulators by adding the information received to the information previously stored in the accumulation repository. When the usage limit configured for the subscriber are surpassed, the PCF takes actions and updates the Authorized Session-AMBR to limit the data rate of the FWA subscriber, as shown in figure below. At the end of the defined period, the usage accumulator is reset by the PCF and the initial conditions are restored for the subscriber.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 24   Rate Throttling - Volume-Based Enforcement

Additionally, the PCF can also trigger a QoS modification request for a subscriber that has exceeded the usage limit. This can be used to change the QoS assigned to a user that has exceeded the limit, changing them to a lower priority QoS. For example, an FWA user configured with rate-based scheduling can be modified to use the same QoS as MBB once they exceed their usage limit. The basic feature NR Dynamic QoS Modification also allows the QoS to be modified for users in connected mode on the gNodeB.

More details can be found in Usage Monitoring PCF.

## 2.6 Traffic Management

When deploying FWA it is very important to steer the FWA users to the appropriate cells to optimize performance for FWA and MBB. Operators may require a separate mobility and traffic management configuration for FWA and will typically steer FWA to the NR capacity bands. The operator might also prohibit FWA users from connecting to the coverage bands, configuring them only for use by MBB.

In NSA, mobility for the anchor carrier is configured in the eNodeB. If the target anchor carriers are the same for both MBB and FWA then the mobility configuration can be shared by both user groups. If separate anchor carriers are to be considered for FWA, these can be configured using the Subscriber-Triggered Mobility and Service-Triggered mobility features in the eNodeB. Detailed configuration details can be found in the 5G Mobility and Traffic Management Guideline.

For NR traffic management the following features can be configured in the gNodeB:

- User- and Service-Specific Mobility (NR NSA and NR SA)
- NR Mobility (NR NSA and NR SA)
- NR Traffic Steering (NR SA)

Additionally, the traffic management will also affect the configuration of the following features:

- EN-DC
- NR-DC
- Carrier Aggregation

FWA traffic management is a subset of the general NR NSA and NR SA traffic steering aspects outlined in the NR Traffic Steering Solution Guideline and 5G Mobility and Traffic Management Guideline.

### 2.6.1 User- and Service-Specific Mobility (NR SA)

User- and Service-Specific Mobility uses the UE grouping framework to define a unique traffic management configuration for different user groups in the network. The feature allows to set separate attributes for FWA mobility and traffic steering that are unique from MBB.

The feature does not introduce new attributes, but instead allows group adaptability of MO profiles used by NR Mobility and NR Traffic Steering. The following figure shows configuration profiles and attributes that are used by the NR Traffic Steering and NR Mobility features. These profiles are generally referenced from the NRCellCU, NRFreqRelation and EutranFreqRelation MOs under the GNBCUCPFunction MO. The figure also shows the profiles that are group adaptable using User- and Service-Specific Mobility.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 25   Configuration Profiles for NR Mobility and NR Traffic Steering

### 2.6.2 NR Mobility

NR Mobility provides the following functions in NSA:

- Intra-Frequency Mobility
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

NR Mobility provides the following functions in SA:

- Idle Mode Mobility
- Idle Mode Steering
- Cell Reselection Priority at UE Release
- Intra-Frequency Mobility
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

Although the users are fixed it is recommended to configure intra-frequency mobility similarly to MBB to provide resiliency in case of coverage issues from the serving cell. This should not typically occur, and may indicate an issue in the CPE placement, pre-qualification, or serving cell connectivity. CPEs with directional antennas may not have coverage from neighboring sites and may require inter-frequency mobility for resiliency instead.

Idle mode mobility, idle mode steering, and cell reselection priority at UE release should be configured to steer FWA to the target frequencies, usually the capacity layer. As this is often the mobility strategy for MBB there may not be a need to configure unique idle mode mobility parameters for FWA. However, if the FWA idle mode steering differs from MBB then a unique cell reselection priority list can be configured in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.freqPrioListNR and TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.freqPrioListEUtran MOs if the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.actionAtRelease attribute is set to PRIORITY\_LIST.

These reselection priorities will be considered until the t320 timer (TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.t320) expires, so it is recommended to set this to the max value (180). When the t320 timer expires, the UE selects a cell based on the SIB priority.

Mobility Control at Poor Coverage can be configured in three different ways for FWA users:

1. Configure the same mobility thresholds used by MBB. This is the simplest configuration and does not require User- and Service-Specific Mobility. FWA users will use the same RSRP search zones to perform handover in case of interference or obstruction in the serving cell. This may result in unwanted handovers if users are positioned at the edge of the desired FWA cell (ie. mid-band) but will provide resilience to maintain connectivity for FWA devices.
2. Disable inter-frequency handover to all cells not designated for FWA. To prevent FWA users from accessing unwanted cells such as the coverage layer then the UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell parameter can be set to false for all unwanted bands in the NRFreqRelation for the configured FWA cell(s). This will completely prevent inter-frequency handover in case of poor coverage, and the user will stay on the FWA cell until they experience radio link failure.
3. Set unique mobility thresholds for FWA. The RSRP search zone for Mobility Control at Poor Coverage can be modified for FWA to only perform handover near critical coverage rather than prohibiting inter-frequency handover completely. This will still encourage connectivity to the target FWA cells for as long as possible but the UE will not experience radio link failure at critical poor coverage.

Additionally, if the Multi-Layer Coordination is not configured in NR Traffic Steering, for example in deployments without Carrier Aggregation, the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage can be configured in the cells not targeted for FWA usage to perform handover at UE connection to the target FWA cells. Specific A1/A2/A5 thresholds can be configured for FWA so that the devices are actively pushed away even though having good coverage through the serving cell frequency if there is a suitable FWA cell in coverage.

### 2.6.3 NR Traffic Steering

NR Traffic Steering aims at maximizing UE peak data rate based on UE capabilities, carrier resource availability and operators' preferences for network configurations. NR Traffic Steering provides the following functions:

- Multi-Layer Coordination
- Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility
- Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover
- Traffic Steering Cell Reselection Priority at UE Release

The Multi-Layer Coordination (MLC) is one of the most recommended functions from NR Traffic Steering Value Package, which can be used to steer FWA specific UE group towards NR capacity layer PCells and selects available SCells for NR CA, with the goal to achieve highest estimated throughput in NR SA configuration.

The FWA specific traffic steering and QoS profile can be implemented based on UE grouping Framework, which is quite suitable for the deployment scenario with a mixture of eMBB and FWA traffic in the network.

MLC includes such Serving Cell Selection procedure to find the best possible serving cell set according to the UE capabilities and supported network configuration.

During the preparation of candidate cells for FWA, PCell and SCell candidates are selected based on freq/cell relations in MOM configuration, which will:

1. Exclude unavailable cells/carriers.
2. Exclude not allowed cells/carriers.
3. Exclude cells not supporting UE configured slice(s).

Serving Cell Selection for candidate cell set can be based on such information like cell/carrier bandwidth, channel quality (both DL and UL), cell Load status (DL only), UE capabilities, etc.

In typical network configurations, MLC selects the best serving cell set (PCell and SCells) for UEs to gain high data rate in optimized frequency layer. To ensure that only the preferred cells are chosen for PCell selection at the initial UE connection for FWA service, the TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.pCellAllowed should be set to FALSE on the corresponding NRFreqRelation MO instances for the cells which are not targeted for FWA deployment.

It is recommended to only use SCell Reselection for FWA service deployment while keeping PCell unchanged, which has such advantages:

- Enable switch to best cell set without handover.
- Reduce the total amount of handover triggered by Multi-Layer Coordination.
- Improve the utilization efficiency of spectrum resources in the network.

To keep PCell unchanged on NR TDD capacity layer for FWA service during the Serving Cell Selection procedure, it is recommended to set TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.mlcAllowedCellSetChangeAction attribute as SCELL\_RESELECTION for such PCell candidate, so that the SCell selection from Candidate Cell Set is only based on the current PCell. In this way, there can be reduced amount of PCell traffic handovers triggered by Multi-Layer Coordination, with reselection of SCells only during the best Candidate Cell Set Evaluation.

For the other cells which are not considered as PCell candidate for FWA service, TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.mlcAllowedCellSetChangeAction attribute should be set as HO\_AND\_SCELL\_RESELECTION. With this configuration on such cells(e.g., NR FDD coverage bands) which are not considered as suitable PCell, MLC can help to push the FWA users back to the optimized NR TDD Mid-Band as PCell when the capacity layer TDD cell is recovered from the temporary resource outages or coverage problem.

NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination (Advanced MLC) feature introduces load awareness in downlink for traffic steering functions like Multi-Layer Coordination and Dynamic Cell Set Change during mobility and at initial SCell selection.

Advanced MLC with load aware traffic steering is beneficial for enhanced FWA service in DL traffic, especially under highly loaded network environment.

The figure below shows one typical Advanced MLC configuration example, where SCell Reselection is triggered during the Serving Cell Selection procedure, when high cell load is identified with calculation based on weighting function using load factor.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 26   Load Aware Traffic Steering with Serving SCell Reselection for FWA Service

To enable the Advanced MLC feature, the TrafficSteering.dlCellLoadAware attribute should be set to TRUE. To steer FWA service traffic towards the optimized target cell frequencies(e.g., the preferred capacity layer)in connected mode, the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.mlcPeriodicEnabled attribute should be set to TRUE for periodic Multi-Layer Coordination.

The Cell Reselection Priority (CRP) handling at UE (RRC) release for MLC can improve the chance for FWA CPEs to connect back towards the selected serving cell set by the earlier MLC, and prevent unnecessary MLC triggered handovers when the CPEs reenter connected mode. The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.actionAtRelease attribute should be set to CRP\_MLC\_CONDITIONAL for the idle mode steering of FWA users in such MLC configuration.

The attribute TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.mlcPeriodicEnabled should be set to TRUE to enable the periodic Multi-Layer Coordination function which is required to steer FWA CPEs to target frequencies while in connected mode. In the event of cell service interruption on the target FWA bands the periodic re-evaluation of Multi-Layer Coordination will push the FWA users back to the target frequencies once they become available again without the FWA users needing to go into idle mode.

For further information, see the NR Traffic Steering Solution Guideline.

## 2.7 Observability and KPI Handling

Observability covers all functions in NR RAN that supervise the performance and characteristics of the network. This can be done on various levels with different target groups and requirements. On macro level Key Performance Indicators (KPI) represents the end-user perception and are calculated from PI and Performance Management (PM) counters. The PI represents system level information that explains the KPI results. Many PIs can be based on PM counters, for example, PM counters for Root Cause Analysis. Resource Use Indicators (RI) represents information at the system level that explains the system capacity and resource usage. The RI data can be used for planning and dimensioning. Please refer to the Key Performance Indicators User Guide for details.

The RAN Performance Observability model is applicable to FWA as well, covering accessibility, retainability, integrity, mobility, availability and utilization. While the KPIs used to evaluate the performance of FWA are similar to those of MBB networks, the fixed and "always on" characteristics of FWA means that there is much more focus on integrity metrics like throughput.

PM counters can be categorized into node counters and Event Based Statistics (EBS) counters.

Node statistics data can cover basic FWA related measurements. They are produced on the RAN Compute node and stored in counter Result Output Period (ROP) files. The Counters Diagrams User Guide shows examples when in the session sequence counters are stepped.

EBS counters are generated off the node, in the Ericsson Network Manager (ENM). EBS counters are based on events which occur in the node. The events are communicated from the node to ENM, along with instructions on how to generate the EBS counters from the events, and the available event filters, where applicable. The counters are then calculated and stored in ROP files on ENM.

For any counter details, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document.

The figure below provides a structural overview regarding the counter availability per RAN Compute node and ENM. This document focuses on NR related counters for FWA available as EBS counters or flexible counters in ENM and node counters in the gNodeB. Node counters in gNodeB provide only a limited choice of FWA observability. To monitor and optimize the FWA performance the usage of EBS-N counters is recommended. Note the different structure for LTE counters in respect to flexible counters and EBS-L counters which are not handled further in this document.

Figure 27   Available Counter - Principal Overview

pmEbsnXXX counter are related to time aggregated PM events. pmEbsXXX counter are not related to time aggregated PM events.

Two types of flexible EBS-N counters can be created:

- Base Flexible EBS-N counter
    - pmEbsXXX, example: pmEbsDrbEstabSucc5qi
    - pmEbsnXXX, example: pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbQos
- Additional Flexible EBS-N counter
    - pmEbsXXX\_filter, example: pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlPartitionDistr\_PartitionId2
    - pmEbsnXXX\_filter, example: pmEbsnMacVolDlDrb\_snssai2

The filter criteria are appended with underscores to the Base Flexible EBS-N counter name.

See Aggregated PM Events and EBS Counters Enabler feature descriptions.

### 2.7.1 EBS-N Counter and PM Events

The figure below gives a high-level overview how and where EBS-N counter or flexible counter are handled for FWA. The EBS-N application collects PM events from the gNodeBs to generate RAN performance statistics based on EBS-N counter. PM applications are used for the definition and monitoring of KPIs, PIs, RIs based on the EBS-N counters. Ericsson Network IQ Statistics (ENIQ-S) is one example of such a PM application that supports the KPI monitoring. Performance Management Initiation and Collection (PMIC) is an application within ENM and used to create PM event subscriptions in the gNodeBs which are automatically determined based on the selected EBS-N counters. The collection of PM events obtained from the gNodeBs and the creation of EBS-N related PM counters in ENM is done by the EBS-N function which maps the received PM event data to the corresponding EBS-N counters. EBS-N writes the counters into 3GPP compliant PM files. Flexible EBS-N counter can be defined through the Flexible Counter Management (FCM) application in ENM and allows the differentiation of certain base EBS-N counters through filter criteria.

See Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document for the available aggregated PM events and respective counters.

### 2.7.2 FWA Related EBS-N Counter

Throughout this section examples of EBS-N counters, PM events and applicable filter are used.

#### 2.7.2.1 Flexible Filtering Considerations

EBS-N counters can be filtered by applicable filters directly linked to the counter, for example: Qos, QosType, PlmnId, Snssai, UePowerClass, NrDcConfigured, Arp, ServiceId, PartitionId, TrafficSteeringType.

Depending on how FWA is deployed different filters or filter combinations might be used. The list below shows some examples:

| FWA Deployment Case     | Filter Example         |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Dedicated network slice | Snssai                 |
| Dedicated PLMN          | PlmnId                 |
| Dedicated QoS           | QoS                    |
| RRP used                | PartitionId, ServiceId |

Another option is to filter via UE group types PrefUeGrpId, UeGrpId, UeMobilityGrpId, or UeServiceGrpId of the UE Grouping Framework. Applicable UE grouping criteria are for example: QCI or 5QI, ARP, PLMN, SPID or RFSP, S-NSSAI, Masked IMEI-SV, Cell Group Role (see UE Grouping Framework for a complete list). If for example a dedicated SPID is used for FWA in a NR NSA deployment, the SPID can be used as filter as well. Another example is using the Masked IMEI-SV to filter based on a certain CPE type.

As there is a maximum number of EBS-N flexible counters that can be created in ENM, the flexible EBS-N counter definition needs to be carefully balanced between all counters required.

#### 2.7.2.2 Integrity

The throughput-related integrity KPIs can be calculated from the corresponding flexible EBS-N counters as shown below:

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 29   Throughput-Related Integrity KPIs

Complementary formulas that measure the total average MAC throughput in RAN for any traffic profile and condition are given below. These formulas make use of additional EBS-N counters and determine the throughput during a complete measurement period, for example a 15 minute (900 s) Result Output Period (ROP).

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 30   Average DL MAC DRB Throughput - Fixed Time Normalized

To determine the total average MAC layer throughput in uplink direction for each UE and network slice, the following formula can be used:

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 31   Average UL MAC UE Throughput - Fixed Time Normalized

The table below lists integrity base EBS-N counters supporting the flexible filtering relevant for FWA that could be used together with the corresponding PM events obtained from the gNodeB.

| Base EBS-N Counter           | gNodeB PM Event         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| pmEbsnMacVolDlDrb            | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacTimeDlDrb           | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbQos         | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacTimeDlDrbQos        | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbLastSlot    | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbSingleBurst | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolUlResUe          | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacTimeUlResUe         | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolUlUnresUe        | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolUlResUeLate      | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |
| pmEbsnMacVolUlResUeLastSlot  | DuPerUeTrafficRepAggr10 |

The EBS-N counters in the table above monitor the throughput of both the NSA and SA users, in case the NR cell supports both NR deployment types. In case dedicated monitoring per NR NSA and per NR SA is required, filtering the traffic from NSA and SA CPEs can be separated by using the QosType filter to create the corresponding flexible EBS-N counter, for example pmEbsMacVolDlDrb\_qostype1 for NR NSA and for pmEbsMacVolDlDrb\_qostype2 NR SA.

In case of NR carrier aggregation, the counters include the volume across all carriers used for the DRB.

MBB and FWA Throughput Distribution Counter:

The following NR downlink and uplink throughput distribution EBS counters are available:

- pmEbsnMacDrbThpDlMbbHighVolDistr
- pmEbsnMacDrbThpDlMbbLowVolDistr
- pmEbsnMacUeThpUlMbbHighVolDistr
- pmEbsnMacUeThpUlMbbLowVolDistr

Counter Usage can be tuned excluding certain items depending on whether during a measurement session voice, small packages, large packages, a small session time, etc. are used during an interval:

- pmEbsnDrbExclThpDlRelativeHighVol
- pmEbsnDrbExclThpDlRelativeLowVol
- pmEbsnDrbExclThpDlShortTimeHighVol
- pmEbsnDrbExclThpDlShortTimeLowVol
- pmEbsnDrbExclThpDlSmallVol
- pmEbsnUeExclThpUlRelativeHighVol
- pmEbsnUeExclThpUlRelativeLowVol
- pmEbsnUeExclThpUlShortTimeHighVol
- pmEbsnUeExclThpUlShortTimeLowVol
- pmEbsnUeExclThpUlSmallVol
- pmEbsnUeExclThpVoNR

Note that these counters are available on cell level and are not filterable. However, as the results of these counters report throughput which aligns with performance reported by internet-based speed test servers, these distribution counters might still provide useful information, despite the reporting is on NR cell level for both MBB and FWA usage.

#### 2.7.2.3 Utilization

In NR SA, unique counters are introduced to allow filtering the average and max number of connected users per service. The following counters provide the average number of users in RRC connected mode per S-NSSAI and the peak number of users in RRC connected mode per S-NSSAI over the measurement period respectively.

- pmEbsRrcConnLevelSnssaiSum
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelSnssaiMax

In NR NSA the connected user counters are not filterable. However, non-filterable counters may still provide useful information regarding the resource usage per cell for both MBB &amp; FWA together, for example as input to dimensioning. The following counters show the total average and peak number of EN-DC connected users in an NR cell, regardless of service type.

- pmRrcConnLevelSumEnDc
- pmRrcConnLevelMaxEnDc

The counters below show the resource utilization over time per cell.

- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilDlMax
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlDistr
- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlMax

Cell utilization counters are not filterable and do not allow to determine how many resources are being used by FWA or MBB at any given time. However, partition counters show utilization for all downlink Resource Blocks assigned to a given partition. For example, a FWA partition counter will show the utilization of all downlink Resource Blocks with the FWA slice identifier (SPID, N-SSAI). Slice partitions are recommended to be dimensioned based on usage and throughput of the cell for each user group. These usage and dimensioning can be based on measurement or estimation.

#### 2.7.2.4 Radio Resource Partitioning Related Counter

Utilization of the configured and system internal partitions (priority, residual) can be monitored. For the configured partitions the PartitionId and ServiceId can be used as filter to identify the FWA partition. Which PartitionId and ServiceId is used for FWA is part of the gNodeB MO settings. The partition utilization is reported as number of used resource block symbols for a normal partition averaged over one second. Note that the partition utilization can show higher values than the resource shares that are specified by the resource allocation policies. This can happen in situations in which one partition is under-utilized while the other partition is over-utilized. The utilization is expressed as percentage of the total available resource blocks used by all downlink resource blocks (RBs) corresponding to the user (for example FWA) of the partition. The residual partition only contains the utilization of downlink RBs that are not mapped to any configured partition. This can show the residual partition as 0% if all active downlink RBs are corresponding to configured partitions.

When introducing RRP in a cell that already contains FWA traffic, a first step can be to partition in such a way that almost all traffic, from both FWA and MBB users, goes through the residual partition. This has no impact on QoS or performance as the standard QoS enforcement is still be followed in the residual partition. However, this allows the monitoring of the cell utilization for each individual user group by separately fetching the FWA partition counters and the MBB partition counters while most of the traffic remains in the residual partition. This can serve as a baseline for how the utilization of resources is distributed in a cell before fully implementing partitioning by assigning proper dimensioned partition shares, as illustrated in figure below.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 32   RRP Introduction

Note this can potentially be used by operators with no intention to fully implement RRP but looking for observability.

| Base EBS-N Counter                        | Applicable Filters     | gNodeB PM Event               |

#### 2.7.2.7 Mobility

Despite that FWA CPEs are stationary, mobile performance indicators can be utilized to check if any network optimizations would be needed, for example if CPEs are attempting intra or inter gNodeB handover. Handover performance indicators are typically filterable per S-NSSAI, QoS or UE Group so that FWA users can be clearly identified.

#### 2.7.2.8 Availability

In general, the performance indicators of the cell availability can be observed as follows:

| Base EBS-N Counter    | Applicable Filter Examples   | gNodeB PM Event       |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| pmEbsCellDowntimeAuto | no filter                    | DuPerNRCellDUDowntime |
| pmEbsCellDowntimeMan  | no filter                    | DuPerNRCellDUDowntime |

Note that these counters are on cell level and not filterable.

### 2.7.3 FWA Related Node Counter

This section describes which node counters can be utilized for FWA observability. Compared to the recommended EBS-N counters, only a subset of FWA performance indicators is available based on node counters. For all available node counters, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document.

A downlink throughput Integrity KPI can be calculated from the corresponding node counters as shown below:

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 33   DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS

The KPI shows for each QoS class, such as 5QI or QCI, the DRB downlink throughput for data bursts restricted by the air interface. To filter on FWA it is assumed that FWA services have at least one dedicated QoS value. In case a KPI per FWA service is wanted, dedicated QoS settings per FWA service are required. This KPI is independent of using network slicing or a dedicated PLMN.

See the Key Performance Indicators User Guide for details.

There are additional QoS (QCI or 5QI) based integrity performance indicators available which could be used to observe FWA performance. Below counters are related to downlink, uplink volume and downlink throughput. For a complete list of available node counters along with counter descriptions, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document.

Downlink/Uplink Volume:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbLastSlotQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQos

Downlink Throughput:

- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbLastSlotSampQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbSampQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbQos
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbLastSlotQos

For the ENDC leg in NR NSA deployments, a FWA QCI could be used for selecting UE sessions for throughput calculation. UE sessions where the FWA QCI matches the attribute dominQciFilter are included in the calculation of FWA QCI-based throughput filtering in uplink and downlink.

The following EUtranCellTDD counters are related (EUtranCellFDD are similar):

- EUtranCellTDD.pmMacUeThpUlMbbLowVolQciDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmMacUeThpUlMbbHighVolQciDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeExclThpUlRelativeQciLowVol
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeExclThpUlRelativeQciHighVol
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeExclThpUlShortTimeQciLowVol
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeExclThpUlShortTimeQciHighVol
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpDlMbbFilteredQciDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeExclThpDlQciShortDrb

### 2.7.4 Radio Link Quality Observability

Radio Link parameters like SINR, CQI, Rank Indicator and MCS can be observed in RAN on cell level, for MBB and FWA users together. The following list shows examples:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioSinrPuschDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi256QamRank1Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi256QamRank2Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi256QamRank3Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi256QamRank4Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi64QamRank1Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi64QamRank2Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi64QamRank3Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepCqi64QamRank4Distr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioUeRepRankDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschTable1McsDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschTable2McsDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable2McsDistr

Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) counters are filterable per UE Group, QoS Type, NSSAI or SPID. Those counters can be used to provide some indication regarding FWA traffic in poor coverage: when pmEbsnMacUeHarqDlAckQpsk counters are pegged, it is assumed at least one FWA CPE uses QPSK modulation which should only be used at cell edge. This counter could be used as an indication further investigation is needed, trying to identify users under poor coverage, for example using performance management and diagnostic reports from the Auto Configuration Server (ACS) or performance events from a NR UE trace. The following lists HARQ counters:

- NRCellDU.pmEbsnMacUeHarqDlAckQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmEbsnMacUeHarqUlAckQpsk

Furthermore, for High-Band deployments cell edge observability counters are available providing channel condition (SINR) based observability into cell coverage during initial access and connected mode. These counters are targeted to be used when comparing their status with a monitored High-Band feature disabled and then enabled. However, these counter could give as well an indication about the users in bad channel conditions. For a deployment as outlined in the section  High-Band FWA Use Case it can be assumed that low SINR users will mainly be FWA users.

- pmRadioPreambleSinr...Distr
- pmRadioSinrPusch...Distr

For a complete list of available counters along with counter descriptions, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document.

### 2.7.5 CPE Observability

CPE devices can be managed remotely from an Auto Configuration Server (ACS) including support functions for performance management and diagnostics. CPEs use management protocols like the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) or Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA-DM). Both protocols provide fault and performance management functions to improve CPE operation efficiency and to trouble-shoot networking problems. The CWMP is based on TR-069, TR-181, TR-098, TR-143.

Performance monitoring of the CPE radio interface relies in most cases on CPE vendor specific extensions to report performance indicators like the average uplink and downlink bandwidth sampled within a certain time interval, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, and MCS among others. The ACS can propagate the collected radio link performance indicators to the OSS or BSS and be used to trigger alarms based on predefined threshold values identifying CPE devices with a poor radio signal. The principal setup is shown in the figure below.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 34   CPE Observability

TR-143 provides an end-to-end performance test suite. The CPE performance can be validated in terms of delay, delay variation, throughput and packet loss in uplink and downlink directions on specified end-to-end paths.

To execute these measurements, the CPE interacts with one or more Network Test Servers placed at a strategic location in the network. The ACS can remotely trigger the TR-143 tests to be executed by the CPE or the Network Test Server. Those performance tests can be executed after initial CPE installation to establish a baseline, then for troubleshooting purpose or for continuous monitoring.

## 2.8 Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)

### 2.8.1 Device Types

Two types of CPE devices can be used with FWA to connect residential customers to the 3GPP mobile network.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 35   CPE Device Types

- Outdoor CPE - Two-device solution The outdoor device contains the 4G/5G modem and antenna to connect with the 3GPP mobile network, as well as a Gigabit Ethernet (GE) port providing LAN connectivity to the indoor RGW and power through PoE.
- Indoor CPE - One-device solution The indoor device combines RGW and 4G/5G access functions in a single box. The device has inbuilt 4G/5G modem and antennas.

Compared to Indoor CPEs (without external antennas), Outdoor CPEs provide much better performance in terms of spectral efficiency or throughput, assuming the antenna can be installed in an optimal position in direct line of sight to the RBS. On the other hand, Indoor CPEs are generally easier to install.

The use of Outdoor CPEs is recommended for FWA deployments.

Besides the 4G/5G antenna installation, it is also important to consider the 3GPP device categories (also known as UE categories), MIMO, carrier aggregation and modulation capabilities supported by the CPE.

### 2.8.2 Connectivity

#### 2.8.2.1 CPE Forwarding Modes

CPE devices typically provide a range of IP packet forwarding modes influencing the WAN and LAN connectivity setup:

- Bridge Mode is mainly used with Outdoor CPEs. The Outdoor Unit (ODU) passes its assigned IP address to a connected IDU (that is RGW) so that both devices share the same IP address. The ODU might or might not intercept all management traffic destined to the shared IP address. The possibility to manage the ODU and IDU when using Bridge Mode depends on device specific feature implementations, for example the ODU might be able to snoop the management traffic from the IDU to select a different source port with the shared IP address. In Bridge Mode, the IDU provides DHCP and NAPT services to the connected LAN devices. Note: Certain IP services (for example DHCP or DNS to resolve the ACS URL) might not work on the bridging device (ODU)
- Router Mode can be used with Indoor or Outdoor CPEs. If Router Mode is used with Indoor CPEs, the CPE works as a router to the connected LAN devices and provides Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) services. If used with Outdoor CPEs, both the ODU and IDU can provide DHCP and NAPT services to the respective LAN devices, resulting in a sub-optimal double NAPT solution. The NAPT service on the ODU can for example be removed by configuring Routing behind MS in EPC/5GC, but this requires extra configuration effort and is subject to certain feature limitations.
- NAT Mode is mainly used with Indoor CPEs. The CPE provides DHCP and NAPT services like the Router Mode.

It is important to configure the CPE mode properly so that the LAN devices are assigned valid IP addresses and can send/receive traffic with guaranteed QoS.

NAT or Router mode is recommended with Indoor CPE deployments.

Bridge mode is recommended with Outdoor CPE deployments, unless vendor specific implementations require a different mode (e.g. NAT) to manage the outdoor and indoor units (as individual entities or a single, combined entity).

Note: The forwarding mode might also influence the number of EPC APNs and 5GC DNNs that can be configured on the CPE. This is a vendor specific feature dependency.

#### 2.8.2.2 IP Address Assignment

IP address assignment for FWA CPEs follows the same principles as for normal mobile UEs: The EPC/5GC is responsible for allocating and assigning the IPv4 address, IPv6 prefix or both to the CPE when it attaches to the mobile network and requests a PDN connection for a certain APN or DNN.

## 2.9 Business-to-Business Customer Considerations

In addition to residential FWA customers, FWA may also be offered to businesses and premium users, with small to medium enterprises particularly well-suited for FWA. These customers typically have specific requirements on reliability, availability and performance leading to higher and stricter Service Level Agreements (SLAs). These SLA-based customers require additional protection from other traffic in the network and increased observability to ensure fulfillment of SLAs.

To support these SLAs one network slice (S-NSSAI) per SLA-based customer could be used. A S-NSSAI is made up of a slice service type (SST) and a slice differentiator (SD). A SST can be assigned to all premium FWA customers, and they can be further differentiated by a unique SD. Since all cells and gNodeBs in the same tracking area must support the same set of network slices (NSSAIs), it is also important to distinguish local SLA-based FWA users only active in one tracking area, a single small business office for example, from regional SLA-based FWA users such as a retail chain active in multiple tracking areas. As there is a maximum number of slices supported per baseband, it is recommended that only the slices active in the tracking area should be configured.

Figure 36   Business-to-Business Network Slicing Example

To ensure good performance and SLA fulfillment, professional installation of outdoor CPE devices is recommended for SLA-based customers. Geo-locking is also recommended to be configured for these users to ensure they are only active in their dimensioned sectors and do not swap CPEs between multiple sites.

With a unique S-NSSAI each SLA-based customer can be configured with a partition using Radio Resource Partitioning. The partition share can be calculated to ensure that SLAs will be fulfilled for each customer, typically based on throughput requirements.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 37   Example: Business-to-Business Customer Per Slice in Mid-Band

The above figure shows an example deployment in Mid-Band.

Different service types are assumed for SLA-based customers. These different service types are placed in different partitions to support SLA fulfillment per service type when there is a shortage of the shared radio resources in the NR cell. Each of these services can be assigned a 5QI shared amongst all network slices. A dedicated 5QI table can be used for further tuning of resources within the SLA-based partition based on customer requirements. As described in the  QoS section, priority-controlled scheduling could be used to differentiate traffic flows on bearer level based on the associated priority levels. Relative priority scheduling could be used to utilize the relative priority, when calculating the scheduling probability of a Data Radio Bearer (DRB).

A common UE group is used for SLA-based and residential customers assuming the same FWA settings apply for example for DRX and FWA traffic steering.

Observability for SLA-based customers can be setup per S-NSSAI which means that the observability can be done per customer for all counters that can be filtered on S-NSSAI. Service-level observability is possible by a filter combination of S-NSSAI and 5QI.

## 2.10 Value-Added Services

FWA subscribers acquire the Value-Added Services (VAS) usually on top of their connectivity subscription. The VAS is typically provided with better quality of experience than similar Over-The-Top (OTT) services. The sections below elaborate on two example VASs, voice and IPTV.

### 2.10.1 Voice

A FWA voice service can be deployed by using for example VoNR, VoLTE or VoIP. While VoNR and VoLTE are 3GPP standardized services, VoIP refers in general to converting standard voice telephony signals into a digital signal, packetizing that signal, and transmitting it over an IP network. To guarantee the speech quality all voice deployment options require service level guarantees in terms of QoS. While VoNR is available for NR SA and FR1 only, VoLTE can be used in a NR NSA deployment. The figure below shows an example setup for VoNR. Both MBB and FWA users can use VoNR as prioritized traffic using 5QI 1 and 5 outside the respective MBB and FWA resource partitions. For details, see the 5G Voice SA RAN Solution Guideline.

Figure 38   VoNR Example Setup for FWA

### 2.10.2 IPTV

The IPTV VAS service in the context of this document is defined as the secure and reliable delivery of TV entertainment associated to a particular 5QI. It is classified by a minimum guaranteed throughput to provide an uninterrupted level of TV service at any network performance level, which means even during resource contention.

The 'Wireless Fiber' FWA business segment may include a full IPTV offering, implying much higher data consumption compared to other FWA services.

A minimum Service Level Agreement (SLA) for IPTV can be guaranteed by

- an appropriate capacity &amp; dimensioning planning (see section Planning and Deployment)
- a suitable QoS handling.

The QoS settings for the IPTV service can be either

- static or
- dynamic.

A static priority can be configured using either priority-controlled scheduling or relative priority scheduling. To avoid potential service degradation of other users it is recommended to configure rate throttling in the core network. A fixed priority could be set for both FR1 and FR2 bands.

A dynamic priority handling can be configured using rate-controlled scheduling. In such case IPTV would be prioritized over other services if the IPTV throughput is below a configured rate threshold. If the throughput is above a configured rate threshold, a fallback to the cell default priority will happen. To avoid performance degradation for other services during contention, it is recommended to use radio resource partitioning. Note that rate-controlled scheduling is currently only available for FR1 bands.

The capacity and dimensioning planning needs to consider IPTV users explicitly in the Rmin calculation. Typical parameters influencing the minimum required data rate for IPTV are:

- Usage of Standard Definition, High Definition, or Ultra-High Definition
- Used encoders like MPEG-2 or MPEG-4
- Number of parallel IPTV channels per FWA subscriber

Depending on the quality of the IPTV stream above 5 to 45 Mbps per IPTV user may need to be considered for the Rmin calculations. Additionally, the IPTV service typically consumes a significantly higher amount of data compared to other services influencing for example the required capacity per site.

Capacity and Dimensioning Considerations

## 2.11 Energy Efficiency

Energy consumption is an increasing concern for many operators, and several features are available to help the reduce energy use of network equipment. These features can help reduce the energy cost for both MBB and FWA by reducing capability when network demand is low, such as during the off-peak hours. However, the impact of these features should be considered for FWA users, especially when co-located with MBB.

When considering FWA traffic profiles it should be noted that even a small number of FWA users may greatly increase traffic demand. Many operators provide a minimum service level for FWA users, with an expectation that the user will not receive less than the dimensioned Rmin for more than a short time. These users may also not always follow typical traffic patterns of off-peak and busy hour from what is expected of MBB users.

### 2.11.1 Booster Carrier Sleep

The feature Booster Carrier Sleep allows a cell with low PRB usage to be put to sleep. During the configured window for energy saving, typically during off-peak hours, the PRB usage will be continually monitored and when it is lower than the configured threshold for the duration of the set monitoring period the cell will be put to sleep. Any UEs still on the cell will be offloaded to other cells when entering sleep mode. When all cells on a radio unit are in sleep mode the radio may also be put into deep sleep for maximum energy savings.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 39   Booster Carrier Sleep Functionality Example

Caution is advised if configuring sleep mode for cells with FWA users, as this feature can have a significant impact on FWA performance and end-user experience. Typical FWA deployments will steer FWA users to the capacity bands, which are usually the candidates for sleep mode with Booster Carrier Sleep. If Booster Carrier Sleep is configured on these cells, then any active FWA users will be offloaded from the target cell and enough capacity will be required on the new cells to ensure good FWA performance while the capacity cells are in sleep mode. For example, the dimensioned Rmin for all FWA users should still be achievable on the coverage cells until the capacity cells exit sleep mode.

Although the average PRB usage is measured before entering sleep mode to ensure the demand is low, the demand may change over the sleep period. For example, multiple FWA users may become active while the cells are in sleep mode and increase demand significantly. The sleep timers should be configured to account for these possible changes in traffic to have high confidence that FWA performance will not degrade significantly until the sleep period ends. However, configuring shorter timers will result in less energy savings.

Although Radio Deep Sleep can be used to maximize energy savings by putting the radio into deep sleep mode, the wakeup time for Radio Deep Sleep is much longer than carrier sleep mode. Carrier sleep can recover within seconds, but radio deep sleep will require a radio restart to recover, which can take several minutes depending on the radio hardware. This extra recovery time should be accounted for when configuring the sleep timers and whether to allow radio deep sleep for FWA cells, as traffic conditions can change considerably over such a long period of time.

Some deployments will prohibit FWA CPEs from using other bands other than the capacity bands. For these deployments Booster Carrier Sleep should not be configured on these cells, as this will cause connectivity loss for the FWA service.

For further details see NR Booster Carrier Sleep.

### 2.11.2 NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

The NR Massive MIMO Sleep feature allows the deactivation of Tx antenna branches in NR massive MIMO mid-band radios when traffic demand is low. When enabled, the PRB utilization and connected users are monitored and averaged, and these averages are compared against the configured activation thresholds. When both criteria are below the threshold then a timer is started, and if the average load stays below the thresholds for the duration of the timer the radio enters massive MIMO sleep and mutes some of the Tx branches on the radio. Similarly, to come out of sleep the average PRB utilization and connected users continue to be monitored while in sleep mode and when these values exceed the configured deactivation thresholds a timer is started. If the load stays above the threshold for the duration of the timer the Tx antennas become active again.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 40   NR Massive MIMO Sleep Example

The PRB utilization and connected users are aggregated for all traffic, so when deployed with MBB a mix of MBB and FWA users should be assumed. Muting the Tx antenna branches will result in lower massive MIMO performance, with less gains from beamforming and lower power. This will have a negative impact on throughput and spectral efficiency while active.

When configuring in cells with FWA traffic the thresholds and timers should be carefully chosen to ensure that end-user experience is not greatly diminished and dimensioned Rmin can be maintained. For example, the wake-up thresholds and wake-up timer should be configured so that if FWA user demand quickly increases the Tx antennas will reactivate without the end-user experiencing a significant impact on performance. To protect FWA KPIs the wake-up timer may be set more conservatively than an MBB-only network to be more responsive to these changes in traffic.

For more information see NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode.

### 2.11.3 Automated Energy Saver

The Automated Energy Saver feature automates the configuration and management of the NR Massive MIMO Sleep feature. Rather than setting a threshold based on PRB utilization and connected users manually, Automated Energy Saver allows the configuration of a target intent and will adjust the PRB utilization thresholds automatically to achieve a certain level of end-user performance. This intent can be defined as the configured throughput that should be achieved by a configured percentage of users in the cell, for example, 90% of users should achieve a minimum of 30Mpbs. The feature will override the parameters used in NR Massive MIMO Sleep and update the thresholds automatically to achieve the wanted performance.

This feature simplifies the configuration of these thresholds and provides a responsiveness to changes in user experience. This can be especially useful for cells with FWA service since there is an expectation of a certain level of service guarantee in most cases. However, the target throughput and ratio of users that should achieve this throughput is not service-aware, so for cells with MBB and FWA it should be assumed that there is a mix of traffic.

To ensure that a minimum level of service is maintained for FWA users it is recommended to configure the target throughput a certain level higher than the dimensioned Rmin, and that variations in user experience due to users in radio conditions are considered when choosing the percent of users that should achieve the intended throughput. The user experience is evaluated in 15 minute periods and the thresholds updated accordingly, so traffic may vary from expected if there is a surge in traffic.

Note that the Automated Energy Saver does not change the monitor timers configured in NR Massive MIMO sleep. Although the throughput is evaluated every 15 minutes and the PRB thresholds are updated accordingly, the actual time to wake from sleep mode is still configured by these monitor timers. For a more responsive wake-up a shorter timer may still be used when Automated Energy Saver is configured.

For more information see Automated Energy Saver.

## 2.12 High Load Handling

High load issues can occur in cells with a very large number of users connected. Although QoS and slicing features can help provide priority for FWA in the user plane, if many UEs are connected on the cell there may be other issues in accessibility and control plane resources which will impact the end-user experience for FWA users, such as PDCCH blocking decreasing the cell capacity. Since FWA users are typically fewer in number and more stable, these types of issues are usually caused by swells in the number of MBB users, which can impact the FWA service.

Several features are available to configure how the system behaves in high load scenarios, and many can be used to provide prioritization for different services. For example, NR Service Admission Control can be used to limit the number of PDU sessions from lower priority services such as MBB to protect higher priority services like FWA. Adaptive SRB Priority can also be used to provide priority for FWA SRBs and protect against MBB signaling storms.

For a comprehensive overview of available features and example configurations please refer to the High Load Handling Solution Guideline.

# 4 Example Network Designs

## 4.1 Mid-Band NR SA FWA Use Case

This FWA use case covers a NR SA deployment example where MBB and FWA services are deployed within a single PLMN. A NR TDD Mid-Band is used as capacity layer. The figure below shows the available frequency bands.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 41   FWA Use Case Example: TDD Mid-Band and NR FDD Low-Band Carrier Aggregation Usage

In area 0 the capacity NR TDD layer has full coverage for FWA and MBB subscribers. The NR TDD layer is used as PCell and can be combined via carrier aggregation with the NR FDD layer. Since the preferred frequency for FWA users is the NR TDD band, the NR FDD band is only used as PCell in case of issues on NR TDD coverage, for example:

- bad placement of CPE,
- increased interference,
- obstructions.

FWA CPEs do not get priority on the NR FDD band and camp only on NR FDD temporarily. It is recommended to trigger troubleshooting if a FWA CPE is connected longer or permanently on NR FDD.

In area 1 the FDD Low-Band provides a better coverage than NR TDD and is therefore used as PCell.

Different FWA subscriptions are sold based on maximum allowed data rate similar to fixed broadband commercial offerings. These subscriptions are enforced by rate throttling in the core. Each subscription type can be optionally bundled with a set-top box live TV service.

A commercial usage policy is also enforced to prevent abuse of the FWA service. Consumption will be monitored for each subscription and the throttled rate will be lowered if the monthly consumption exceeds the monthly allowance.

Service guarantees in terms of resource utilization, availability, and throughput are provided for Internet and Live/Streaming TV FWA services. Therefore, FWA services are tuned according to QoS requirements with rate-controlled scheduling.

Deployment Mid-Band

### 4.1.1 Pre-Qualification Mid-Band

For this example, consider a scenario where FWA is being introduced to the network, so the current subscriber penetration is zero. It is also calculated that the addressable household density in the network is high, and that the operator would like to minimize the cost per household during the initial rollout. With these parameters the operator might decide to focus on indoor CPEs only with pre-qualification to reject households with a poor signal level. The operator can analyze drive-test data and simulation data and reject all households with worse than an expected -90 dBm RSSI. They can then provision indoor CPEs for all qualified subscribers for low-cost self-installation.

Figure 42   FWA Use Case 1 Initial Rollout

The operator can also prepare for growth opportunities as more subscribers are added to the network. If the demand in the market is such that the operator would like to address even more households after the initial rollout, they can adjust their approach to provision indoor CPEs only to households with very good radio conditions (above -80 dBm RSSI) and provision outdoor CPEs to households between -80 and -110 dBm RSSI, while continuing to reject users with very poor radio link below -110 dBm RSSI. This would allow the operator to address far more households in the network without needing to densify or add new spectrum. Additionally, they can migrate the poorest performing users with indoor CPEs from step 1 to outdoor CPEs to further improve performance.

### 4.1.2 Deployment Mid-Band

MBB and FWA are separated into different E2E network slices. FWA Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and MBB UEs need to be NR SA capable and always register with the 5GC network over the NR cell providing coverage and Option 2 connectivity.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 44   FWA Use Case 1 Network Slicing Setup

The figure below shows an example where NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling is used for FWA traffic and RRP is used for MBB to protect MBB traffic under contention. Rate-Controlled Scheduling is configured for soft-rate throttling mode for the internet service and prioritized rate mode for the IPTV service. MBB users with a data service use partition 1. MBB VoNR is handled as prioritized traffic for both 5QI=1 and 5QI=5. A relative priority of 8 is configured for FWA internet to prioritize the service in the same priority domain as MBB up to the configured rate. After the configured rate is achieved the FWA Internet service will be assigned to a lower priority domain. The IPTV service will be assigned a higher priority domain until the configured rate is met, where it will then be assigned to the same priority domain as MBB. This will ensure an uninterrupted service quality for the TV service. The IPTV uplink traffic is typically small and therefore kept in the default priority domain. A different DRX parameter setting for MBB and FWA per used 5QI is shown in the figure as well.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 45   FWA Use Case 1 Parameter Example

In the Cloud Core Policy Controller, a session-AMBR is defined to enforce the maximum bitrate allowed according to the sold service tier of the user. The table below shows an example configuration for how these can be defined with different service tiers. A commercial usage policy of 3 TB/month is also enforced through consumption monitoring in the PCF. Once the monthly consumption for a user exceeds 3TB it is deemed an abuse of service and the PCF will trigger an update of the session-AMBR to provide a penalized rate. A reset period is defined to revert to the default session-AMBR at the beginning of each month.

| Subscription   | Maximum Data Rate   | Commercial Usage Policy   | Penalized Data Rate   |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Internet 25    | 25 Mbps             | 3 TB/month                | 2 Mbps                |
| Internet 50    | 50 Mbps             | 3 TB/month                | 2 Mbps                |
| Internet 100   | 100 Mbps            | 3 TB/month                | 2 Mbps                |
| Internet 200   | 200 Mbps            | 3 TB/month                | 2 Mbps                |
| IPTV           | Unlimited           | Unlimited                 | Unlimited             |

All internet service tiers will use the same 5QI and QoS configuration. This means that only the maximum rate will be affected by the service tier, and all users will get the same priority during resource contention. A QoS modification request could also be triggered for users that exceed their usage policy, but this would require a new QoS to be defined for these users in the gNodeB.

#### 4.1.2.1 Dimensioning and Partition Share Settings
        Mid-Band

The dimensioning activity can first identify the minimum spectrum required for MBB subscribers in the sector. MBB KPIs can be collected to see how many radio resources are needed to achieve acceptable KPIs and account for growth. Any spare resources can be used by FWA.

Once the amount of resources needed by MBB is determined, this can be used as the reference for the partition share required for MBB. This will protect the MBB service from any surges in FWA traffic or over-dimensioning the FWA service.

For example, in this use case MBB usage statistics and KPIs are analyzed, and it is determined that 40% of the Mid-Band TDD spectrum is required to meet this demand as well as a 5-year growth in MBB traffic. FWA users can then be onboarded so long as the configured rate can be met in the unallocated traffic under contention with MBB.

Once the maximum number of dimensioned FWA users are added to the network, no more FWA subscriptions can be sold until more capacity is added. This can be done by migrating the worst performing users with indoor CPEs to outdoor CPEs to improve efficiency, or by adding new radio capacity to the network.

### 4.1.3 Configuration Examples

This section provides some configuration examples for Use Case 1. The figure below shows an example parameter configuration for DRX that differs for MBB and FWA.

Figure 46   FWA Use Case 1 UE Grouping Configuration Example

In this example a UE Group for FWA is defined with a selection criterion based on S-NSSAI. For this UE Group DRX has been disabled.

The figure below shows the radio resource partitioning settings. The MBB partition is allocated 40% partition size. FWA traffic is configured with a 0% partition size in order to get the utilization counter information. The residual partition size is implicitly defined and therefore not shown in the configuration.

Figure 47   RRP Step 1 Configuration Example

The figure below shows the RRP related counters. The FWA partition 2 resource utilization can be monitored based on partitionId=2 as filter.

![Image](../images/373_22112-IPM10141_100Uen.L/additional_3_CP.png)

Figure 48   RRP Observability Counter Example Setting

The figure below shows an example configuration for the FWA and MBB QoS. In this use case the FWA internet service utilizing 5QI=9 uses the soft-rate throttling mode of rate-controlled scheduling, as well as a higher relative priority over MBB. This allows prioritization of FWA in priority domain 48 until the service achieves the configured rate, at which point it is given a lower priority domain of 56. The IPTV service utilizing 5QI=6 uses prioritized rate mode of rate-controlled scheduling for the downlink traffic. The uplink traffic for IPTV is typically small and is therefore proposed for normal scheduling.

The DU5qi.priorityLevel attribute specifies the relationship between the 5QI and the priority level. The DU5qi.schedulingProfileRef attribute points to the respective scheduling profile which specifies which rate-controlled scheduling mode is used for the associated 5Qi. This is done by setting the schedulingAlgorithm attribute to PRIORITIZED\_RATE or SOFT\_RATE\_THROTTLING. The DlRateBasedPriority MO outlines further detailed settings like dlPrioritizedRate which specifies the threshold rate up to which the Internet and IPTV service is prioritized. Beyond this rate the attribute dldemotedPriority=High will be used, which maps to specific priority domains depending on whether prioritized rate or soft rate throttling is used. A dedicated PDU session is assumed for the FWA IPTV service.

#### 4.1.3.1 Mid-Band Traffic Steering Aspects

This section elaborates on the traffic steering aspects for the outlined FWA use case. For background information, please refer to section  Traffic Management.

In this example we have a separate user group defined for FWA users which is used to configure a unique traffic management profile for FWA users as part of Subscriber- and Service-Triggered Mobility. This user group is referenced by the MO profiles for NR Mobility and NR Traffic Steering.

As part of NR Traffic Steering, Multi-Layer Coordination (MLC) is used for steering the FWA traffic to the NR TDD capacity layer. Since the parameter TrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.pCellAllowed is set to FALSE for the Low-Band NRFreqRelation, this band is not considered for Multi-Layer Coordination PCell optimization, and the Mid-Band is always chosen as the PCell for FWA.

The MLC procedure performs handover to the Mid-Band if a CPE connects to the Low-Band, if the Mid-Band has sufficient coverage. The Bandwidth Triggered Inter-System Handover feature is disabled for FWA as this use case example assumes that LTE is not considered to be used for FWA service. Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is configured to perform handover to the Low-Band in case of very poor coverage on the capacity band. The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage search zone is configured uniquely for FWA users so that handover occurs only at a very low RSRP, allowing FWA users to remain connected to the Mid-Band even in poor coverage. Furthermore, Mobility Control at Poor Coverage settings are taking the MBB UE and FWA CPE power class into account by different A5 offset settings. By this, the coverage area for high power UEs and CPEs is enlarged. This configuration is meant to prevent degradation of Low-Band performance for MBB at the expense of FWA performance in poor coverage on the capacity band. However, pre-qualification prevents users from being in poor coverage, and users in poor coverage are identified to trigger further investigation.

The traffic steering configuration remains the same even if more cells are added in the Low-Band or Mid-Band.

An example parameter configuration is shown in the figure below. The Low-Band gNodeB (gNodeB 1) has NR traffic steering configured to steer users to the Mid-Band as part of Multi-Layer Coordination. Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is not configured for FWA on this node as there is no other band available for FWA if in poor coverage since the Mid-Band is assumed to have lower coverage than the Low-Band. The capacity band gNodeB (gNodeB 2) is configured with a unique FWA profile for both NR Traffic Steering and Mobility Control at Poor Coverage. Not shown is the intra-frequency mobility configuration, which remains common between MBB and FWA. Intra-frequency mobility for FWA occurs only in case of issues on the serving cell.

## 4.2 High-Band FWA Use Case

This FWA use case covers a NR NSA and NR SA deployment example where MBB and FWA services are deployed within a single PLMN. This section focuses on the NR NSA deployment part for any NR NSA specific items while listing common NR NSA and NR SA items as well.

A NR High-Band is used as primary capacity layer. The Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature is activated to enlarge the cell range for high power FWA CPEs. NR TDD Mid-Band is used as secondary capacity layer in case a CPE cannot connect to High-Band, for example because of non line-of-sight. The figure below shows the available frequency bands.

Figure 51   FWA Use Case Example: High-Band and TDD Mid-Band

In area 0 the capacity NR High-Band layer has full coverage for FWA and MBB subscribers. In case of:

- NR SA, the Mid-Band is used as PCell and can be combined using NR-DC with the High-Band.
- NR NSA, a LTE-Band is used as PCell and can be combined using EN-DC with the High-Band.

If the FWA CPE is in non line-of-sight for the High-Band only the Mid-Band is used.

In area 1 only high power FR2 FWA CPEs will have access to the High-Band.

Service guarantees in terms of resource utilization, availability, and throughput are provided for Internet and Live/Streaming TV FWA services. Therefore, FWA services are deployed in a dedicated network slice.

Radio Resource Partitioning is only used in the Mid-Band to ensure fairness in radio resource usage for MBB and FWA as the feature is not yet supported for High-Band.

For NR NSA LTE is used only for the signaling part and data traffic is kept in NR. Therefore RRP is not configured in LTE. The figure below visualizes the NR NSA use case part.

Figure 52   NR NSA Example High-Band

### 4.2.1 Deployment High-Band

For NR NSA deployments the SPID is used for slice differentiation between MBB and FWA. In NR NSA the QCI values for the different services are set similarly as the 5QI value in NR SA. The gNodeB maps the received QCI value 1:1 to the corresponding 5QI value. In this use case dedicated QCI and 5QI values are used for FWA to allow special treatment for FWA users like disabling EN-DC and NR-DC downlink carrier aggregation. Radio Resource Partitioning is only used for the Mid-Band. Priority Controlled Scheduling and Relative Priority Scheduling are used for both Mid- and High-Band.

### 4.2.2 Configuration Examples High-Band

The figure below shows a NR NSA example where RRP is used in Mid-Band for the FWA deployment to distribute the available, shared NR cell resources across the network slices, and services used by MBB and FWA users. A different DRX parameter setting for MBB and FWA per 5QI is used. The UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria indicates a selection criteria for both NSSAI (NR SA) and SPID (NR NSA).

Figure 54   NR NSA FWA High-Band Use Case UE Grouping Example

#### 4.2.2.1 Secondary Node Terminated Split Bearer

Uplink / Downlink Decoupling is enabled so that uplink and downlink user data can be sent independently over

- LTE and High-Band in case of EN-DC or
- Low/Mid-Band and High-Band in case of NR-DC.

In this use case the NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature is utilized to provide a differentiated EN-DC and NR-DC configuration for FWA. This is done following the UE Grouping Framework as shown in the previous section. However, many of the same functions and parameters are shared between NR-DC and EN-DC. If both NSA and SA CPEs are introduced in the network separate FWA UE groups should be created according to the 5G architecture if separate NR-DC and EN-DC configurations are required. For example, an NSA FWA UE group can be made according to SPID and an SA FWA UE group can be made according to S-NSSAI.

EN-DC and NR-DC split bearer can be enabled for FWA by configuring the CgSwitchCfg MO class. The following must be set to enable the split bearer:

- CgSwitchCfg.dlCgSwitchMode = Enabled
- CgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode = Enabled

The operator intention in this example is to keep FWA user data primarily in High-Band by using the following functional settings.

For EN-DC downlink PDCP aggregation is disabled and the SCG user-plane is configured for downlink data. Uplink PDCP aggregation is also disabled for the FWA QCI, but this is not differentiated in NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profiles and will be applied to all UEs configured with this QCI. EN-DC parameters are configured as follows:

- DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed = False
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpPreferredCg = SCG
- QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThreshold = -1 (applied to all MBB and FWA users for shared QCIs)

For NR-DC downlink PDCP aggregation is allowed, but the SCG is preferred for user traffic. This will prioritize usage of the high-band resources, but still allow FWA users to use mid/low-band as needed. This can also be disabled to use only high-band. NR-DC parameters are configured as follows:

- DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed = True
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpPreferredCg = SCG
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggCgPrio = SCG

For details, see LTE-NR Dual Connectivity and NR-NR Dual Connectivity.

#### 4.2.2.2 High-Band Traffic Steering Aspects

In this use case traffic steering allows MBB subscribers to only use the normal, not-extended High-Band cell range. Only FWA subscriber can make use of the full extended cell range.

For NR SA Mobility Control at Poor Coverage is configured to perform PSCell change or secondary node release in case of poor coverage on the High-Band. The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage search zone is configured uniquely for FWA users so that PSCell change occurs only at a very low RSRP, allowing FWA users to remain connected to the High-Band even in poor coverage in the extended range. The search zone for MBB users will steer away UEs when reaching low RSRP close to the normal cell range. The gNodeB parameter settings are similar to the ones shown for the Mid-Band NR SA FWA use case in section  Mid-Band Traffic Steering Aspects.

In case of NR-DC the RSRP A4 measurement report criteria when searching for a PSCell candidate can be set per UE Group. This allows to steer away MBB UEs when reaching low RSRP close to the normal cell range. The parameter for NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPSCellCandidate can be set accordingly.

With such setting, it provides two alternatives to handle the UEs from different groups in the network:

- Either to steer away MBB UEs in the group when reaching low RSRP threshold close to the normal cell range.
- Or to trigger NR-DC SN Release for FWA CPE devices in another group.
