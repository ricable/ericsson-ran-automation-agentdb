Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature performance can be degraded if the admission control threshold is reached

or the signal intensity is too high.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required to fully benefit from this

feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Overload Protection

The feature uses Connection Intensity Control and MP Load Control to optimize the use of

resources and avoid overload.

The MP Load Control has the following states and actions depending on CPU load:

Table 2   MP Load Control States

| MP Load Control States   | Actions                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OVERLOAD                 | The feature rejects all activities.                                                                     |
| VERY HIGH                | The feature rejects part of the traffic.                                                                |
| HIGH                     | The feature rejects activities that do not directly impact                                     traffic. |
| NOT HIGH                 | No load control activities are required.                                                                |

The feature uses Connection Intensity Control and MP Load Control to manage the

following procedures if the MP Load Control is in VERY HIGH or OVERLOAD state:

- RRC Connection Setup
- RRC Connection Resume
- RRC Connection Reestablishment
- Intra-gNodeB Handovers
- Xn and NG Inter-gNodeB Handovers
- Secondary Node Addition
- Intra-gNodeB PSCell Change
- Inter-gNodeB PSCell Change

The following procedure is affected if the connection intensity is too high or the MP

Load Control is in OVERLOAD state:

- NGAP and RAN Paging

## 3.1 Load Control of the Secondary Node Addition Procedure

The feature controls the Secondary Node Addition Procedure between the Master Node

and the Secondary Node.

The Master Node using the Secondary Node Addition procedure sends an X2AP SGNB

ADDITION REQUEST message to the Secondary Node to establish  SCG radio

resources for EN-DC-capable UEs. Multiple Master Nodes can send an X2AP SGNB

ADDITION REQUEST message to the Seondary Node simultaneously. If the

Secondary Node receives too many X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST messages

simultaneously or the CPU is overloading, the Secondary Node sends an X2AP SGNB

ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message to the Master Node. This method protects the

Secondary Node from overload.

For more information about the Secondary Node Addition procedure message, see LTE-NR Dual Connectivity.

## 3.2 Load Control of the RRC Setup Procedure

The feature controls the UE admission.

The RRC SETUP REQUEST message is sent to the Secondary Node to establish

connection between the UE and the Secondary Node.

When the UE admission is not available because of high connection intensity or CPU

overload, the Secondary Node sends an RRC REJECT message to the UE. This

message includes the waitTime attribute to set the waiting time between

1 and 16 seconds. The UE cannot attempt to establish

connection again until the waiting time elapses.

For more information about the RRC SETUP REQUEST message, see Random Access.

## 3.3 Load Control of the RRC Resume Procedure

The feature controls the RRC resume requests.

The RRC RESUME REQUEST message is sent to the Secondary Node to resume a

suspended RRC connection between the UE and the Secondary Node.

When the UE admission is not available because of high connection intensity or CPU

overload, the Secondary Node sends an RRC REJECT message to the UE. This

message includes the waitTime attribute to set the waiting time between

1 and 16 seconds. The UE cannot attempt to establish

connection again until the waiting time elapses.

For more information about the RRC RESUME REQUEST message, see Random Access and RRC Inactive State.

## 3.4 Load Control of the RRC Reestablishment Procedure

The feature controls the RRC reestablishment requests.

The RRC REESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message is sent to the Secondary Node by

the UE to reestablish the RRC connection between the UE and the Secondary Node.

When the UE admission is not available because of high connection intensity or CPU

overload, the Secondary Node ignores the RRC REESTABLISHMENT REQUEST

messages.

## 3.5 Load Control of the PSCell Change Procedure

The feature controls the Intra-gNodeB and Inter-gNodeB PSCell Change procedures in

EN-DC.

In EN-DC, the PSCell Change procedure is initiated by the Secondary Node when a received

measurement report indicates that the NR radio link quality is better in a neighbor

PSCell than it is in the serving PSCell. When the PSCell Change procedure is not

possible because of high connection intensity or CPU overload, a PM event is raised with

the cause of the unsuccessful PSCell Change attempt and a PM counter is stepped.

For more information about the Intra-gNodeB and Inter-gNodeB PSCell Change procedures in

EN-DC, see LTE-NR Dual Connectivity and NR Mobility.

## 3.6 Load Control of the Handover Procedure

The feature controls Intra-gNodeB and Inter-gNodeB handovers.

Intra-gNodeB Handover

In Intra-gNodeB handover, the UE is moved to a different cell on the same Secondary

Node. The handover is based on the UE measurement reports of the serving cell and

the neighbor cells. To initiate the handover, the Secondary Node sends an RRC

RECONFIGURATION message to the UE. When the handover is not possible

because of high connection intensity or CPU overload, a PM event is issued with the

cause of the unsuccessful handover attempt and a PM counter is stepped.

Xn and NG Inter-gNodeB Handover

In NG-based Inter-gNodeB handover, the UE is moved to a different Secondary Node. The

Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) sends a HANDOVER

REQUEST message to the target Secondary Node to initiate the handover.

When the handover is not possible because of high connection intensity or CPU

overload, the Secondary Node sends a HANDOVER FAILURE message to the

AMF, and a PM event is issued with the cause of the unsuccessful handover attempt

and a PM counter is stepped.

In Xn-based Inter-gNodeB handover, the UE is moved to a different Secondary Node. The

source Secondary Node sends a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target

Secondary Node to initiate the handover. When the handover is not possible because

of high connection intensity or CPU overload, the target Secondary Node sends a

HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source Secondary

Node, and a PM event is issued with the cause of the unsuccessful handover attempt

and a PM counter is stepped.

NG and Xn handovers for emergency call are prioritized in overload protection

algorithms.

## 3.7 Load Control of the Paging Procedure

The feature controls paging messages.

Paging messages are discarded by the Secondary Node when the intensity of paging is

higher than the threshold or the MP Load Control is in OVERLOAD state. Paging messages

can be the following:

- NGAP Paging
- RAN Paging

For more information about NGAP paging, see NR

Standalone and RRC Inactive State.

## 3.8 Priority Order

The feature uses a priority order based on the UE connection type.

The feature handles the incoming connection requests based on priority order. This method

provides the following

benefits:

- Minimized risk of rejecting emergency calls
- Enhanced system stability during CPU overload
- Decreasednumber of connection rejects

When traffic intensity is high on one connection level, the feature limits traffic first

on the lower connection levels of the priority order.

The feature uses the following priority order based on UE connection type:

    - Emergency calls and high priority access, when the UE sends an RRCSetupRequest message or an RRCResumeRequest message with one of the following causes: emergency highPriorityAccess mcs-PriorityAcccess mps-PriorityAccess The feature rejects these calls only in OVERLOAD state.
    - Emergency calls and high priority access in the Xn and NG Inter-gNodeBHandovers (including handovers for UEs in Limited-Service Mode). The feature rejects these calls only in OVERLOAD state.
- The feature prioritizes retaining the connection over accessibility for this connection type.
    - Ongoing NR standalone connections, where the UE sends a HandoverRequest or an RRCReestablishmentRequest message.
    - Ongoing NR standalone connections, where the UE sends an RRCResumeRequest message with one of the following causes: rna-update mo-data mo-Signalling mo-sms mo-VideoCall mo-VoiceCall mt-Access spare1-6
- New NR standalone connections, where the UE sends an RRCSetupRequest message with one of the following causes: mo-data mo-Signalling mo-sms mo-VideoCall mo-VoiceCall mt-Access spare1-6
- For UEs configured with EN-DC, when the Master Node sends an X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message or when the Secondary Node initiates the PSCell Change procedure. This connection type has the lowest priority because an LTE connection is already available.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Overload Protection

The feature makes the capacity and the performance of the network more

balanced.

Capacity and Performance

The feature protects the Secondary Node from overload and reduces CPU load while

minimizing the impact to the traffic.

Interfaces

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Summary and Benefits

This

enhancement has the following benefits:

- When security information is received in the NGAP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, an intra-cell handover is triggered according to the 3GPP standard. Security information is synchronized with the UE, and the UE is kept in connected state instead of UE release. The same applies to UEs in limited service mode, lifting a previous restriction in the NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support feature.
- NG and Xn handovers for emergency call are prioritized in overload protection algorithms.

The default list for the SecurityHandling.cipheringAlgoPrio

attribute is changed from NEA2,NEA1,NEA0 to NEA2,NEA1.
