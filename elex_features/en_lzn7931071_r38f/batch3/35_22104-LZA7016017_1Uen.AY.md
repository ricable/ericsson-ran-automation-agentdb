# 1 High Speed UE High-Band Overview

The High Speed UE High-Band feature provides the possibility to serve fast-moving UEs on

high-band frequencies. Urban speeds are considered, offering robust mobility for UEs

traveling at up to 100 km/h speed.

Summary

The High Speed UE High-Band feature can counteract the Doppler effect caused by the rapid

movement of a UE relative to the position of the base station antenna. This feature

can prevent the throughput reduction in these cases.

The feature allows maintaining a robust connection to terminals that are moving at a high

speed, both in uplink and downlink. Additional DMRSs are configured for PDSCH and

PUSCH. Considering the TDD 4:1 pattern, the configuration of additional DMRSs

reduces the UE peak rate both in the downlink and in the uplink.

The maximum UE speed is set through NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed.

# 2 Dependencies of High Speed UE High-Band

The LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature is a prerequisite to High Speed UE High-Band.

High Speed UE High-Band is also related to the Scheduler High-Band feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of High Speed UE High-Band

The High Speed UE High-Band feature makes it possible to compensate for the Doppler

effect caused by high-velocity users in a cell.

The High Speed UE High-Band feature is enabled on cell level.

When enabled, the High Speed UE High-Band feature introduces two additional DMRSs and

enables the PTRS on PDSCH and PUSCH. This is to compensate for the Doppler effect that

is introduced by a high speed UE that moves inside a cell at up to 100 km/h speed.

The High Speed UE High-Band feature is used in cells where it is expected that most users

are high-velocity users.

To enable Doppler compensation for high speed UEs, the following attributes must be

changed:

- For UEs moving at a speed reaching up to 50 km/h, NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed must be set to UP\_TO\_50KMPH.
- For UEs moving at a speed reaching up to 100 km/h, NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed must be set to UP\_TO\_100KMPH.

The NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled and the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attributes cannot be configured for the same

High-Band cell at the same time. When the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute is enabled, the following

configuration values cannot be configured for the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed

attribute:

- UP\_TO\_50KMPH
- UP\_TO\_100KMPH

# 4 Network Impact of High Speed UE High-Band

The peak throughput is negatively impacted by the High Speed UE High-Band

feature.

Capacity and Performance

Peak throughput is reduced both in the downlink and in the uplink. This is because

performance improvement is achieved through the configuration of two additional

DMRSs (1+1+1 DMRS) and a disabled PTRS. For UEs that do not support the 1+1+1 DMRS

configuration, performance improvement is achieved through the configuration of one

additional DMRS (1+1 DMRS) and an enabled PTRS.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

To achieve the required performance gain, the UE must support the 1+1+1 DMRS

configuration for both the PDSCH and the PUSCH channels.

# 5 Parameters for High Speed UE High-Band

High Speed UE High-Band introduces the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute

through which the maximum UE moving speed can be adjusted.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter           | Type       | Description          |
|---------------------|------------|----------------------|
| NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of High Speed UE High-Band

The High Speed UE High-Band feature has no directly associated KPIs, counters, or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for High Speed UE High-Band

## 8.1 Configure Maximum UE Speed

The maximum UE speed is set with the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed

attribute.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Set the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute to UP\_TO\_50KMPH for UEs moving at a speed reaching up to 50 km/h or to UP\_TO\_100KMPH for UEs moving at a speed reaching up to 100 km/h. Maximum UE Speed Value 50 km/h UP\_TO\_50KMPH 100 km/h UP\_TO\_100KMPH
3. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

High Speed UE High-Band ensures that a satisfactory throughput and robust connection

is maintained for UEs traveling at up to 100 km/h speed.

Operation

The maximum UE speed is set through NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed.

To enable Doppler compensation for high speed UEs moving at up to 100 km/h speed,

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed must be set to

UP\_TO\_100KMPH.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q2: Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band Configuration Update

The feature enhancement introduces a rule that prevents configuring two attributes at

the same time.

| Feature Name:           | Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band   | High Speed UE High-Band   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5145                                       | FAJ 121 5017              |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Coverage Extension                        | NR Base Package           |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4006                                       | FAJ 801 4002              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type:            | NR                                                 | NR                        |

The Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band and the High Speed UE High-Band

features are not compatible with each other. To avoid enabling a faulty configuration,

the configuration update introduces a rule that prevents configuring the

NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled and the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attributes at the same time.

Benefits

The configuration update prevents a faulty configuration on Baseband nodes.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement prevents performance degradation by introducing the

configuration update.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces a rule which affects the following parameters:

- NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled
- NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed

The above attributes cannot be configured for the same High-Band cell at the same

time. When the NRCellDU.dftSOfdmPuschEnabled attribute is

enabled, the following configuration values are not allowed for the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute:

- UP\_TO\_50KMPH
- UP\_TO\_100KMPH

The rule is enabled by default, and it does not affect pre-existing attribute

configurations that conflict with each other. When the rule is triggered, an error

message is displayed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
