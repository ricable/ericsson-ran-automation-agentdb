This document provides a description of the concepts of network synchronization, the

capabilities of the Ericsson Radio System (ERS) portfolio, the backhaul, fronthaul, and

RAT-specific synchronization requirements. The document aims to guide customers in the

planning and deployment of the synchronization network. It covers the following

topics:

- Basic synchronization concepts
- Differences between TDM-, Ethernet-, and IP-based synchronization

For more information on fronthaul structures with multiple DUs and Basebands connected to

the same RU, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.

The Network Synchronization Solution Guideline provides a

description of principles and guidelines for solution architects to design network

synchronization solutions. It covers the following aspects:

- Examples of solution design for different deployments
- Key checkpoints for configuration inspections and troubleshooting methods to facilitate network operations

The Radio Dot System shares hardware and

synchronization

software solutions with the Baseband Radio Node, but because of the specific

indoor

hardware architecture, there are some specific synchronization considerations described

in the NR Indoor and Venue Solution Guideline.

For more configuration information for the Baseband Radio

Nodes,

see Manage Network Synchronization.

Configuration information for non-Baseband Radio

Nodes

is found in the respective product library.

# 2 Network Synchronization Concepts

The goal of network synchronization is to ensure the frequency or time and phase alignment of

nodes in a network.

Originally, the nodes require only frequency synchronization. The clock sources are deployed

at designated switching sites, and synchronization information is distributed over physical

links, through PDH, SDH, Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE), or packet-based solutions.

In more advanced RAN and backhaul networks, frequency synchronization is not always enough,

and time and phase synchronization is also required.

A network synchronization network is built up by synchronization sources, synchronization

distribution nodes, and synchronization end application nodes. Only the synchronization end

application nodes use the frequency or time information for their operation. This is typically

the RBS. The other nodes only distribute frequency or time, but do not use the information for

their functional operation. For example, an Ethernet switch can distribute time, but it does

not require time information for its switching functionality.

The

Baseband

radio nodes can also be configured as

synchronization sources and synchronization distribution nodes.

Synchronization distribution can use one or multiple

methods.

The timing reference signals from the clock sources can be distributed in the following

ways:

- Over the physical layer with the following methods: PDH SDH GNSS SyncE for the RAN fronthaul over CPRI.
- In the network layer by packet-based methods, such as PTP.
- Over the air between the neighboring base stations.

In case of a single node, if no external synchronization references are available, the node

cannot start. But if the Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source feature is

activated and the node is restarted with rank COLD, the node can start and carry

traffic.

For more information, see Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source.

## 2.1 Frequency Synchronization

Frequency synchronization represents the alignment of clocks in terms of their repeating

interval (that is, frequency), but not in terms of phase or time.

Frequency synchronization ensures that frequency accuracy of radio carriers over the air

interface in the radio network meets 3GPP requirements. This requirement is 50 ppb.

In normal operation, clocks are synchronized to a reference signal that is traceable to a

Primary Reference Clock (PRC, based on ITU-T G.811) in the transport network.

This clock state is called frequency-locked mode.

When a fault occurs, a clock input can lose its traceability to the PRC. In this case, the

receiving device tries to remain synchronized based on the synchronization information that it

processed and stored while in locked state. This clock state is called frequency

holdover mode. In frequency holdover mode, accuracy degradation is observed at a different

degree depending on the stability of the internal oscillator.

Connection to the PRC is secured by implementing the synchronization network in redundant

structures. This prevents individual clocks from entering holdover mode, when a network

failure occurs.

## 2.2 Time and Phase Synchronization

Phase synchronization is defined as the relative alignment of a set of clock. Time

synchronization is defined as alignment of clocks to a common external time.

An RBS can be time synchronized or frequency synchronized. When the RBS is time

synchronized, it also meets the frequency synchronization requirements.

An RBS must be phase aligned between its components. This applies also when the RBS runs

FDD. For example, if two Baseband units are connected to the same radio unit, these Baseband

units have to be phase aligned, so they do not interfere with each other at the radio

unit.

The purpose of time and phase synchronization of TDD is to eliminate or reduce the

interference of radio carriers over the air interface. When RBS antennas are located close to

each other, signals that are transmitted over the air interface can interfere. This means that

the clocks must have their phases aligned accordingly. If the RBS antennas are located at

large distances from each other, the signals cannot interfere, and the clocks do not have to

be aligned. The maximum allowed error between RBS antennas by 3GPP is 3 microseconds. For

details see 3GPP TS

38.133

and 3GPP TS 36.133. In relation to an absolute time, this

translates to a ±1.5 μs accuracy requirement.

For FDD, functions like MBMS, UE positioning, or handover between NR and

LTE,

benefit from time and phase synchronization. For

example,

MBMS needs an accuracy of around 10 microseconds, while an UE can cope with around 30

microseconds at its antenna for non-contiguous Carrier Aggregation. UE positioning according

to emergency call related requirements has accuracy requirements which can only be met when

the RBS is time

locked

with a high accuracy synchronization reference. But positioning accuracy requirements are

stated as probability to find an UE within a certain area, which cannot be directly translated

into a RAN time synchronization accuracy requirement.

Time alignment is accomplished by synchronizing the clocks to a common time, referred to as

Radio Network Time. Such a source must be leap-second-free and have sufficient accuracy to

meet 3GPP requirements. The continuous availability of Radio Network Time is secured by

implementing the synchronization network in redundant structures. This prevents individual

clocks from entering holdover mode, when network failure occurs.

For NR TDD, the time alignment between Baseband Radio Nodes can be monitored through the

Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature. The feature allows time alignment measurements

at the antenna reference points on mid-band with NR TDD cells. If the node has other cells and

standards, the measurement results provided by the NR TDD mid-band cells can be deduced for

the other cells with a maximum of

±130 ns.

For more information, see Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring.

Radio Network Time can be acquired through either a GNSS or by time

distribution over packets, such as PTP. The GNSS receiver provides timing to Baseband Radio

Node by synchronizing its time with satellites. In the GNSS case, a satellite receiver is

connected directly to the RAN node.

PTP-based time and phase synchronization uses an IP or Ethernet network that consists of

clocks and synchronization functions. PTP packets use time stamps from the network interfaces

to carry the time information. For time distribution over a packet network, a Grandmaster

clock is the PTP time source, intermediate Boundary or Transparent Clock nodes distribute the

time, and the RBS nodes are the end application Nodes.

For more information, see Manage Network Synchronization.

## 2.3 Robustness

Since loss of synchronization of the RAN can cause service degradation and service loss

for TDD, it is important to have synchronization availability strategies.

Ericsson RAN nodes have functions to maintain synchronization and handle interruptions of

synchronization references in the Baseband Radio Nodes.

Frequency Synchronization

For the frequency, the only synchronization case for FDD without additional

functionality requiring time synchronization, backup frequency synchronization can

be configured according to a strict-priority scheme. If there is no working backup

reference, the radio equipment clock enters the frequency holdover state. This state

can be maintained within 3GPP specifications with no KPI degradation for several

months, and with only minor KPI degradation for years.

Time Synchronization

For time synchronization, backup references must not be configured as strict

priority. Instead, the Assisted Time Holdover feature must be used for

synchronization reference backup. By using the Assisted Time Holdover feature, a

smooth shift between the primary synchronization reference and the backup

synchronization reference is assured.

Any difference in the time delivered by the different references is compensated to

follow the time of the primary reference. By this, disruptive time jumps of the air

interface which could result in cell downtime are avoided.

Assisting Reference Types

The following reference types can be applied as assisting references:

- G.8275.1 PTP over Ethernet (AFTS)
- G.8275.2 PTP over IP (APTS)
- Synchronous Ethernet (Assisting SyncE) Note: It is recommended that the Synchronous Ethernet path differs from the G.8275.1 PTP over Ethernet path. This means that to benefit fully from Network Synchronization, the PTP Grandmaster, and the source of the Synchronous Ethernet path cannot be the same equipment.
- OTA (only for NR TDD)

Baseband Radio Nodes can be configured with G.8275.1 PTP over Ethernet and GNSS as

primary references. PTP assisting references are limited only to support GNSS as

primary reference.

In a cascaded setup,

Baseband

nodes that are configured as boundary clocks distribute SyncE to

cascaded Ericsson Baseband nodes within one hop. Cascaded Baseband nodes use the

SyncE source as assisting reference. If the primary reference fails, this keeps

time-dependent services enabled, and allows cascaded Baseband nodes to synchronize

with the Baseband node configured as boundary clock.

Figure 1   Network View of Assisting SyncE in a Cascaded Setup

SLA Monitoring

Measurements for PTP over IP can be performed with the SLA monitoring of APTS

references. The SLA monitoring occurs according to the metrics and network limits

defined in the ITU-T G.8271.2 for reference point C of network reference model. The

SLA monitoring can only be performed when the Baseband Radio Node uses the GNSS as a

primary reference.

Time Holdover Mode

If there is no working assisting reference, or the assisting reference is not

monitored for one hour and qualified for assistance, the radio equipment clock

enters the time holdover mode. The duration for which services can be maintained in

time holdover differs, depending on the service and for how long the time

synchronization algorithm machine learning is trained. It can be expected that a

±1.5 µs accuracy, for example TDD, can be maintained for one to five hours if the

primary time synchronization reference is GNSS. If the primary time synchronization

reference is PTP, the main dependency is the PTP path maximum error from Grandmaster

to Baseband Radio Node. The larger the error in the PTP path, the shorter the

duration of the support of services. With a PTP path error of 1,100 ns or higher,

there is no holdover duration for the ±1.5 µs TDD requirement. If the PTP path error

is close to zero, the duration is comparable to GNSS synchronization.

Configuring a backup priority-controlled frequency reference to a time synchronized

Baseband Radio Node is not required for TDD and FDD.

If the radio clock state shifts from time holdover to frequency holdover, the

frequency stability of the radio clock is sufficient to keep the frequency stability

for basic FDD for several months. Switching to another frequency synchronization

reference only increases the risks for synchronization instabilities.

## 2.4 Quality Level Management

The concept of

quality

level

represents information about the quality (for example frequency accuracy) of the source in the

synchronization trail.

In synchronization networks, timing is transferred between clocks in either

primary-secondary

or server-client fashion. Quality Level carries information about the traceability of a

synchronization reference, not the quality. Dedicated test instruments assess the quality.

For Synchronous Ethernet, Quality Level is carried by ESMC, which is one of the Ethernet slow

protocols. A slow protocol is terminated at every Ethernet switch. For PTP, the Quality level

is carried in the PTP messages.

If Quality Level is applied to frequency synchronization networks, it

provides

the following

benefits:

- The best available network synchronization quality can be propagated downstream in a transport network. This is possible because each node can select the synchronization reference with the best Quality Level.
- An end node, for example, a NodeB or eNodeB, can decide whether the Quality Level of network synchronization on an interface is sufficient for its operations. This is achieved by defining a minimum Quality Level for the synchronization reference.
- If the ESMC extended TLV is supported, the Assisted Time Holdover feature using Synchronous Ethernet as assisting reference, can automatically assess the usefulness of the assisting reference.

There are three different sets of Quality Levels based on the ETSI, ANSI, and TTC

standards,

corresponding

to options I, II, and III. A network must use only one of these options.

Quality Levels in PTP are implemented with parameters, for example,

clockClass, clockAccuracy,

timeTraceable. These are combined into a Quality Level to provide a

common reference.

## 2.5 Network Synchronization Plan

The Network Synchronization Plan (NSP) consists of a set of documents, tables, and diagrams

that provide the description of the synchronization network.

The NSP is custom-made for each individual network. It is recommended to prepare and maintain

an NSP for the operator. Any changes to the network must be implemented according to the NSP.

Synchronization-related implications can be evaluated before implementation to prevent any

service degradation. After implementation, the NSP

must

be updated to highlight the new network structure.

The NSP describes the topology of the synchronization chain. This includes the locations of

the primary synchronization sources and how the timing signals are distributed throughout the

network to the base stations. The multiplicity of clock sources and path diversity is also

described to highlight redundancy strategies that implement robustness. The NSP indicates the

nodes that are deployed in the network and the properties of the related clock types. On a

node level, the inputs and priorities of synchronization references are also defined.

Furthermore, links and associations that convey synchronization information must also be

detailed.

# 3 Synchronization in PDH, SDH, or Synchronous Ethernet Networks

PDH, SDH, and SyncE transport networks accomplish the distribution of timing information

over the physical layer. Through the physical connection, the RBS can extract the frequency

reference signal at a constant bit rate.

Physical transmission chains cannot be indefinitely long. When the number of SDH

Equipment Clocks (SEC) exceeds the threshold given in the ITU-T G.803 standard,

the noise tolerance limit of the receiving clock can also be exceeded. To regenerate the clocks,

it is recommended to deploy SSUs. The ITU-T G.8261 standard extends this

reference architecture to include devices that host an EEC.

In normal operation, the SEC or EEC clocks are synchronized in TimeTransmitter-TimeReceiver

mode. Each clock receives synchronization information from the previous device and passes it

on to the next device in the chain. This arrangement does not apply to pure PDH

cross-connects, which are based on free-running oscillators.

Not all transport devices include a system clock that locks to a selected reference and

controls outputs accordingly. Point-to-point transmission devices, such as SDH

regenerators, provide only output from one direction to the other, and in reverse.

# 4 Synchronization in Packet Networks

Network synchronization in a packet-based network is performed by using time stamps that are

inserted in IP packets or in Ethernet frames. There are two protocols that support network

synchronization over packets: the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the Precision Time Protocol

(PTP).

For the Ericsson RBS, NTP can be used for frequency synchronization, while PTP can be used

for both frequency or time and phase synchronization.

If an application requires only frequency synchronization, the time servers do not require an

absolute time reference such as GPS. An accurate frequency reference, for example, a 2-MHz

signal with PRC quality, is sufficient. When the application needs time and phase

synchronization, the reference must be leap second-free.

The NTP client, or the PTP TimeReceiver, extracts the synchronization information from the

packets by using a Differential Time Method algorithm (DTM). DTM algorithms are based on the

time differences between a time server and a time client. The packet delays are computed from

the time stamps of the server and the client. This allows the client to do the following:

- Calculate the frequency drift of its oscillator.
- Compare the frequency of the oscillator to the frequency of the time server.
- Tune the client clock to the time server.

## 4.1 Frequency Synchronization Using NTP Packets

The IP synchronization reference consists of an NTP client in the node and an associated NTP

server in another node.

If an Ericsson RNC is available, the most cost-effective solution is using embedded NTP

servers. The RNC can be synchronized with any frequency references, for example a 2048-kHz

source. Otherwise, any third-party NTP servers can be used. In either case, the solution

requires PRC-quality sources.

Figure 2   Frequency Distribution with NTP

The capability of the base station to recover an accurate frequency reference depends on the

PDV of the NTP packets. PDV is caused by the queueing time in the switches and routers. The

QoS policies are recommended to have the highest priority on NTP packets in the backhaul

network.

## 4.2 Synchronization Using PTP Packets

PTP can be used for the frequency synchronization or the time and phase synchronization of an

RBS.

The PTP synchronization reference consists of a PTP TimeReceiver in the RBS and an associated

PTP Grandmaster clock in another node.

A RAN node can also provide a PTP time and phase synchronization source by enabling the RAN Grand Master feature.

A PTP network can operate in two modes: multicast or unicast. In the multicast mode, PTP

packets are sent from the TimeTransmitter clock to all TimeReceiver clocks in the multicast

domain. In the unicast mode, a TimeReceiver clock in the PTP network sets up a subscription

for PTP packets in a Grandmaster clock.

The IEEE 1588v2 standard defines the Best TimeTransmitter Clock Algorithm (BTCA)

algorithm. The algorithm selects the TimeTransmitter clock with the best precision in the PTP

domain by exchanging information between clocks in the network.

PTP Profiles

PTP profiles contain specific selections of attribute values, and PTP features that meet

the requirements of a particular application. These profiles define the Alternate-BTCA

algorithms, configuration management options, path delay mechanism, the range and default

values of PTP attributes, and so on. The following profiles are supported by the Ericsson

Radio System:

### 4.2.1 PTP for Frequency Synchronization

Frequency synchronization is based on the ITU-T G.8265.1 PTP profile, which

describes the use of UDP over IP in unicast transmission mode. This profile does not

require the application of boundary or transparent clocks. The profile recommends the

use of at least two TimeTransmitter clocks in the network to increase network

reliability. The time budget for this profile is given in ITU-T

G.8261.1.

The ITU-T G.8265.1 profile implementation in the RBS is also compatible with the IEEE 1588-2008

default profiles. This means that both specific ITU-T G.8265.1 and standard IEEE 1588-2008

equipment can be used.

Figure 3   IEEE 1588 Network View for Frequency Synchronization

An RBS can have as many as eight alternative synchronization references. Each

synchronization reference is a TimeReceiver clock and has a corresponding

TimeTransmitter clock. Individual TimeReceiver clocks can be connected to different

TimeTransmitter clocks.

TimeReceiver clocks receive information about the quality of TimeTransmitter clocks

through the PTP protocol. The clock quality includes information about clock class and

clock accuracy. A PTP TimeReceiver chooses the TimeTransmitter with the highest

priority, if the TimeTransmitter provides a clock with sufficiently good quality. This

quality must be in accordance with predefined values for clock class and clock

accuracy.

### 4.2.2 PTP for Time and Phase Synchronization

The PTP network for time and phase synchronization consists of the following elements:

- Grandmaster clocks are mandatory elements of the PTP networks. They act as the time server to provide high-precision time stamps.
- Boundary clocks are optional elements of the PTP network. One PTP port operates as a TimeReceiver clock, while the other ports operate as the TimeTransmitter to all other clocks in the synchronization chain.
- Transparent clocks are optional elements of the PTP network. They calculate the transit time of PTP packets and add the calculated value to the dedicated field in the PTP header. The transparent clock is not a TimeTransmitter clock.
- TimeReceiver-only ordinary clock is the end-node TimeTransmitter clocks in the synchronization trail.

The Ericsson implementation in the RBS of ITU-T G.8275.2 includes support for a mode that

uses more relaxed network limits than those specified in ITU-T G.8271.2. This mode is

intended for synchronization of FDD nodes involved in EN-DC (NR non-standalone

networks). For more information, see IEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization.

To implement time synchronization with Full Timing Support, every node along the chain

between the TimeTransmitter and TimeReceiver clocks must support the PTP boundary clock

or transparent clock functions.

Figure 4   IEEE 1588 Network View for Time and Phase Synchronization

For partial timing support, not all nodes have to have the boundary clock or transparent

clock functionality. This results in increased time errors over the network. In this

case, two options are available: Partial Timing Support (PTS) and Assisted Partial

Timing Support (APTS).

In PTS, the RBS establishes a PTP over IP unicast session with ITU-T G.8275.2 compliant

Grandmaster clocks, while the backhaul network is unaware of the PTP. This ITU-T

recommendation puts a strict requirement on accuracy of the time delivered to the RBS,

and it is up to the operator to assure these requirements are met. Practical experience

shows that the requirements are often difficult to fulfill for TDD, but that PTS is

often usable for FDD with carrier aggregation (which has less strict time

synchronization requirements).

In APTS, the RBS is supplied with a local GNSS reference and another PTP input provided

by a Grandmaster clock in the network. When the RBS tracks the GNSS, it can also

evaluate the PTP input and determine the related offset. When a GNSS failure occurs, the

RBS enters holdover and compensates the PTP timing information with the calculated

offset. The assisting APTS time reference can be selected on Baseband Radio Node startup

without the need for the one-hour reevaluation period. This functionality is activated

through the Assisted Time Holdover feature.

# 5 Over-the-Air Synchronization

Time synchronization between two radio nodes across the radio interface is supported for

NR TDD.

The

Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature is used for this synchronization method.

It measures the radio frame phase difference between the downlink signal from the

neighbor radio node and the local radio equipment clock.

These measurements can be used by the Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature to

maintain time synchronization for a certain period in case the primary time

synchronization reference is temporarily interrupted. The period depends on the

stability of the measurements, radio signal conditions and the available holdover budget

on the node.

Since one radio unit can

be

connected to several

neighboring

radio nodes, an automatic selection method is used to find the best

radio neighbor to synchronize with.

A prerequisite for Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature is that the Radio

Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature is enabled on the same node.

# 6 Network Synchronization with ERS Products

The Ericsson Radio System (ERS) portfolio supports various solutions for both frequency

and time and phase-based synchronization. This includes synchronization options based on

GNSS, Synchronous Ethernet, NTP, and PTP for GSM, WCDMA, LTE, and NR networks. The

portfolio also includes third-party time servers.

## 6.2 Synchronization of Baseband Nodes

A baseband node can be configured to execute one or several RANs. All RANs running

simultaneously on the baseband node shares the same network synchronization function.

This means synchronization must be configured according to the most demanding RAN or

feature executing on the node.

The node only time synchronizes in the following cases:

1. A time synchronization reference is configured and accepted by the synchronization function.
2. An NR RAN is configured on the node.
3. An LTE RAN is configured on the node and the the EUtranCellTDD.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment attribute to true.Note: Setting the ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchCritical to true makes the node time synchronize, but this attribute gives a node less resilience.

The network synchronization function is divided into the following parts:

- The selection of the synchronization reference with filtering.
- The distribution of synchronization signals.

Frequency synchronization references can either be dedicated signals, such as GNSS, 1PPS, or

traffic-carrying lines. The traffic port references can be further distinguished by the

format in which they carry the timing information. For the PDH, SDH, and Synchronous

Ethernet traffic ports, the framing carries the timing information. Packet

synchronization references, either NTP or PTP, carry the timing information in

time-stamped packets.

Time and phase synchronization references can be provided through the GNSS interface or

through PTP. For GNSS, the Ericsson receiver must be used. From GRU04 and onwards,

remote software update of the receiver is supported. For PTP, the ITU-T G.8275.1, ITU-T

G.8275.2 telecom profiles, and the IEEE 1588-2008 Time Default and Time Slow profiles

are supported. For Baseband Radio

Nodes,

the IEEE 1588 Custom profile is also supported.

Time synchronization of the NR mid-band TDD node can also be backed up by neighbor nodes

using a synchronization connection across the radio interface.

The radio equipment clock of the Baseband Radio Node has a high stability oscillator and

a synchronization algorithm with an adaptive bandwidth. This enables it to lock quickly

to the selected time or frequency reference. Once it is locked to the reference, it

withstands frequency and phase variations and trains its holdover capability. To enable

short restart times, the parameters of the adaptive algorithm are stored in a

non-volatile memory. If no references are available, it uses the holdover capability to

maintain phase and frequency alignment until a reference becomes available again.

The Radio Equipment Clock executes on a RAN Compute (Baseband) unit. With a CPRI

fronthaul network, time and phase information is carried from the RAN Compute unit to

the

radio

unit through the phase of the CPRI signal. For an eCPRI fronthaul

network, time and phase is carried by PTP on Ethernet.

### 6.2.1 Synchronization Functionality

The synchronization functionality is described in the following basic and optional

features:

- Synchronization subsystem features: Clock Source over GPS Multiple GNSS Support Clock Source over NTP Assisted Time Holdover IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization RAN Grandmaster Synchronous Ethernet Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source Note: This feature conflicts with other synchronization subsystem features, NR-specific synchronization features, and LTE-specific synchronization features.
- NR-specific synchronization features: Radio-Interface based Time Monitoring Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover Note: This feature is a combined NR and synchronization feature.
- LTE-specific synchronization features Fallback from Time and Phase Synchronization SIB16 Time Information Broadcast Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load

In a WCDMA network, the synchronization client for IP transport is identical to the Clock

Source over NTP feature which is related to the NTP server functionality built into the

Ericsson RNC.

The following functions are special solution-oriented synchronization functions:

- Synchronization for Elastic RAN
- Synchronization of shared radio units
- eCPRI networks with switches in the fronthaul network

For more information, see Network Synchronization Solution Guideline and Manage Node Group Synchronization

For LTE eDRX, 3GPP specifies a loose synchronization is required. This type of time and phase

synchronization is activated automatically when eDRX is activated. The functionality uses the

Calendar Clock of the RBS. No special Radio Clock synchronization configuration is

required.

### 6.2.2 Radio Equipment Clock

The network synchronization function is implemented in the Radio Equipment Clock, which

provides reference for air interface synchronization and for internal synchronization users in

the node. It generates the basic 10 ms radio frame tick and the basic radio frame counter.

The radio equipment clock is tailored for radio performance. It is built around a high

stability oscillator and has a synchronization algorithm that adjusts the time and frequency.

This enables it to lock quickly to the selected time or frequency reference, and to withstand

frequency and phase variations once locked. To enable short restart times, the parameters of

the adaptive algorithm are stored in a non-volatile memory.

During frequency synchronization, the high stability oscillator has a frequency within the

3GPP accuracy requirements from start, so when locking to a frequency synchronization

reference, there is no impact to the RAT executing on the node.

For time and phase synchronization, when locking to the reference, it might be required to

jump the basic frame counter of the Radio Equipment Clock to get in sync with the reference.

During the jump, the RAT cells are disabled to avoid network disturbances.

The radio equipment clock can be in the clock states FREQUENCY\_LOCKED,

RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED, or TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED when synchronized

to a reference. The TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED represents a state where the clock is

locked to the time reference, but waiting for a node internal request to jump the basic frame

counter. When the node synchronizes by jumping the basic frame counter, internal node

communication assures that cells are temporarily disabled during the synchronization

forlopp.

A basic radio frame counter jump can happen in the following events:

- When the node is configured for frequency synchronization, and it is reconfigured to use time synchronization and the applicable feature is enabled.
- When the node is configured for time synchronizationif all time synchronization references fail, the node goes to RNT\_TIME\_HOLDOVER, and then FREQUENCY HOLDOVER. When the failed time reference comes back and the time of the reference differs more than 10 μs from the basic frame counter time, the jump occurs.

### 6.2.3 Mixed Mode Baseband and ESS Aspect of Network Synchronization

Mixed Mode Baseband and ESS allow multi-standard operation with two or three RATs in a

single Baseband unit in a Baseband Radio Node. For more information, see Mixed Mode

Baseband and Mixed Mode Guidelines.

Since there is only one instance of the Radio Equipment clock on a Radio node, all RATs

running on the node are inherently synchronous with each other. As Mixed Mode Baseband

and ESS

allow

more than one radio network to operate on the same baseband hardware, the following

synchronization aspects apply to the radio networks regarding frequency

synchronization:

- GSM might require time synchronization, but it is sufficient if the synchronization function reaches the TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED state.
- WCDMA does not require time synchronization.
- LTE FDD might require time synchronization, but the accuracy depends on the accuracy requirements of the activated features.
- LTE TDD always requires time synchronization.
- NR FDD and TDD require time synchronization.

For an NR and LTE network, the synchronization function must transit from

TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED state to RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED state

to meets the LTE and NR accuracy requirements. During the transition, the cells are

disabled and the radio equipment clock makes a phase jump to acquire the correct radio

network time. For the node that uses Mixed Mode Baseband, a phase jump can be requested

by any radio network application operating on the baseband.

In LTE, it is possible to control the state transition to

RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED state by setting one of the following attributes to

true:

- ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment
- ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchCritical

### 6.2.4 Synchronization for Nodes in Isolated Mode

A node enters isolated mode after the Node Deployment without External

Synchronization Source feature is

activatedand

the node is restarted with rank COLD.

The Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source feature allows the node to

carry traffic when no external synchronization references are available. Other

synchronization-related or position-related features cannot work together with this

feature. For more information, see Node Deployment without External Synchronization Source.

## 6.3 Router 6000 Nodes Distribution of Synchronization

Router 6000 is the range of IP Routers products designed to integrate Ericsson Radio

Access Network (RAN) and backhaul solution. It supports both frequency, and time and

phase synchronization.

For frequency synchronization, up to four sources can be programmed by the operator for

the clock selection process. The possible candidate sources can be selected from the

following signal types:

- Recovered clock from synchronous Ethernet port
- Recovered clock from BITS port 2.048 MHz, E1/T1 Note: Not all Router 6000 models support this function. The BITS port provides one external synchronization output.
- Recovered clock from ITU-T G.8265.1 Ordinary Clock (OC) TimeReceiver clock
- 1PPS signal provided by 1PPS and ToD ports

For time and phase synchronization, the following options are supported:

- ITU-T G.8275.1 Boundary Clock (T-BC) and Grandmaster clock (T-GM) with Ethernet encapsulation.
- IEEE 1588v2 Boundary Clock (BC) and Grandmaster clock (GM) with Ethernet encapsulation.
- ITU.T G.8275.2 Boundary Clock-partial (T-BC-P) and Grandmaster clock (T-GM) with unicast encapsulation (both IPv4 and IPv6).
- GNSS through the 1PPS and TOD ports as Grandmaster source. The same GNSS receiver as for the radio Nodes is used.

When the Router 6000 node is configured as a

Grandmaster

and is directly connected to a

radio

node, the G.827.1 can be used as an alternative.

The time and phase synchronization function can benefit of a stable clock

frequency that is provided by the frequency synchronization function. These benefits include increased

stability and extended time holdover capability of the equipment.

## 6.4 Synchronization of MINI-LINK Nodes

In MINI-LINK, frequency synchronization is handled by the Netsync function. The internal

oscillator can be frequency synchronized to any physical interface that can carry

synchronization. Another option is a clock signal that is recovered by the PTP protocol.

Out of all potential synchronization sources, four interfaces can be selected to be

connected to the source selection logic. The possible candidate sources can be selected

from the following signal types:

- Recovered clock from Synchronous Ethernet port
- Recovered clock from BITS port 2.048 MHz, E1/T1
- Recovered clock from ITU-T G.8265.1 Ordinary Clock (OC) TimeReceiver clock
- Recovered clock from a radio link through a microwave signal

For time and phase synchronization, the following options are supported:

- ITU-T G.8275.1
- IEEE 1588v2 Boundary Clock (BC) with Ethernet encapsulation

Boundary Clock (T-BC) with EthernetTime and phase synchronization is provided by the PTP

protocol. It can use the ITU-T G.8275.1 or the IEEE 1588-2008 Default PTP

profile. It synchronizes the Real-Time Clock (RTC) of the node to an external time

reference through exchange of PTP packets. The time and phase synchronization function

relies on stable clock frequency that is provided using the Netsync function based on

physical layer frequency synchronization signals. Another prerequisite is to enable and

lock the Netsync function to a Primary Reference Clock (PRC) source before time and

phase synchronization is activated.

## 6.5 Synchronization of WDM Fronthaul Equipment

Fronthaul products provide the transmission of signals through CPRI from Baseband units

to Remote Radio Units.

The Fiber Fronthaul 6080 product family allows for CPRI transport solutions over

DWDM.

From a network synchronization perspective, the fronthaul units do not perform any

special function, they behave transparently.

Fiber fronthaul units multiplex the CPRI traffic onto Layer 1 DWDM frames and transport

it from Baseband to radio.

# 7 Backhaul Requirements for Synchronization

In various network implementations, the backhaul is expected to provide the nodes with

suitable synchronization references of the required quality. For example, this is the

case when Synchronous Ethernet is used to deliver frequency, or when packet techniques

are used to deliver either frequency or phase.

## 7.1 Frequency Synchronization Requirements

The 3GPP frequency accuracy requirement of the air interface is ± 50 ppb from the nominal

frequency. To achieve this, the synchronization network is designed to include a PRC

source. The RBS can use the following methods to retrieve its frequency reference:

- Synchronization over packets with the Network Time Protocol (NTP) or the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
- Synchronous Ethernet

### 7.1.1 Synchronous Ethernet Requirements

When using Synchronous Ethernet in the backhaul, the frequency accuracy at the input of

the RBS must be better than 16 ppb. The delivery of frequency synchronization assumes

that at least one PRC source is deployed somewhere in the network. Traceability to this

source must be maintained from the source to the RBS input. In addition, the

accumulated jitter and wander must remain within the recommended limits of the

ITU-T G.8261, ITU-T G.8262, ITU-T G.823, and

ITU-T G.824 standards.

Quality Level is carried by the Ethernet Synchronization Messaging Channel (ESMC) as

Synchronization Status Messages (SSM). If a particular SyncE reference lacks SSM, an

administrative Quality Level can be assigned to it. The RBS can also be configured to

operate without Quality Level information. In this case, it cannot detect Quality Level

related impairments in the synchronization network based on the received Quality

Level.

For configuring SyncE as an assisting time reference, GNSS or PTP with G.8275.1 profile

must be available as time reference. For more information about configuring SyncE as an

assisting reference, see Manage Network Synchronization.

### 7.1.2 Frequency Synchronization Requirements for PTP and NTP

Frequency synchronization delivery to the RBS can also be based on time servers sending

time-stamped packets to the clients. Such packet-based methods are introduced in the

ITU-T G.8261, Y.1361 Timing and synchronization aspects in packet

networks standard.

Two protocols can be employed, either NTP or PTP, consistently with the specifications

provided in ITU-T G.8265.1 Precision time protocol telecom profile for frequency

synchronization.

As the application is frequency synchronization delivery, TAI or GNSS provision to the

servers is not required. A PRC quality reference is supplied to either the NTP server or

the PTP Grandmaster.

The ability of the RBS to retrieve a frequency reference that meets the accuracy

requirements over the air interface depends upon the PDV at RBS input. The node cannot

be synchronized if the PDV is larger than 10 ms.

The PDV accumulation is because of the queueing in the switches and routers. It is highly

recommended to implement QoS policies in the backhaul, so that the NTP or PTP packets

are processed with the highest priority.

## 7.2 Time and Phase Synchronization Requirements

The time accuracy requirement at the air interface varies for each feature.

For example, the requirement for TDD small cell features is ± 1.5 microseconds relative

to the Radio Network Time. For TDD large cell features, this requirement is ± 5

microseconds. It is possible to set these values to other values. For more information

see Fallback from Time and Phase Synchronization.

Time and phase synchronization requires traceability to a common time reference, for

example Radio Network Time.

The RBS can use one of the following methods to retrieve its time reference:

- Direct connection to an Ericsson GNSS receiver
- Synchronization over packets with the PTP

### 7.2.1 Time and Phase Synchronization Requirements for PTP

The delivery of time synchronization to the RBS can be accomplished by using the PTP

protocol. For this, at least one Grandmaster clock must be deployed in the network.

The time distribution architecture depends on the support of Boundary Clocks or Transparent

Clocks in the backhaul nodes.

If the backhaul nodes support these PTP functions, the solution can be based on the

ITU-T

G.8275.1 or

IEEE 1588 Custom profile for full timing support, which

specifies the following:

- If the ITU-T G.8275.1 profile is used, the backhaul network between the Grandmaster and RBS has Ethernet connectivity.
- If the IEEE 1588 Custom profile is used, the backhaul network between the Grandmaster and RBS has IP connectivity.
- All nodes between the Grandmaster and RBS implement Boundary Clock or Transparent Clock functions.
- The Time Error limits are according to subclause 7.3 of the ITU-T G.8271.1 standard.

If the backhaul nodes do not support these, the solution can be based on the ITU-T

G.8275.2 profile for Partial Timing Support (PTS). It specifies the following:

- PTP packets are mapped onto IP.
- Some nodes between the Grandmaster and RBS can implement Boundary Clock functions.
- The Time Error limits are according to subclause 7.3.1 of the ITU-T G.8271.2 standard for Assisted Partial Timing Support (APTS), and subclause 7.3.2 for PTS.

In this case, it is possible to have PTS architectures or an APTS structure. APTS consists

of providing the end application with a local time reference, such as a GNSS receiver. This

reference operates together with the PTP reference and is traceable to the same time source as

the local reference. The RBS uses this as the primary time reference. While locked to the

GNSS, it is used to qualify the PTP input by measuring the relative constant time error, and

peak-to-peak time error. While the relative constant time error can have any values, the

peak-to-peak time error must be less than 1100 ns. If a GNSS error occurs, the PTP input is

used. The RBS can use the stored time error data and use the PTP timing information to extend

the period for which the time synchronization is maintained.

The overall 1500-nanosecond Time Error budget is split between the Grandmaster (100 ns), end

application (400 ns), and the backhaul (1000 ns). This is applicable for both partial and full

timing support. The backhaul must ensure that the Time Error at the RBS input does not exceed

the 1100-nanosecond threshold. Other factors, such as constant time error, dynamic time error,

and asymmetries must also be considered.

# 8 GSM Aspects of Network Synchronization

In the GSM RAN, synchronization is taken from the synchronous clock of the TDM

transmission chain in the following cases:

- For Abis over TDM
- For Site Transport Nodes such as SIU, TCU configured in ML-PPP mode

For Abis over IP using Ethernet, NTP servers or PTP Grandmasters must be installed

in the network. Synchronous Ethernet can also be used for frequency synchronization.

## 8.1 Frequency and Time Synchronization in GSM

Frequency synchronization is required in a Baseband Radio Node that serves a GSM cell.

Frequency synchronization in a Baseband Radio Node can be achieved through the following

methods:

- GNSS as RAN Synchronization Reference
- NTP Frequency Synchronization
- Frequency synchronization using PTP
- Time and Phase Synchronization from a PTP Grandmaster
- Synchronous Ethernet

GNSS and PTP can be used to achieve both time and frequency synchronization. The Baseband

Radio Node monitors the synchronization, go into holdover mode, and raise an alarm if

problems occur with synchronization. If cell supervision is activated, the BSC raises an

alarm when synchronization problems disrupt the operation of channels in a cell.

## 8.2 Synchronization of Cells in a GSM Radio Network

Synchronization of cells allows a more efficient utilization of the spectrum with the possibility

to do orthogonal frequency hopping. The benefit is increased traffic capacity without

additional frequency requirements.

The synchronized cells can be deployed in a small area within Transceiver Groups, or in a

large area as part of a Synchronized Radio Network.

To synchronize a radio network, a common timing reference must be used for cell alignment.

This can be achieved in two ways:

- The Transceiver Groups in the synchronized radio network have a Radio Network Time (RNT) reference.
- The Transceiver Groups in the synchronized radio network have the BTS Soft Synchronization feature activated.

These methods can be combined within the same synchronized radio network for Transceiver Group synchronization.

Figure 5   Synchronization of Transceiver Groups in Multiple Sites

An RNT reference can be supplied to the BTS through a GPS receiver, Node Group

Synchronization, or the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization feature.

In BTS Soft Synchronization, the BSC provides the common reference to which the

Transceiver Groups align their time. For this, the BSC must be connected to either a GPS

receiver or an external NTP server. For more information see User Description, Synchronized Radio Networks in the GSM RAN library.

# 9 WCDMA Aspects of Network Synchronization

WCDMA networks use FDD technology, which means that the applications do not require phase

alignment between the base stations; only frequency synchronization is needed. Network

Synchronization in WCDMA RAN deals with the stability of the clocks and meeting the 3GPP

requirements of the Iu, Iub, and Uu interfaces.

The objective is the distribution of PRC-traceable clock references to the RNC and the

NodeBs. These references are used to synchronize the outgoing PDH, SDH, SONET links, the radio

interface, and the internal functions of the nodes. Such clock references can either be

derived from the transmission network or from standalone synchronization devices.

For IP connected NodeBs, the accurate frequency references to the RNC enables the

distribution of synchronization information to the NodeBs. This is done through NTP packets in

Iub over IP transport connections, when the NTP server function is activated in the RNC.

## 9.1 Synchronization of ATM-Connected Radio Nodes

WCDMA ATM networks are synchronized according to the TimeTransmitter-TimeReceiver model. Each

node can have a synchronization source from any of the following solutions:

- Other WCDMA RAN nodes
- SDH or PDH transport nodes
- Dedicated sources, such as GNSS receivers or Stand Alone Synchronization Equipment (SASE)

Figure 6   Synchronization Network in WCDMA RAN

The RNC can be synchronized over the Iu interface from a collocated MGW and distribute

synchronization to NodeBs in the backhaul network. For collocated nodes, the preferred

synchronization source is an SASE, if it is available on site.

It is recommended that the timing references are traceable to a clock source of PRC quality,

or at least SSU quality. For more information, see the ITU-T G.812 and

ITU-T G.811 standards.

To prevent link failures that lead to out-of-sync situations or timing loops, unprotected

links and ring structures must be also considered. In such cases, the deployment of dedicated

synchronization sources, either GNSS or SASE, is recommended. Connecting a GPS synchronization

source directly to the RNC is not supported. The GPS port is reserved for the Assisted GPS

(A-GPS) feature.

## 9.2 Synchronization of IP-Connected Radio Nodes

Network synchronization for an IP-connected radio node is achieved by aligning the frequency

of the radio node to the frequency of an NTP server. This server must be traceable to an

ITU-T G.811 compliant clock source. The NTP server is integrated into the RNC,

but a standalone NTP server can also be used, if it meets the performance

requirements. To improve the availability of the NTP reference, at least two servers must

be configured. The NodeB implements the synchronization solution as the client node. This method is called Synchronization over IP (SoIP).

Figure 7   Network Overview of Network SoIP

If Iu interface is connected only over IP, no transmission interface is available through

which the RNC can be synchronized. In this case, the RNC must use a dedicated synchronization

reference, for example a 2048-kHz signal from a colocated SASE.

To meet performance requirements, the SoIP client sends an NTP request at regular intervals.

The regulator selects the NTP packet frequency based on its need. The higher request

frequency is used at startup or reference acquisition to make convergence time shorter. When

steady state is reached, the rate is decreased.

For the Baseband Radio Node, SoIP can also rely on the PTP protocol. In this case, a

standalone Grandmaster clock is used as the synchronization server, and the NodeB implements

the TimeReceiver clock on the client part.

Synchronous Ethernet is an alternative method for network

synchronization

which can be configured on

Baseband

Radio Node.

Synchronous Ethernet enables the use of Ethernet signals as frequency synchronization

references. Frequency information is extracted from the bit rate. Furthermore, the Ethernet

Synchronization Message Channel (ESMC) is introduced to add quality signaling in the

Synchronization Status Message (SSM). This is used by the radio node to ensure that the

quality of the synchronization reference meets the 3GPP radio requirement.

# 10 LTE and NR Aspects of Network Synchronization

In LTE and NR networks, frequency synchronization is a mandatory requirement. Phase

synchronization must be provided for TDD systems, and for FDD systems when the application

requires it. When the Baseband Radio Node is time and phase synchronized, it is also frequency

synchronized.

## 10.1 Frequency Synchronization in LTE and NR

LTE and NR operate over an Ethernet network. Depending on the backhaul capabilities, the

eNodeB or gNodeB can receive a frequency reference from NTP, PTP, or Synchronous Ethernet

sources. A source from GNSS receiver is also a valid option.

The frequency error requirements are ± 50 ppb over a period of 1 millisecond, as specified in

the 3GPP TS 36.104 standard.

The easiest and most common means of providing frequency synchronization in LTE is to deploy

a PTP Grandmaster. This uses the PTP protocol with the ITU-T G.8265.1 telecom

profile.

## 10.2 Phase Synchronization in LTE and NR

Frequency synchronization is mandatory to meet the 3GPP accuracy requirements of the air

interface. Phase synchronization can also be used to support TDD access and enable features,

such as Carrier Aggregation, running on FDD systems.

Usually, NR FDD systems have to be time and phase synchronized. When LTE FDD interacts with

NR Standalone or Non-Standalone, the LTE FDD has to be time and phase synchronized as well.

The less strict synchronization accuracy of 0.5 ms is applicable in these cases using Partial

Timing Support (PTS) with relaxed network limits. In addition, an assisting time reference can

be also configured for better robustness in time and phase synchronization. For more

information, see Manage Network Synchronization.

Solutions that enable phase synchronization between adjacent cells are GNSS and PTP. The

phase error requirement between two Antenna Reference Points (ARP) is 3 μs.

Baseband nodes have their own Basic Frame Number (BFN). Cells have System Frame Numbers (SFN)

that are related to the BFN.

Figure 8   Relationship between BFN and SFN

Without phase synchronization, the initialization time of the BFN is defined locally in the

baseband unit. The BFN offset, that is the BFN difference between two baseband units, can

drift. The SFN offset does not drift between two cells that are controlled by the same

baseband unit.

Figure 9   Time and Phase Synchronization in LTE

When the BFN is locked to an external time base, the value (set to 0) is aligned in time

between different baseband units,  and can drift only within a limited range. As a result, the

SFN initialization time for radio frame transmission is correlated to the external

synchronization reference.

# 11 Fronthaul Synchronization

The 3GPP synchronization requirements are defined at the Base Station antenna. This means

that the hardware unit where synchronization accuracy really counts is at the

radio

unit. The

distributed

unit,

in

the ERS case, the Baseband unit, must be synchronous with the

radio

unit for UE data scheduling to work properly. Only if the

synchronization distribution path passes the DU, the accuracy of the fronthaul interface

must be better than the 3GPP required accuracy at the antenna.

There are some special fronthaul deployments that require alternative synchronization

solutions.

This document gives an overview of these solutions. For more specific deployment

examples, see Network Synchronization Solution

Guideline.

## 11.1 Mixed Mode Radio and Multi-Operator RAN Aspect of Network Synchronization

For Managed Elements that share resources, the nodes must be synchronized with each

other.

The selection

of

the synchronization method depends on the type of

fronthaul used. Different methods are supported for

CPRI-connected

shared units and

eCPRI-connected

shared units.

For

CPRI-connected

shared units, Node Group Synchronization must be used.

This

method is described in Manage Node Group Synchronization, which also describes some

outdated methods for

CPRI-connected

shared units as a

reference.

Node Group Synchronization (NGS) is a synchronization architecture which must be used

when two nodes share

a

CPRI radio unit in Mixed Mode Radio or Multi-Operator RAN. For features that share radio

resources, the nodes must be synchronized to each other. Node Group Synchronization can

be used to achieve this synchronization.

Node Group Synchronization is supported by NR, LTE, WCDMA, CDMA, and GSM.

For

eCPRI-connected

units, the following different methods are supported:

- GNSS to both nodes
- PTP from backhaul to both nodes
- PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit

### 11.1.1 Node Group Synchronization

Two or more

Baseband

units can share radio resources (for features such as Mixed Mode Radio). To share radio

resources, they must be synchronized to each other within the Node Group. Each Node Group uses

only one external synchronization reference. The node that uses the external synchronization

reference is called the Synchronization Provider. The other nodes within the Node Group are

called Synchronization Receivers. The external references can be used as backup references,

when a Synchronization Receiver takes over the role of Synchronization Provider. All

Synchronization Receivers synchronize themselves to the Synchronization Provider, either

directly or by another Synchronization Receiver using Sync over CPRI Connections (SoCC).

Node Group Synchronization (NGS) must be included in the overall Network Synchronization

Plan.

The configuration details of the NGS function are provided in the Manage Node Group

Synchronization document.

### 11.1.2 Dynamic Node Group Synchronization

Dynamic Node Group Synchronization is an improvement of Node Group Synchronization that

introduces reference redundancy across the Node Group. It has an enhanced mode and a

reduced mode.

Enhanced Nodes

In enhanced nodes, a combination of node priority and reference priority is used to

appoint a node as the Synchronization Provider for the Group. This way, the node

with the best available external reference synchronizes the node group.

Enhanced nodes use the full set of information from neighbor nodes. Enhanced nodes

and reduced nodes communicate a more detailed ranking for external references than

pre-dynamic nodes.

In enhanced nodes, faults within the node group and faults of the external reference

cause the Synchronization Provider to change role. The Synchronization Receiver with

the highest rank becomes the new Synchronization Provider.

Reduced Nodes

In reduced nodes and Pre-Dynamic Node Group Synchronization, the rank contains only

the node priority configured by the operator. This means that role selection is not

dynamic. Node priority 1 defines the Synchronization Provider. The role selection

process does not consider the ranking of the external references. Reduced nodes use

the same ranking range as enhanced nodes in the transmission of the ranks of

external references.

For reduced nodes and pre-dynamic nodes, the synchronization path goes from higher

priority nodes to lower priority nodes. Only internal faults of the node group cause

the Synchronization Provider to change roles. Degradation of external references or

external faults does not cause the Synchronization Provider to change. When the

external reference of a Synchronization Provider is degraded in a reduced mode or

pre-dynamic mode, it still keeps the Synchronization Provider role.

The configuration details of the Dynamic Node Group Synchronization function are

provided in the Manage Node Group Synchronization document.

### 11.1.3 eCPRI Mixed Mode Synchronization

The eCPRI Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO feature shares radio resources between two

nodes, which requires that the nodes are synchronized.

For shared eCPRI radio units, such as AIR 6488, the phase synchronization between the

nodes is assured by time and phase synchronizing both nodes. Time and phase

synchronization are described in Manage Network Synchronization.

The eCPRI Mixed Mode Radio feature supports the following synchronization methods:

- GNSS to both nodes
- PTP from backhaul to both nodes
- PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit

Dual GNSS

With the Dual GNSS method, the phase synchronization between the nodes is assured by

time and phase synchronizing both nodes to GNSS. Time and phase synchronization is

described in Manage Network Synchronization.

In deployments with shared eCPRI radio units, the delays of the GNSS system must be

compensated by configuring the attributes that represent these delays. See GNSS Receiver System User Guide.

The radio unit automatically selects one of the RI (radio interface) ports to

synchronize the internal processing and AIR interface. Usually, the AIR unit is able

to switch between the ports without disturbing traffic on the radio.

Backhaul PTP Synchronization of Both Nodes

With the dual backhaul PTP method, the phase synchronization between the nodes is

assured by time and phase synchronizing both nodes to a common Cell Site Router

(CSR) directly connected to the Baseband units. The following solutions apply for

synchronization through CSR:

- The router takes time from backhaul using PTP.
- The router takes time from the GNSS connected to it or from PTP provided by a remote Grandmaster.

It is recommended to keep the differential accuracy between the ports at a minimum

for successful synchronization. To gain the best differential accuracy, locate the

common Boundary Clock only one hop away on both legs. However, the

PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute is set from the

accuracy delivered by the network from its Grandmaster.

PTP Fronthaul Time Synchronization through Shared Unit

PTP Fronthaul Time Synchronization over eCPRI ports through the shared unit provides

time alignment between two Baseband units sharing the same shared unit. One Baseband

unit with better-quality time reference provides synchronization to the shared unit,

while the other Baseband unit uses the synchronization over eCPRI port from the

shared unit to achieve the time alignment.

For more information, see chapter PTP Fronthaul Synchronization through the

Shared Unit in

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

## 11.2 eCPRI Fronthaul with Ethernet Switches

Ethernet switches in the eCPRI (Ethernet) fronthaul supports PTP Boundary Clock to

maintain the 3GPP accuracy requirements at the antenna. Each BC introduces an extra

synchronization accuracy error, which must be considered when planning the fronthaul.

Boundary Clocks also makes autonomous synchronization decisions outside the control of

the RAN.

This limits the feasible fronthaul network deployments in how many switches that can be

allowed, and how a stable synchronization solution must be set up. Such limitations are

described in the Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.
