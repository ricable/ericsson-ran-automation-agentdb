Hardware

Only mixed-mode-capable TDD AAS radios are

supported.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

In case of shared radio between two radio nodes, the carrier configuration must be

consistent.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

A mixed-mode capable AAS radio can be shared by two radio nodes, in configurations as

LTE + LTE, LTE + NR, or NR + NR.

The AasData.antSegmentation attribute is

applied to configure split-mode or mixed-mode radio configuration, with the following

values:

- If the attribute is set to WHOLE\_100 on both radio nodes, mixed mode radio configuration is applied.
- If the attribute is set to AUTO\_SPLIT on both radio nodes, split mode radio configuration is applied.
- If the attribute is set to AUTO on either of the radio nodes and the AAS hardware resources can handle the carrier demands, mixed mode radio is selected. Otherwise, split mode radio is selected.

## 3.1 NR Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO in Mixed-Mode Capable AAS radio

Figure 1 shows an example of an NR Mixed Mode

Radio for Massive MIMO configuration where two nodes have three sectors each in three

shared mixed-mode capable AAS radios.

# 6 Performance of NR Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

The NR Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO feature has no directly associated KPIs,

counters, or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Mixed Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

The default value of the EutranCellFDD.subFrameOffset parameter  can

be changed if phase shifting between two RATs is necessary. If the value is bigger than

1.5, the cell is disabled to prevent interference.

## 8.1 Reconfigure Split Mode Radio for Massive MIMO

When the radio networks used together with split mode are reconfigured, sector

carriers and cells must locked. When this includes switching from split mode to non-split

mode, a manual restart is necessary.

Steps

1. Lock all sector carriers and cells on the radio on both Radio Networks that share the radio.
2. Reconfigure one or both Radio Networks. Note: A manual radio restart is required when switching from split mode to non-split mode.
3. Unlock the sector carriers and cells on both Radio Networks.

Results

The new settings take effect after the sector carriers and cells are unlocked. In

case one of the DUs start late after the unlock, the radio might restart one

additional time to reallocate resources.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q4: Cold Baseband Restart Improvements

With this feature enhancement, the number of shared unit restarts caused by a

Baseband restart due to upgrade or a cold manual restart is reduced. When upgrading to an

older shared unit software, or when performing a manual cold restart when the shared unit

running software is newer, the number of restarts is zero. A shared unit is a Field

Replaceable Unit (FRU) that is connected to more than one external MEs.

Summary and Benefits

The cold Baseband restart improvement is applicable in the following cases:

- Integrating a Baseband unit with an FRU that is already integrated with another Baseband unit.
- Upgrading an ME with RAN software that includes software for shared FRU.
- Performing a manual cold restart of a Baseband unit.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- The time to enable a cell is reduced on the ME, resulting in less time with traffic loss.
- The external MEs do not experience traffic loss, since no shared FRU restart occurs.
- The external MEs take reduced time to enable a cell when a shared FRU restarts.

The benefits are more significant when the shared FRU is an AAS-capable radio unit,

because this type has longer startup time.
