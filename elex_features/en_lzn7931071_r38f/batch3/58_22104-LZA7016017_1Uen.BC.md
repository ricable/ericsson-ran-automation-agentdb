Summary

The NR Emergency Fallback to LTE feature enables the control of UE transition to an LTE

frequency. The neighboring LTE frequencies that are used can be prioritized.

This feature introduces the following emergency fallback methods:

- The service request-based fallback enables the UE to send a NAS Service Request to indicate an emergency call and request fallback. The 5GC orders the gNodeB to trigger fallback when it detects the emergency call and receives the request to fallback.
- The QoS-triggered emergency fallback enables the gNodeB to detect emergency calls and trigger fallback, when the 5GC supports emergency calls, but the gNodeB does not.

The NR Emergency Fallback to LTE feature supports the following mobility

actions:

- Blind RwR
- Measurement-based RwR
- IRAT handover

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The 5GC must support IRAT handover from NR to LTE.

The N26 interface is required for the NR Emergency Fallback to LTE feature.

The UE is required to support the following capabilities:

- Performing IRAT B1 measurements and send B1 measurement reports for RwR and IRAT handover.
- Performing IRAT handover from NR to LTE.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Emergency Fallback to LTE

The NR Emergency Fallback to LTE feature enables the gNodeB to support emergency

fallback.

Emergency fallback procedure is selected based on the following conditions:

- The configuration of the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute
- The Status of the NR Emergency Procedure feature
- UE capabilities

Depending on the configuration of the

McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute, the

following emergency fallback options can be performed:

- Blind RwR
- Measurement-based RwR
- Measurement-based IRAT handover

When the UE initiates an emergency call from RRC\_IDLE

state, blind RwR is performed regardless of the fallback configuration.

For more information about RwR and IRAT handover, see

NR Mobility.

Only redirection to LTE frequency with EPS system is supported. The redirection frequency

is chosen by the configured LTE frequency relation. The order of priority for the LTE

frequencies can be configured.

If emergency fallback is about to be performed, but no frequency is available, the UE is

released without redirection. The UE must perform an autonomous reselection to any RAT

that supports emergency calls.

Engineering Guidelines for NR Emergency Fallback to LTE

## 3.1 Emergency Call Detection

The NR Emergency Fallback to LTE feature enables the gNodeB to detect incoming

emergency calls, even if the UE does not send any indication of an emergency

call.

The gNodeB detects emergency calls in the following cases:

- The UE sends the RRCSetupRequest message to the gNodeB with the establishmentCause information element set to emergency. Note: If the establishmentCause information element is set to emergency, any voice session set up for the UE is treated as an emergency call, regardless of the 5QI and ARP values of the contained flows.
- If any established flows with 5QI = 5 have matching ARP values in the EmCall.arpPrioEm5qi5List attribute for the list of PLMNs in the EmCall.pLMNIdList attribute.
- If any incoming flows with 5QI = 1 have matching ARP values in the EmCall.arpPrioEm5qi1List attribute for the list of PLMNs in the EmCall.pLMNIdList attribute.
- If any incoming flows with 5QI = 5 have matching ARP values in the EmCall.arpPrioEm5qi5List attribute for the list of PLMNs in the EmCall.pLMNIdList attribute.

## 3.2 Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback

### 3.2.1 Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback with Blind RwR

Figure 2   Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback with Blind RwR

Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback with blind RwR is performed according to the

following procedure:

1. The UE sends a NAS SERVICE REQUEST message with the emergency services fallback value.
2. The NAS SERVICE REQUEST message is sent to the AMF in the NGAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE.
3. Emergency call is detected. The AMF instructs gNodeB to perform emergency fallback. The Emergency Fallback Indicator information element is included in the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message.
4. The gNodeB triggers the fallback procedure and performs blind RwR to an LTE frequency.
5. The gNodeB selects the LTE target frequency as follows: All LTE frequency relations containing LTE frequencies set in the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtranFallbackPrioEc are used as input. If AMF sent an MRL to the UE, any LTE frequencies that do not belong to the allowed PLMN (or to an equivalent PLMN) are removed. The gNodeB checks UE capabilities and UE RAT restrictions to remove unsupported LTE frequencies. Among the remaining LTE frequencies, the one with the highest priority set in the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtranFallbackPrioEc attribute is selected. If two or more frequencies have the same priority, the one with the lowest EARFCN value is chosen.
6. The gNodeB sends the RRCRelease to the UE and includes the selected LTE target frequency.
7. The gNodeB starts the UE Context Release Procedure.

### 3.2.2 Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback with Measurement-Based RwR

Measurement-based RwR can be performed if the UE is in

connected mode.

Figure 3   Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback with Measurement-Based RwR

Service Request-Based Emergency Fallback with measurement-based RwR is performed

according to the following procedure:

1. The UE sends a NAS Service Request message with the emergency services fallback value to the gNodeB.
2. The gNodeB sends the NAS Service Request message to the AMF in the NGAP UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message.
3. Emergency call is detected. The AMF instructs the gNodeB to perform emergency fallback. The Emergency Fallback Indicator information element is included in the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message.
4. The gNodeB selects the LTE target frequency as follows: All LTE frequency relations containing LTE frequencies set in the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtranFallbackPrioEc are used as input. If AMF sent an MRL to the UE, any LTE frequencies that do not belong to the allowed PLMN (or to an equivalent PLMN) are removed. The gNodeB checks UE capabilities and UE RAT restrictions to remove unsupported LTE frequencies. Among the remaining LTE frequencies, the one with the highest priority set in the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtranFallbackPrioEc attribute is selected. If two or more frequencies have the same priority, the one with the lowest EARFCN value is chosen.
5. The gNodeB configures the UE to perform B1 measurements on the configured LTE frequencies.

### 3.3.4 QoS-Triggered Emergency Fallback with Fallback Handling at Session Setup Activated

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, EPS Fallback can be

triggered at session setup.

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, the NR Emergency Fallback

to LTE feature involves the PDU Session Resource Setup and Initial Context Setup

procedures besides the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure.

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, one of the following

messages can trigger an emergency fallback for a UE:

- NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST with included 5QI=1 flow
- NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST with included 5QI=1 flow

For more information on the activation of the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature,

see Fallback Handling at Session Setup.

When the AMF instructs the gNodeB to establish a PDU session that includes the 5QI=1

flow, the QoS-Triggered Emergency Fallback procedure proceeds as follows:

1. The gNodeB checks if the PDU session is requested for an emergency call.
    - The gNodeB checks if the establishment cause is emergency.
    - The gNodeB checks if the ARP values of the 5QI = 5 or 5QI = 1 flows match the ARP values that are configured to be used for emergency.
2. If an emergency call is detected, the gNodeB triggers fallback.
3. The gNodeB sends the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE or the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message to the 5GC with the cause IMS voice EPS fallback or RAT fallback triggered.
4. The gNodeB selects the E-UTRA target frequency.
5. The gNodeB sends an RRC RRCRelease message to the UE and includes the selected E-UTRA target frequency.
6. The gNodeB initiates UE Context Release procedure.

## 3.4 EPS Fallback Prioritization Over Xn Handover Preparation

To prioritize EPS fallback for emergency calls, certain conditions need to be

fulfilled.

It is possible to configure the gNodeB to prioritize EPS fallback for emergency calls

over Xn handover preparation by setting the

McfbCellProfile.epsFallbackPrioritization attribute to

PRIO\_OVER\_XN\_HO.

If a PDU Session Resource Modify Request message to add QoS flow with 5QI = 1 is received

during preparation for Xn handover and if all conditions are fulfilled, the handover is

canceled and EPS fallback by blind release with redirect is performed.

EPS fallback for emergency voice services is only attempted if one of the following

conditions is fulfilled:

- The possibility of an EPS fallback is indicated in the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE received from the core network.
- The Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE is not indicated from the core network and the Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible attribute is set to true.

EPS fallback for emergency calls is prioritized over the Xn handover, if conditions for

EPS fallback are fulfilled and one of the following conditions is also fulfilled:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute is set to one of the following values: FORCED FORCED\_MEAS\_RWR FORCED\_MEAS\_IRAT\_HO
- The UE is not VoNR capable or the NR Emergency Procedures feature is not activated and the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute is set to one of the following values: ACTIVE ACTIVE\_MEAS\_RWR ACTIVE\_MEAS\_IRAT\_HO

## 3.6 Supported Measurement Gap Patterns for EPS Fallback

The gap pattern used for EPS fallback measurements is determined by the measurement

gap lengths that apply to the measurement.

Table 3   Supported Gap Patterns for EPS Fallback Measurements

|   Gap Pattern ID | Measurement Gap Length   | Measurement Gap Repetition Period   | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                0 | 6 ms                     | 40 ms                               | This measurement gap pattern is used for EPS fallback measurements if                                 the conditions for a 3-ms measurement gap length are not met. |
|                2 | 3 ms                     | 40 ms                               | This measurement gap pattern is used for EPS fallback measurements if                                 the conditions for a 3-ms measurement gap length are met.     |

Measurements use a 3 ms measurement gap if the following

conditions are all met:

- The GNBDUFunction.measGapLengthMode attribute is set to a value that enables a 3 ms measurement gap for the measurement.
- The UE indicates support for 3 ms measurement gaps in the supportedGapPattern UE capability.
- The placement of the 3 ms measurement gap length allows the UE to measure LTE synchronization signals.
- The SFN of the source cell must be aligned with the SFN of the target cells. Note: If the SFN of the source cell and the SFN of the target cells are not aligned, the GNBDUFunction.measGapLengthMode attribute is recommended to be set to one of the following values: NR\_FR1\_3MS OFF

If the measurement cannot be configured with a 3 ms measurement gap

length, a measurement gap pattern that has a 6 ms measurement gap length is

used instead. The measurement gap repetition period of the measurement is

not affected by this change.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## 7.1 Verify NR Emergency Fallback to LTE Activation

The counter NRCellCU.pmRwrEutranUeSuccEpsfbEmFbInd is stepped when

a Release-with-Redirect procedure is performed because of an Emergency Fallback

Indicator received from the AMF.

Steps

1. Check that the counter NRCellCU.pmRwrEutranUeSuccEpsfbEmFbInd shows a number of triggered emergency calls per cell.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Emergency Fallback to LTE

The

attributes

of this feature can be configured to optimize UE mobility to LTE.

Bad Configuration of E-UTRA Target Frequencies

The value of the NRCellCU.pmRwrEutranUeNonPerfEpsfbEm PM counter

is stepped when an emergency fallback is about to be performed, but no LTE carrier

is available. In a good configuration, the value of the PM counter is zero.

If the NRCellCU.pmRwrEutranUeNonPerfEpsfbEm PM counter has a

non-zero value, the configuration of E-UTRA frequencies to redirect to must be

reconsidered.

Configuration of McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm Attribute

To select the mobility procedure

that

is used for emergency fallback, the

McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperationEm attribute can be

configured with the following options:
