Summary

The Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart feature is now enabled by default

and does not need to be manually activated.

For upgrade cases where the software delta is limited to LTE, NR, or radio unit, and

there is no MOM change, the feature brings the following benefits:

- Shorter service downtime thanks to the shorter restart time
- Reduced upgrade time
- In multistandard radio, only the upgraded RAT is restarted
- When upgrading the radio, there is no need to restart Baseband, however all cells on the radio are restarted.

# 2 Dependencies of Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart

Features

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No special  hardware requirements.

Limitations

The program group restart on LTE has impact NR for users with ESS configuration

since both NR and LTE users share the same carriers. The same principle is also

applicable when NR SW is restarted for user with ESS configuration.

Network Requirements

No special network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart

The feature introduces a new software upgrade method, for upgrades with no MOM changes,

based only on the delta software.

Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart enables the new upgrade concept, to reduce

and minimize the end user and the In-Service Performance impact when the software delta

is limited to LTE, NR, and radio unit, and does not contain any MOM changes.

The Adaptive Restart is represented and controlled by the following attributes in the

MOM:

- UpgradePackage.UpgradeRestartType indicates whether an Upgrade Package (UP) is compatible with adaptive restart. The attribute is read-only and cannot be modified manually.
- UpgradePackage.RestartType is an optional attribute, which can be set by the user at upgrade, to determine the restart logic as follows: If the COLD setting is selected, a system cold restart at upgrade is executed, regardless of the UP capability. If the ADAPTIVE setting is selected, the system checks the UP and selects the optimal restart based on UP delta. If no value is provided, the ADAPTIVE setting is used by default.

For LTE and NR, it means that only the LTE or NR software is upgraded and restarted, the

rest of system is not affected. Similarly for the radio unit, only the radio unit

software is upgraded and restarted, without affecting the Baseband.

The Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart feature enhancement supports

multistandard configurations with LTE and GSM.

# 7 Activate Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart

Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart is a basic feature. It does not require

manual activation.

# 8 Deactivate Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart

Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart is a basic feature. It can be disabled

if necessary.

Do the following to disable the feature:

Steps

1. During SW upgrade procedure continue with COLD flag in MO UP activate action. For more information, see Manage Software.

Example 1   UP activate HARD COLD

Summary and Benefits

Uplift of NR and LTE applications is now possible including any configurational

changes in the managed object model. Previously, adaptive restart was not possible

when the managed object model was changed in any way. This improvements enables an

adaptive restart when the managed object model is changed.

The EMGUI application will be restarted during application upgrade.

Downtime during upgrade is now shorter.

Capacity and Performance

Improved user capacity because of the shorter downtime during upgrade.
