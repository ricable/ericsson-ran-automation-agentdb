# 1 UE Grouping Framework Introduction

The UE Grouping Framework introduces a solution to handle the demand for the

differentiation of services, functions, and feature behavior.

|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5314                           |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                           |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                    |
| Access Type            | NR                                     |
| Licensing              | Basic feature. No license is required. |

The UE Grouping Framework introduces functions that provide a solution for the following

needs:

- Differentiated UE handling for different groups of UEs.
- A/B-testing in live network environments.
- Gradual introduction and testing of new features and functions in live network environments, and simultaneous performance comparison between the new and existing features and functions.
- Hard UE limitation handling.

The UE Grouping Framework introduces the following functions:

- UE Group Definition
- UE Group Evaluation
- Algorithm for Selection of MO Class Instances Based on UE Groups

Observability related to the different UE groups provided by the UE Group Framework is

provided by the Event Framework and the Flexible Counter Framework. RAN features that

support and use the UE Group Framework must be adapted and follow certain rules

associated with the UE Group Framework.

The UE Grouping Framework supports the following group types:

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

If the PDU Session Resource Setup or the PDU Session QoS modification procedures are

only partially successful, the UE group ID reevaluation and redistribution processes

are not supported in the gNodeB from the beginning of the PDU session. For example,

if the PDU Session Setup intends to set up two new 5QI flows, the UE group

evaluation is made based on the successful setup of both 5QI flows. Even if the

setup fails for one of the 5QI flows, the UE group evaluation is based on the

assumption that both 5QI flows are successfully set up.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.2 or later is required.

# 3 UE Grouping Framework Operation

The UE Grouping Framework includes the following processes:

- UE group definition
- UE group evaluation
- Algorithm for selecting MO class instances based on UE groups
- Observability for each UE group

## 3.1 UE Group Definition

The UE Grouping Framework feature configures UE groups based on dedicated MO

classes.

Each group type is configured based on dedicated MO classes.

(1)

The UE Configuration Group Type does not have a

corresponding MO class. Instead, the class is determined

by the value of the attribute ueConfGroupType, which is

set to either UE\_MOBILITY\_GROUP, UE\_SERVICE\_GROUP or

UE\_ADMISSION\_GROUP.

(4)

for the UE Admission Group Type

The group instances of the respective group type are defined by the following

attributes:

- Group identifier
- Selection criteria
- Priority
- Selection probability, only for UE Group Type
- IMEISV list reference
- Chipset identifier list reference

Group Identifier

Group identifiers must be unique among groups of the same UE group type. The

identifier value ranges from 1 to 255. The following attributes can be used to

configure group identifiers:

- PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.prefUeGroupId
- UeAdmissionGroupDefinition.ueAdmissionGroupId
- UeGroupSelectionProfile.ueGroupId
- UeMobilityGroupDefinition.ueMobilityGroupId
- UeServiceGroupDefinition.ueServiceGroupId

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria that a UE must fulfill to match the specific group instance.

The selection criteria definition is based on the following UE variables:

- 5QI or QCI
- ARP
- Cell Group Role Note: UEs can belong to a Master Cell Group, or a Secondary Cell Group.
- Chipset identifier
- IMEI-SVN
- IMEI-TAC
- Masked IMEISV
- Paging priority
- PLMN
- RedCap UE
- RFSP or SPID
- RRC establishmentCause or RRC resumeCause information element
- S-NSSAI
- Low-Band and Mid-Band VoNR capability

The following attributes can be used to configure selection criteria:

- UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria
- PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria
- UeMobilityGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria
- UeServiceGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria
- UeAdmissionGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria

The selection criteria have a defined syntax. For details, see the relevant

selectionCriteria attribute description.

The UE group evaluation algorithm follows semantic rules related to the selection

criteria. For details, see the relevant selectionCriteria

attribute description.

Priority

A relative priority between groups of the same UE group type. The priority value must

be unique among groups of the same UE group type. The priority value ranges from 1

to 65535. If a UE fulfills the selection criteria for several groups of the same UE

group type, the instance with the highest priority is selected for the UE.

The following attributes can be used to set priority:

- UeGroupSelectionProfile.ueGroupPriority
- PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.prefUeGroupPriority
- UeMobilityGroupDefinition.ueMobilityGroupPriority
- UeAdmissionGroupDefinition.ueAdmissionGroupPriority
- UeServiceGroupDefinition.ueServiceGroupPriority

Selection Probability

Probability for UEs to be selected into a group instance after fulfilling the

selection criteria of said group instance. The

UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionProbability attribute is

only available for the UE group type.

IMEISV List Reference

UEs can be grouped based on IMEISV information. There are two options to define the

IMEISV values that the masked IMEISV values of the UEs are matched against.

Selection criteria can be based on IMEISV values or on a list of IMEISV value

ranges.

The following attributes are used in the UE configuration selection process:

- PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.imeiSvRef
- UeAdmissionGroupDefinition.imeiSvRef
- UeGroupSelectionProfile.imeiSvRef
- UeMobilityGroupDefinition.imeiSvRef
- UeServiceGroupDefinition.imeiSvRef

Chipset Identifier List Reference

UEs can be grouped based on chipset information. The chipset identifier list refers

to a chipsetRef MO instance that defines a list of chipset

identifiers that the UE and its chipset identifier are matched against. Selection

criteria can be based on chipset identifier value or on a list of chipset identifier

value ranges.

The UE must support chipset identifier signaling to use selection criteria based on

chipset identifier. The following dummy IEs in the

UECapabilityInformation RRC message are used for chipset

identifier signaling:

- The optional mac-ParametersCommon.dummy IE indicates if the UE supports chipset identifier reporting.
- The optional mimo-ParametersPerBand.dummy4 IE contained in the first BandNR instance in the supportedBandListNR IE contains the chipset identifier.

The following attributes are used in the chipset identifier configuration process:

- PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile.chipsetRef
- UeAdmissionGroupDefinition.chipsetRef
- UeGroupSelectionProfile.chipsetRef
- UeMobilityGroupDefinition.chipsetRef
- UeServiceGroupDefinition.chipsetRef

The gNodeB can be configured to send the network identifier to the UE. The network

identifier contains the vendor identity and the gNodeB software version

information.

If the GNBCUCPFunction.networkIdInUeCapEnq attribute is set to

true, the information is included in the RRC

UECapabilityEnquiry message sent to the UE. The UE can modify

capabilities based on the information included in the RRC

UECapabilityEnquiry message, and send chipset information to the gNodeB

based on the received network identifier.

## 3.2 UE Group Evaluation

The UE group evaluation process assigns the UE one of the defined group instances of

the different group types.

### 3.2.1 UE Group Evaluation Triggering Points

The UE group evaluation process is triggered for UEs in RRC connected mode at predefined

triggering points. The triggering points represent changes of the NR resources used by a

UE, such as the following procedures:

- Setup, modification, or release of services
- Mobility events

Table 3   Messages That Can Trigger UE Group Evaluation

### 3.2.2 UE Variables

The UE group evaluation process uses UE-related parameters, which are referred to as

UE variables in this document.

The following UE variables are provided by either the 5GC network, the LTE network, or

the UE depending on whether the UE runs NR standalone or EN-DC, and the validity of the

corresponding variable differs slightly in the two deployments:

- 5QI in NR standalone or QCI in EN-DC
- ARP
- Cell Group Role Note: UEs can belong to a Master Cell Group or a Secondary Cell Group. The Cell Group Role is determined based on the UE context. For EN-DC, the Cell Group Role is always Secondary Group Role. For NR standalone, the Cell Group Role can be Master Cell Group or Secondary Cell Group.
- Chipset identifier
- IMEI-SVN
- IMEI-TAC
- Masked IMEISV
- Paging priority
- PLMN
- RedCap UE in NR standalone
- RFSP in NR standalone or SPID in EN-DC
- S-NSSAI in NR standalone
- The RRC establishmentCause or RRC resumeCause information elementNote: Only applicable when performing UE group evaluation in the NR standalone Master Node.
- Low-Band and Mid-Band VoNR capability Only applicable when performing UE group evaluation in the NR standalone Master Node.

### 3.2.3 Algorithm

The UE group evaluation process uses UE variables as input data and evaluates them

towards the defined selection criteria of the group instances of all group

types.

A UE fulfills the selection criteria of a group instance if the evaluation result is

true. If the evaluation result is false or

unknown, the UE does not belong to the group instance.

The UE group evaluation algorithm follows semantic rules related to the selection

criteria. Special semantic rules apply to selection criteria, including UE variables

related to the following flows:

| NR standalone flow   |    | 5QI, ARP, S-NSSAI   |
|----------------------|----|---------------------|
|                      |    |                     |
| EN-DC flow           |    | QCI, ARP            |

Selection criteria evaluation is applicable to all variables or a combination of them. If

a UE does not have a flow, variable values that are flow-dependent are evaluated as

unknown. If there is a need for selection criteria to match the

combination of flow-dependent variables, flow expression can be used.

Flow expression evaluation is performed for each QoS flow, independent of other

expression lists. Up to four flow expressions can be defined in the

selectionCriteria

attribute under the relevant MO classes. The outcomes of each match made for each flow

and flow expression are stored.

The selection criteria evaluates to true if the combined results from

the multiple expressions and flow expressions evaluate to true.

For details, see the MOM description of the selectionCriteria

attribute under the relevant MO classes and Examples of How the UE Grouping

Framework Can Be Applied in the UE Grouping Framework document.

A UE can only belong to a single group instance of each group type. This is ensured by

the precondition that all group instances of each group type must be configured with a

unique priority value, and that the evaluation is performed in priority order. If the UE

fulfills the selection criteria of more than one group instance, the group instance with

the highest relative priority is chosen for the UE.

For the UE group type, the selection criteria matching is complemented with an extra

selection probability condition. A UE group type instance is only chosen if both the

selection criteria and the selection probability condition are fulfilled.

As a result of the UE group evaluation process, the UE is assigned the group identity

value of the chosen group instance of all group types.

If the UE does not fulfill any of the selection criteria of any of the group instances

for a group type, or if there are no operator-defined group instances for the group

type, the UE is assigned to the Default group of the group type.

## 3.3 Algorithm for Selection of MO Class Instances Based on UE Groups

Features or functions adapted to the UE Grouping Framework support the differentiated

selection of configuration data depending on which group instances the UE belongs

to.

MO classes that provide configuration data to a feature that is adapted to the UE

Grouping Framework are characterized by the following properties:

- The MO class name ends with UeCfg. Such MO classes are referred to as UeCfg MO.
- The cardinality of the MO class is larger than 1.
- The system automatically creates an instance with RDN=Base, unless an operator does so manually. Note: There are exceptions to this rule, for example in the gNodeB-DU.
- The MO class includes three group list attributes that specify which groups of the respective group type an MO class instance supports. The following attributes are available: prefUeGroupList The prefUeGroupList attribute contains a list of group identifiers that belong to the Preference UE Group Type. ueGroupList The ueGroupList attribute contains a list of group identifiers that belong to the UE Group Type, that is a reference to the UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class. ueConfGroupList The ueConfGroupList attribute contains a list of identifiers that belong to the UE Configuration Group Type, which can be one of the following: The UE Mobility Group Type, that is a reference to the UeMobilityGroupDefinition MO class. The UE Service Group Type, that is a reference to the UeServiceGroupDefinition MO class. The UE Admission Group Type, that is a reference to the UeAdmissionGroupDefinition MO class. Configuration Group Type is chosen for a UeCfg MO class based on the confGroupType attribute in the parent MO class of the UeCfg MO class.

The UE Grouping Framework includes a support function that selects

UeCfg MO class instances for a specific UE depending on the

following factors:

- Which group of the respective UE Group Types the UE belongs to.
- Which groups of the respective group type the different UeCfg MO instances are defined to support based on the three group list attributes.

The selection algorithm consists of a set of predefined matching rules executed in a

predefined order. The order reflects the defined precedence among the different group

types. A match for the Preference UE Group Type takes precedence over a match for the UE

Group Type, which in turn takes precedence over a match for the UE Configuration Group

Type.

An empty group list attribute is defined to match all UEs regardless of which group the

UE belongs to.

The matching rules are executed in the following order, and the UeCfg

MO class instance that first matches a rule is chosen:

1. Select the UeCfg MO class instance that explicitly matches both the Preference UE Group identifier and the UE Group identifier of the UE.
2. Select the UeCfg MO class instance that explicitly matches the Preference UE Group identifier of the UE, and for which the ueGroupList attribute is empty.
3. Select the UeCfg MO class instance that explicitly matches the UE Group identifier of the UE and for which the prefUeGroupList attribute is empty.
4. Select the UeCfg MO class instance that explicitly matches the UE Configuration Group identifier of the UE.
5. Select UeCfg MO class instance with RDN=Base.

In the UeCfg MO class instance with RDN=Base, all

three group list attributes must be empty. Therefore, a UE is matched to this instance

if it does not explicitly match any of the other UeCfg MO

class             instances.

To ensure that the matching rules result in a clear outcome, consistency checks are

performed when the values of the three group list attributes are configured during the

following procedures:

- A new UeCfg MO class instance is created.
- The configuration of an existing UeCfg MO instance is updated.
- An existing UeCfg MO instance is deleted.

The group list attribute configurations are only accepted if all the following

configuration rules are fulfilled after the configuration changes:

1. The combination of a preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute and a UE group identifier in the ueGroupList attribute must be unique among UeCfg MO instances under the same parent MO instance. This rule ensures a consistent configuration if A/B-testing is done for UEs that belong to specific preference UE groups.
2. For all preference UE group identifiers defined in the prefUeGroupList attribute among all UeCfg MO instances under the same parent MO instance, exactly one UeCfg MO instance must exist in which a given preference UE group identifier in the prefUeGroupList attribute is combined with an empty ueGroupList attribute. This rule ensures that there is one UeCfg MO instance available that matches a specific preference UE group if this specific preference UE group is used in relation to this UeCfg MO class. As soon as a UeCfg MO instance is created with a non-empty prefUeGroupList and a non-empty ueGroupList attribute, all the preference UE group identifiers in the prefUeGroupList must at the same time be available in another UeCfg MO instance and its prefUeGroupList attribute in combination with an empty ueGroupList attribute.
3. The combination of a given UE group identifier in the ueGroupList attribute and an empty prefUeGroupList attribute must be unique among UeCfg MO instances under the same parent MO instance.
4. A given UE configuration group identifier can be defined in only one ueConfGroupList attribute among the UeCfg MO instances under the same parent MO instance.
5. The following attributes must be empty in the McpcPCellProfileUeCfg=Base MO instance, but they cannot all be empty in other UeCfg MO instances under the same parent McpcPCellProfile MO: prefUeGroupList ueGroupList ueConfGroupList

If the UE group adaptation of a feature or a function is license controlled, the

following behavior is applied:

- If the feature license is deactivated, the UeCfg MO instance with RDN=Base is selected.
- If the feature license is activated, the UeCfg MO instance is selected based on which UE groups the UE belongs to.

## 3.4 Feature Observability on UE Group Level

Operators can monitor the performance for a UE group-adapted feature on UE group

level. The legacy KPI formulas can be filtered on UE group level.

Observability for UE group-adapted features is supported through the EBS-N flexible

counters with support for filter attributes for the different UE group types:

- Preference UE group type
- UE group type
- UE mobility group type
- UE service group type
- UE admission group type

This means that operators can monitor the performance of a feature for groups of each UE

group type, using the legacy KPI formulas.

It is important to explicitly define which EBS counters to use on specific nodes for

specific UE groups for good observability.

For more information on flexible counter configuration, see Manage Performance and Flexible Counter Management in the ENM

Online Help library.

## 3.5 Examples of How the UE Grouping Framework Can Be Applied

### 3.5.1 A/B-Testing

The UE Grouping Framework provides a method for A/B-testing. With help of the UE

Group Type, different configurations can be tested simultaneously.

Instead of testing one configuration at a time, several configurations can be applied

simultaneously. This reduces the total time it takes to test and compare different

configurations, while ensuring that the different configurations are applied under the

same conditions.

#### 3.5.1.1 Use A/B-Testing to Compare a Standard Setting with One Alternative Configuration

In this example, the standard setting is represented by a fictive MO class named

MyClassUeCfg and its Base

instance.

```
MyClassUeCfg with RDN = Base:
- attribute 1 = 10
- attribute 2 = 20
- prefUeGroupList  = empty
- ueGroupList = empty
- ueConfigGroupList = empty
```

In the beginning, the system does not have any explicit groups defined for any of the

group types. This means that all UEs by default belong to the

Default group of their respective group types. The system

applies the same configuration to all UEs based on the settings defined by the

Base instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO

class.

Prerequisites

In this example, it is assumed that the operator wants to perform A/B-testing with an

alternative configuration, which is applied to 50% of the UEs. The other 50% of the

UEs use the standard setting.

Steps

1. Define a UE Group Type instance that randomly selects 50% of UEs. Example UeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ABTesting50 - selectionCriteria = empty - selectionProbability = 50% - ueGroupId = 1 - ueGroupPriority = 1 The empty UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria attribute means that all UEs match. Setting the UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 50% causes the system to randomly select 50% of UEs that match the selection criteria.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Add the alternative configuration of the MyClassUeCfg MO class. Example MyClassUeCfg with RDN = AlternativeConfiguration - attribute 1 = 110 - attribute 2 = 120 - prefUeGroupList = empty - ueGroupList = 1 - ueConfigGroupList = empty Setting the MyClassUeCfg.ueGroupList attribute to 1 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the UE group with the identifier value of 1.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The UE group evaluation process randomly selects 50% of the UEs to belong to the

ABTesting50  instance of the

UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class. These UEs are assigned to

the UE Group Type with the identifier value of 1. The rest of the

UEs that match the selection criteria, but are not selected by the selection

probability criteria, belong to the Default group for the UE

Group Type.

When the system selects which instance of MyClassUeCfg to apply for a

specific UE, the UeCfg selection algorithm has the following

possible outcomes:

- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined ABTesting50 instance of the UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class are matched to the AlternativeConfiguration instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the Default group are matched to the Base instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO class.

#### 3.5.1.2 Use A/B-Testing to Compare a Standard Setting with Two Alternative Configurations

In this example, the standard setting is represented by a fictive MO class named

MyClassUeCfg and its Base

instance.

```
MyClassUeCfg with RDN = Base:
- attribute 1 = 10
- attribute 2 = 20
- prefUeGroupList = empty
- ueGroupList = empty
- ueConfigGroupList = empty
```

In the beginning, the system does not have any explicit groups defined for any of the

group types. This means that all UEs belong to the Default

group of their respective group types by default. With these conditions fulfilled,

the system applies the same configuration to all UEs based on the settings defined

by the Base instance of the MyClassUeCfg

MO class.

Prerequisites

In this example, the following assumptions are made:

- The operator wants to perform A/B-testing with two alternative configurations.
- Each of the alternative configurations is applied to one third of the UEs.
- The last third of the UEs use the standard setting.

Steps

1. Define a UE Group Type instance that randomly selects 33% of the total population of UEs. Example UeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ABTesting33 - selectionCriteria = empty - selectionProbability = 33% - ueGroupId = 2 - ueGroupPriority = 2 The empty UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria attribute implies that all UEs match. Setting the UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 33% causes the system to randomly select 33% of UEs that match the selection criteria.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Define a second UE Group Type instance that randomly selects 50% of the total population of UEs. Example UeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ABTesting50 - selectionCriteria = empty - selectionProbability = 50% - ueGroupId = 1 - ueGroupPriority = 1 Setting the UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 50% causes the system to randomly select 50% of UEs that match the selection criteria.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)
5. Add the alternative configurations of the MyClassUeCfg MO class. Example MyClassUeCfg with RDN = AlternativeConfiguration1: - attribute 1 = 110 - attribute 2 = 120 - prefUeGroupList = empty - ueGroupList = 1 - ueConfigGroupList = empty MyClassUeCfg with RDN = AlternativeConfiguration2: - attribute 1 = 210 - attribute 2 = 220 - prefUeGroupList = empty - ueGroupList = 2 - ueConfigGroupList = empty Setting the MyClassUeCfg.ueGroupList attribute to 1 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the UE group with the identifier value 1. Setting the MyClassUeCfg.ueGroupList attribute to 2 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the UE group with the identifier value 2.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The UE group evaluation process randomly selects 33% of the UEs and assigns them to the

ABTesting33 instance of the

UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class. These UEs are assigned the

UE Group Type identifier value of 2.

The process then randomly selects another 33.5% of the UEs and assigns them to the

ABTesting50 instance of the

UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class. These UEs are assigned the

UE Group Type identifier value of 1. Only 33% of UEs is assigned to

this MO instance, because this instance has a lower priority than

ABTesting33. Because of this, 33% of the total UE

population is already assigned to ABTesting33, meaning that 50%

of the remaining UE population is 33.5%.

The rest of the UEs that match the selection criteria but do not match the selection probability

criterion of either the ABTesting33 or the

ABTesting50 MO instance belong to the

Default group for the UE Group Type by default. In this

example, 33.5% of the UEs are added to the Default group.

When the system selects which instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO to apply to a

specific UE, the UeCfg selection algorithm has the following

possible outcomes:

- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined ABTesting33 instance of the UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class are matched to the AlternativeConfiguration2 instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined ABTesting50 instance of the UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class are matched to the AlternativeConfiguration1 instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the Default group are matched to the Base instance of the MyClassUeCfg MO class.

### 3.5.2 Gradual Introduction of Features

When using the UE Grouping Framework, new features can be gradually introduced in a

live network to test the new features on a limited number of UEs.

#### 3.5.2.1 Introduce a New Feature to a Live Network

In this scenario, a fictive feature called MyFeature is used to illustrate the

concept.

```
MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = Base:
- enabled = false (default value = false)
- attribute 1 = 10
- attribute 2 = 20
- prefUeGroupList = empty
- ueGroupList = empty
- ueConfigGroupList = empty
```

This scenario is based on the following assumptions:

- All configuration data used by MyFeature is found in the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- The MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class includes an enabled attribute, which controls whether the feature is enabled.

In the beginning, the system does not have any explicit groups defined for any of the

group types. This implies that all UEs belong to the Default group of their

respective group types by default. With these conditions fulfilled, the system

applies the same configuration to all UEs based on the settings defined by the

Base instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg

MO class. The standard setting implies that MyFeature is disabled for all UEs by

default.

Prerequisites

In this scenario, the feature is activated for a limited number of UEs, to be tested

on a smaller scale. In this example, the feature is activated for 10% of the UEs,

while for 90% of the UEs, the feature is deactivated.

Steps

1. Define a UE Group Type instance that randomly selects 10% of UEs. Example UeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = TestMyFeature10 - selectionCriteria = empty - selectionProbability = 10% - ueGroupId = 1 - ueGroupPriority = 1 The empty UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionCriteria attribute implies that all UEs match. Setting the UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 10% causes the system to randomly select 10% of UEs that match the selection criteria.

3. Add a second instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class with the feature enabled. Example MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = MyFeatureTestConfiguration: - enabled = true - attribute 1 = 10 - attribute 2 = 20 - prefUeGroupList = empty - ueGroupList = 1 - ueConfigGroupList = empty Setting the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg.ueGroupList attribute to 1 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the UE group with the identifier value of 1.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The UE group evaluation process randomly selects 10% of the UEs to belong to the

TestMyFeature10 instance of the

UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class. These UEs are assigned UE

Group Type identifier 1. The rest of the UEs that match the

selection criteria, but are not selected by the

UeGroupSelectionProfile.selectionProbability criterion,

belong to the Default group for the UE Group Type by

default.

When the system selects which instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg

MO class to apply to a specific UE, the UeCfg selection

algorithm has the following possible outcomes:

- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined TestMyFeature10 instance of the UeGroupSelectionProfile MO class are matched to the MyFeatureTestConfiguration instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the Default group are matched to the Base instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.

As a result, MyFeature is enabled for 10% of the UEs.

### 3.5.3 Differentiated Configuration

When using the UE Grouping Framework, it is possible to apply different configurations

for features, depending on which UE groups a UE belongs to.

#### 3.5.3.1 Create a Differentiated Configuration for a Feature

In this scenario, a fictive feature MyFeature has a standard setting represented by a

fictive MO class named MyFeatureCtrUeCfg and its

Base instance.

```
MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = Base:
- enabled = true
- attribute 1 = 10
- attribute 2 = 20
- prefUeGroupList = empty
- ueGroupList = empty
- ueConfigGroupList = empty
```

This scenario is based on the following assumptions:

- All configuration data used by MyFeature is found in the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- The MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class includes an enabled attribute, which controls whether the feature is enabled.
- MyFeature is activated for all UEs regardless of which UE groups they belong to.
- The aim is to treat UEs that belong to different groups differently on a more permanent basis. In this case, the operator does not want MyFeature to be activated for UEs with an active voice session.

The system begins without any explicit groups defined for any of the group types.

This implies that all UEs belong to the Default group of their

respective group types by default. With these conditions fulfilled, the system

applies the same configuration to all UEs based on the settings defined by the

Base instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg

MO class.

Steps

1. Define a UE Service Group Type instance that includes all UEs with voice sessions. In this case, the UE Service Group Type is used, as this is a more permanent differentiation based on service use. Example UeServiceGroupDefinition with RDN = VoiceGroup - selectionCriteria = "5qi == 1" - ueServiceGroupId = 1 - ueServiceGroupPriority = 1 The UeServiceGroupDefinition.selectionCriteria attribute value 5qi == 1 is used to define UEs with voice sessions.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Define which UE Configuration Group Type to use in the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class. This is done by setting the attribute ueConfGroupType to UE\_SERVICE\_GROUP in the parent MO class of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO.
4. Add a second instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class with the feature disabled. Example MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = VoiceGroup: - enabled = false - attribute 1 = 10 - attribute 2 = 20 - prefUeGroupList = empty - ueGroupList = empty - ueConfigGroupList = 1 Setting the value of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg.ueGroupList attribute to 1 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the UE Service Group with the identifier value 1.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The UE group evaluation process assigns UEs with active voice service to the

VoiceGroup instance of the

UeServiceGroupDefinition MO class. These UEs are assigned UE

Service Group Type identifier 1. The rest of the UEs, which do not

have active voice service, belong to the Default group for the

UE Service Group Type by default.

When the system selects which instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg

MO class to apply to a specific UE, the UeCfg selection

algorithm has the following possible outcomes:

- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined VoiceGroup instance of the UeServiceGroupDefinition MO class are matched to the VoiceGroup instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the Default group are matched to the Base instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.

As a result, the feature is only enabled for UEs that do not have a voice service

established.

### 3.5.4 Handling UEs with Hard Limitations

With the UE Grouping Framework, it is possible to treat UEs with hard limitations

differently from the perspective of a given feature.

#### 3.5.4.1 Handle UEs with Hard Limitations Using IMEI-TAC or IMEISV

In this scenario, a fictive feature called MyFeature exists.

```
MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = Base:
- enabled = true
- attribute 1 = 10
- attribute 2 = 20
- prefUeGroupList = empty
- ueGroupList = empty
- ueConfGroupList = empty
```

This scenario is based on the following assumptions:

- All configuration data used by MyFeature is found in the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- The MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class includes an enabled attribute, which controls whether the feature is enabled.
- MyFeature is activated for all UEs regardless of which UE groups they belong to.
- It is detected that a certain UE model faces problems when MyFeature is activated.
- The aim is to resolve the problem by defining a preference UE group for the problematic UE model and disable MyFeature for this preference UE group.

In the beginning, the system does not have any explicit groups defined for any of the

group types. This implies that all UEs belong to the Default

group of their respective group types by default. With these conditions fulfilled,

the system applies the same configuration to all UEs based on the settings defined

by the Base instance of the

MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.

Steps

1. Define a Preference UE Group Type instance that includes all UEs of the problematic model. In this case, the Preference UE Group Type is used to ensure that the problematic UE model is differentiated correctly and with the highest priority. The algorithm that selects UeCfg instances always prioritizes instances that explicitly match UEs that belong to preference UE groups. There are different alternatives to select all UEs of the problematic model. Only one of the following alternatives needs to be chosen: Example PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ProblematicUeModel - selectionCriteria = "imeitac == 12345678" - prefUeGroupId = 1 - prefUeGroupPriority = 1 The problematic UE model has an IMEI-TAC value of 12345678. Example PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ProblematicUeModel - selectionCriteria = "imeisv == ref" - prefUeGroupId = 1 - prefUeGroupPriority = 1 - imeiSvRef = GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1,ImeiSvs=imeisvs1 ImeiSvs with RDN = imeisvs1 - imeiSvsId = imeisvs1 - imeiSvsGroupRef = GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1,ImeiSvGroups=1, ImeiSvGroup=imeisvGroup1 ImeiSvGroup with RDN = imeisvGroup1 - imeiTacSvSnList = {tac=12345678, minSn=1, maxSn=999999, minSvn=0, maxSvn=98; tac=12345679, minSn=1, maxSn=999999, minSvn=0, maxSvn=98} For the IMEISV value elements of the problematic UE models in this example, see Table 4. Table 4 IMEISV Values of Example Problematic UE Models Type Allocation Code (TAC) Serial Number (SNR) Range Software Version Number (SVN) Range 12345678 000000-999999 00-98 12345679 000000-999999 00-98 For the full configuration of IMEISV value ranges, see Figure 2.

![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)
4. Add a second instance of MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with the feature disabled. Example MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = ProblematicUeModel: - enabled = false - attribute 1 = 10 - attribute 2 = 20 - prefUeGroupList = 1 - ueGroupList = empty - ueConfGroupList = empty Setting the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg.prefUeGroupList attribute to 1 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the preference UE group with the identifier value 1.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The UE group evaluation process assigns UEs of the problematic model to the defined

preference UE group. These UEs are assigned preference UE Group Type identifier

1. The rest of the UEs belong to the

Default group for the preference UE Group Type by

default.

When the system selects which instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg

MO class to apply to a specific UE, the UeCfg selection

algorithm has the following possible outcomes:

- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined ProblematicUeModel instance of the PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile MO class are matched to the ProblematicUeModel instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the Default group of the Preference UE Service Group Type are matched to the Base instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.

As a result, the feature is disabled for UEs of the problematic UE model.

#### 3.5.4.2 Handle UEs with Hard Limitations Using Chipset Identifier

In this scenario, a fictive feature called MyFeature exists.

```
MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = Base:
- enabled = true
- attribute 1 = 10
- attribute 2 = 20
- prefUeGroupList = empty
- ueGroupList = empty
- ueConfGroupList = empty
```

This scenario is based on the following assumptions:

- All configuration data used by MyFeature is found in the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- The MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class includes an enabled attribute, which controls whether the feature is enabled.
- MyFeature is activated for all UEs regardless of which UE groups they belong to.
- It is detected that a certain UE model faces problems when MyFeature is activated.
- The aim is to resolve the problem by defining a preference UE group for the problematic UE model and disable MyFeature for this preference UE group.

In the beginning, the system does not have any explicit groups defined for any of the

group types. This implies that all UEs belong to the Default

group of their respective group types by default. With these conditions fulfilled,

the system applies the same configuration to all UEs based on the settings defined

by the Base instance of the

MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.

Steps

1. Define a Preference UE Group Type instance that includes all UEs of the problematic model. In this case, the Preference UE Group Type is used to ensure that the problematic UE model is differentiated correctly and with the highest priority. The algorithm that selects UeCfg instances always prioritizes instances that explicitly match UEs that belong to preference UE groups. There are different alternatives to select all UEs of the problematic model based on chipset ID. Only one of the following alternatives needs to be chosen: Example PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ProblematicUeModel - selectionCriteria = "chipset == 16.10.100" - prefUeGroupId = 1 - prefUeGroupPriority = 1 In this example, the problematic UE model chipset identifier has the following values: Vendor value 16 Variant value 10 Version value 100 Example PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile with RDN = ProblematicUeModel - selectionCriteria = "chipset == ref" - prefUeGroupId = 1 - prefUeGroupPriority = 1 - chipsetRef = GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1,Chipsets=chipsetList1 Chipsets with RND chipsetList1 - chipsetList = {vendor=1, variant=1, minVer=1, maxVer=9999; vendor=2, variant=1, minVer=1, maxVer=9999} For the chipset identifier values of the problematic UE models in this example, see Table 5. Table 5 Chipset Identifier Values of Example Problematic UE Models Vendor Variant Version Range 1 1 1-9999 2 1 1-9999 For the full configuration of chipset identifier ranges, see Figure 3.

4. Add a second instance of MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with the feature disabled. Example MyFeatureCtrUeCfg with RDN = ProblematicUeModel: - enabled = false - attribute 1 = 10 - attribute 2 = 20 - prefUeGroupList = 1 - ueGroupList = empty - ueConfGroupList = empty Setting the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg.prefUeGroupList attribute to 1 means that the gNodeB only uses this MO instance for UEs that belong to the preference UE group with the identifier value 1.
![Image](../images/33_1553-LZA7016017_1Uen.FJ/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The UE group evaluation process assigns UEs of the problematic model to the defined

preference UE group. These UEs are assigned preference UE Group Type identifier

1. The rest of the UEs belong to the

Default group for the preference UE Group Type by

default.

When the system selects which instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg

MO class to apply to a specific UE, the UeCfg selection

algorithm has the following possible outcomes:

- UEs that belong to the explicitly defined ProblematicUeModel instance of the PrefUeGroupSelectionProfile MO class are matched to the ProblematicUeModel instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.
- UEs that belong to the Default group of the Preference UE Service Group Type are matched to the Base instance of the MyFeatureCtrUeCfg MO class.

As a result, the feature is disabled for UEs of the problematic UE model.

### 3.5.5 Multi-Service Selection with Flow Expression

If the selection criteria match the combination of flow-dependent variables, flow

expression is used for multi-service selection.

The defined selection criterion is split into individual expressions, which are referred

to as flow expressions. A flow expression is denoted with surrounding square brackets

and indicates that its evaluation is performed for each QoS flow.

For example, in Figure 4, the selection criterion

is evaluated against each flow by

using

flow expressions, that

is,

[5qi==1] must match one flow, and [5qi==9] must

also match one flow. As a result, the UE with 234-56 PLMN value,

5QI

1 and 5QI 9 criteria is evaluated as true.

network.

## 5.1 21.Q4: UE Grouping Framework for High-Band

This feature enhancement enables the use of the UE Grouping Framework for

High-Band.

| Feature Name:           | UE Grouping Framework   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5314            |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002            |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node     |
| Access Type:            | NR                      |

Summary and Benefits

The UE Grouping Framework feature enables UE group-specific configuration

parameters.

With the framework, it is possible to have a maximum of 8 preference UE groups and 16

UE groups. The UE always belongs to one preference UE group and one UE group.

Preference UE groups are intended to address UE limitations that require prioritized

configurations. UE groups are designed with the intention of applying temporary

configuration and A/B testing.

The framework uses EBS-N flexible counters to enable observability for each

preference UE group and for each UE group.

On top of the framework, the following optional feature is introduced for

High-Band:

- NR Service-Adaptive DRX

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following parameters can be used to define UE grouping for High-Band:

- QCI
- ARP
- PLMN
- SPID
- CG Role
- Masked IMEISV

Interfaces

In High-Band, the following X2AP messages trigger UE group evaluation and

re-evaluation:

- SGNB ADDITION REQUEST
- SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST

The new or updated UE group information is transferred through the F1AP interface to

the gNodeB-DU in the following messages:

- F1AP UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
- F1AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.

## 5.2 21.Q4: Enhancement for UE Grouping Framework

The UE Grouping Framework is updated with the two new UE Configuration

Groups.

| Feature Name:           | UE Grouping Framework   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5314            |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package         |

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node     |
| Access Type:            | NR                      |

The UE Configuration Group Type enables differentiated configuration for groups, based on

selection criteria,such as different PLMNs or services. It targets long-term or

permanent configuration.

The UE Configuration Group Type includes the following group types:

- UE Mobility Group Type
- UE Service Group Type

The two new UE Configuration Group Types complement the existing Preference UE Group

Type, and the UE Group Type that primarily target differentiated handling of UEs with

hard limitations, temporary configurations, and A/B testing.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The two new UE Configuration Group Types are defined using the following new MO

classes:

- UeMobilityGroupDefinition
- UeServiceGroupDefinition

The MO classes adapted to the UE Grouping Framework, and that support UE

Configuration Group Types include the new ueConfGroupList

attribute, and the new ueConfGroupType attribute. These

attributes define which of the two UE Configuration Group Types are used. The UE

Grouping Framework uses these two attributes in the selection algorithm where it

applies an MO class instance to a UE depending on the UE group that is assigned to

the UE.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware
