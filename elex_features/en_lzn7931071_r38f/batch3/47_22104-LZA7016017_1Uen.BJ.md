Summary

The NR Air Interface Load Generator feature enables field testing with artificial load in

cases when the real UE load is lower than the required level. The feature fills up

the load in the system with PRBs for PDSCH, and with CCEs for PDCCH. PRBs and CCEs

generated by the NR Air Interface Load Generator feature are allocated, if

necessary, after the allocation of PRBs and CCEs to the real UE is completed.

In cells using TDD AAS radios, the feature supports beamforming.

Artificial load helps to reduce the time and cost of field testing.

Hardware

The beamforming of the artificial load is only supported on TDD AAS radios.

Limitations

The feature does not support High-Band deployments.

The feature only supports the beamforming of the artificial load on one beam at a

time.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Air Interface Load Generator

The radio node generates artificial load to meet the target load level based on the

UE load. The generated load is lower priority than the real UE

load.

The NR Air Interface Load Generator feature fills up the number of PRBs and CCEs in the

system up to the required level when the PDSCH and PDCCH load generated by real UEs is

below the minimum level. The minimum level can be set through MOM parameters. The number

of PRBs and CCEs used for the artificial load is calculated based on the configuration

data. The artificial load is generated by padding already allocated PDSCH PRBs and PDCCH

CCEs with additional PRBs and CCEs that contain dummy data.

The artificial load is generated only towards specified directions if all the following

conditions are met:

- The beamforming is enabled and the directions are configured in the MOM.
- The data is transmitted through a TDD AAS radio.

If more than one CSI-RS configuration is active in the cell, the artificial load on PDSCH

is generated according to the CSI-RS configuration with the highest number of ports.

Operational Process

Figure 1    Artificial Load Added to Minimum DL PRB Load Level

When the NR Air Interface Load Generator feature is active, the radio node monitors

the PDSCH load in each TTI as follows:

1. The feature calculates current total load from ordinary allocations (real UE).
2. The feature calculates padding PRBs and selects the allocations for artificial load.
3. The feature transports the data for artificial load.

Figure 2   Artificial Load Added to Minimum PDCCH Load Level

The radio node monitors the PDCCH load in each TTI as follows:

1. When all necessary PDCCH CCEs are allocated for UEs in that TTI, the feature calculates the total number of allocated CCEs.
2. The feature calculates the number of padding CCEs based on the configured NRCellDU.ailgPdcchLoadLevel and already allocated PDCCH CCEs.
3. The feature allocates the padding CCEs among available PDCCH CCEs and sends the PDCCH allocation information to the physical layer for transmission.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Air Interface Load Generator

This feature affects UE performance by influencing the PDCCH detection and the SINR for

the real UE.

Capacity and Performance

With the feature activated, the UE performance is impacted in the following ways:

- PRB allocation is triggered in such a way that the PDSCH is transmitted to the Air Interface Load Generator UE using one common beam. If the real UE is located at a certain point in the cell neighboring the one in which the test UE is, the SINR for the real UE can decrease.
- CCE allocation is triggered in such a way that multiple PDCCHs are transmitted to the Air Interface Load Generator UE using one common beam. If the real UE is located at a certain point in the cell neighboring the one in which the Air Interface Load Generator UE is, the PDCCH detection for the real UE can be influenced.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Air Interface Load Generator

This feature introduces attributes for configuring generated artifical load level,

modulation type, and beam direction.

| Parameter                         | Type       | Description          |
|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| NRCellDU.ailgDlPrbLoadLevel       | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| NRCellDU.ailgModType              | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of NR Air Interface Load Generator

This feature uses one counter related to the number of PRBs generated on

PDSCH.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The total number of PRBs generated by the artificial load on PDSCH can be monitored

through the NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAilg counter.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Air Interface Load Generator

The feature supports beamforming with TDD AAS radios. Configuring the beam direction

can be done with MO attributes and tables that map the beam directions to the beam index

values.

The direction of the generated artificial load can be set according to the i11 and i12

codebook PMIs with the NRCellDU.ailgI11BeamDirection and the

NRCellDU.ailgI12BeamDirection MO attributes.

As Figure 3 shows, the following angles describe

the direction of the configured beams:

| Elevation angle (θ)   |    | Elevation angle is the vertical angle that is relative to the transverse                         plane passing through the center of the antenna array. It is shown as theta                         angle. Positive values cause the beam to be aimed downward and negative                         values cause the beam to be aimed upward.                |
|-----------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                       |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Azimuth angle (φ)     |    | Azimuth angle is the horizontal angle that is relative to the sagittal plane                     passing through the center of the antenna array. It is shown as phi angle.                     Looking from above, positive values cause the beam to be aimed clockwise and                     negative values cause the beam to be aimed counterclockwise. |

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q2: Beamforming Support for NR Air Interface Load Generator

This feature enhancement introduces beamforming support for the NR Air Interface Load

Generator feature.

| Feature Name           | NR Air Interface Load Generator   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5191                      |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides codebook and PMI-based beamforming for the NR Air

Interface Load Generator feature. This allows the creation of artificial load in a

specified beam direction instead of generating cell-wide artificial traffic load.

This artificial load can be used for the following field test cases:

- During EMF measurements, percentage of the traffic load can be configured on a certain traffic beam to measure the EMF exposure at arbitrary locations.
- Before activating a radio on a new or an existing site, the product installation compliance assessments can be performed on the new radio without real UE load.
- Full power inter-cell interference measurements can be performed towards another radio.
- It can be verified that the EMF Power Lock feature maintains the average power below the configured limit.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes:

- NRCellDU.ailgBeamDirectionEnabled
- NRCellDU.ailgI11BeamDirection
- NRCellDU.ailgI12BeamDirection

This feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAilg PM counter.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This enhancement is only supported on TDD AAS radios.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

## Appendix A.b: 23.Q4: Beamforming Support for NR Air Interface Load Generator on PDCCH

The feature enhancement extends support for

beamformed

PDCCH when

artificial

PDCCH load is generated on a selected codebook beam.

|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5191                      |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                      |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node               |
| Access Type            | NR                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                          |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement offers more testing opportunities with the NR Air Interface

Load Generator feature. A specific codebook beam can be selected for generating

artificial

PDCCH load.

The following example test cases can be used for network planning, especially planning

related to compliance with EMF regulatory requirements:

- Measuring the PDCCH coverage of a specific beam
- Measuring PDCCH interference in the cell
- Measuring EMF emissions in a sensitive direction
- Configuring the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature

The feature enhancement is only supported

with

single-user MIMO and rank 1 UEs.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The NRCellDU.ailgPdcchBeamDirectionEnabled attribute is introduced

to enable the feature enhancement.

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdcchAilg

counter,

which can be used to observe the number of resource block symbols generated on

PDCCH.

If the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature is enabled, the

generated artificial PDCCH load contributes to one of the directions used by the

feature for calculated time-averaged transmitted power.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
