# 1 Welcome to News About CPI

To improve the customer experience, Ericsson is constantly

developing the structure and scope of the information as well as the tools for accessing

it. When introduced, the main changes and improvements will be presented in this

document.

Once every quarter a new section, outlining the most recent information, is added into

the document. This chronological structure is designed to make the document easier to

navigate.

# 2 2025 Q2

## 2.1 Introduction of Manage Documents Replacing Sections of the Manage Hardware Equipment Document

From the MTR 25.13 release, the following new manage documents are added to the CPI that

replaces parts of the Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband Radio Node (24/1553-LZA 701

6014/1) document:

- Manage Antenna System document with the document number 156/1553-LZA 701 6014/1 that replaces Antenna System section in the Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband Radio Node document. This document is the main source of information for antenna system configuration.
- Manage Fronthaul document with the document number 157/1553-LZA 701 6014/1 that replaces the Fronthaul section and the Package Fronthaul section in the Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband Radio Node document. This document is the main source of information for fronthaul configuration.
- Manage Support System document with the document number 151/1553-LZA 701 6014/1 that replaces the following parts in the Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband Radio Node document: Support System Power System for RBS 6000 Environment Climate System for RBS 6000 Environment Battery This document is the main source of information for configuration of RBS 6000 support system and support units.

Table 1   Introduction of Manage Documents Replacing Sections of the Manage Hardware

Equipment

## 2.2 Change in the Grouping Terminology of Radio Units

Starting from the MTR 25.15 and 25.Q2.0 releases, the grouping terminology of radio

units changes in CPI.

Starting from the MTR 25.15 and 25.Q2.0 releases, the grouping terminology of radio units

changes as follows:

- AAS-capable radio unit changes to Massive MIMO radio unit. The term AAS-capable radio unit is no longer used.
- Non-AAS-capable radio unit changes to Remote radio unit with external antenna. The term non-AAS-capable radio unit is no longer used.
- Non-beamforming AIR unit changes to Remote radio unit with integrated antenna. The term non-beamforming AIR unit is no longer used.

All CPI documents that mention the affected terms are aligned with the updated

terminology except for the following ones:

- An additional text of the MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm that mentions non-AAS-capable radio units
- The MOM descriptions that mention the affected terms
- The topics in the Network Impact Report released before MTR 25.15 and 25.Q2.0

The change includes the renaming of the Common Channel Beamforming on Non-AAS Radios

feature (FAJ 121 5179) to Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units. Starting

from the 25.Q2.0 and MTR 25.23 releases, the feature name is updated in all CPI

documents, including the feature description.

Related Information

Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units

## 2.3 Carrier Allocation Rules in the Radio Capabilities

The Carrier Allocation Rules chapter is included in the Radio Capabilities document in the Radio Node Configuration

library. It contains generic rules for carrier allocation that cover all use cases. At

the same time, some redundant information is removed from the Excel table of Supported Radio Capabilities, like the tabs

'Radio' and 'RDS - Dot' no longer contain columns and data for 'DL per Radio' and 'UL

per Radio'.

# 3 2025 Q1

## 3.1 Removal of Supported Capacity and Configurations for Critical IoT RAN Excel from CPI

From 25.Q1.1, the Supported Capacity and Configurations for Critical IoT RAN document

with the 14/1551-LZA 701 6017 document number is removed. For capacity and

configurations information applicable to Critical IoT RAN, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR

RAN.

## 3.2 Feature Status List Limitations

The Feature Status lists include a subset of all commercial features, enhancements, and

system improvements:

- 1/198 12-FGB 101 0937 (5G)
- 3/198 12-FGB 101 469 (LTE)
- 1/198 12-FGB 101 0713 (Massive IoT)

For obtaining a complete list of introduced features, enhancements, and system

improvements for each release, refer to the Network Impact Report, and for features and

their enhancements, the Feature Description documents.

## 3.3 Introduced Hardware and Software Compatibility Document

The Hardware and Software Compatibility document provides

compatibility information between NR SW features and RAN Compute HW products. This

document is first released in MTR 25.05 with document number 314/006 51-LZA 701 6014,

and the compatibility information is mapped to key changes and new features in each

release versions from MTR 24.47 onwards.

## 3.4 Introduced Manage Radio Units Document

From MTR 24.49 release, the Manage Radio Units document is added to CPI with document

number 152/1553-LZA 701 6014/1. This document is serving as a default reference point of

information as compared to any additional configuration or deployment with radio CPI.

The following source documents were used for the new document:

- Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband Radio Node, 24/1553-LZA 701 6014/1
- Manage Radio Network NR, 1/1553-LZA 701 6017/1
- Manage Radio Network LTE, 44/1553-LZA 701 6014/1

## 3.5 Introduced Manage RAN Compute Document

From the 25.Q1 GA release, the Manage RAN Compute document is added to CPI with the

document number 154/1553-LZA 701 6014. This document is the main source of information

for configuration and deployment of RAN Compute. Manage RAN Compute replaces the

Baseband section in the Manage Hardware Equipment Baseband Radio Node document,

24/1553-LZA 701 6014, which was the main source of information during the creation of

the Manage RAN Compute document.

# 4 2024 Q4

## 4.1 Introduced Manage Feature Activation and Enabling Document

The Manage Feature Activation and Enabling document is added to

CPI with the document number 37/1553-LZA 701 6017/1. This document clarifies the process

of feature activation and enabling.

# 5 2024 Q3

## 5.1 Name Change of Multi-User MIMO Features

The following feature names change in CPI:

- Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band (FAJ 121 5130) changes to Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band.
- Uplink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band (FAJ 121 5011) changes to Uplink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band.

The changes are applicable from 24.Q3 GA. This means that the NIR topics released before

are still containing the old feature names.

## 5.2 RAN Compute Group 6 Information Introduced to CPI

From the 24.Q3 GA release, information on RAN Compute group 6 units are officially

introduced in CPI, starting with information on RAN Processor 6672.

## 5.3 RCG123 in Maintenance Phase

Software CPI for RAN Compute groups 1-3 (RCG123) is in maintenance phase. RCG123 CPI is

published less frequently, contains fault corrections, and limited functionality

updates.

The RCG123 Maintenance Collection is found in CPI Store for all applicable RAN products

under the RCG123 folders.

## 5.4 Removal of Lists and Delta Lists Baseband Excel from the CPI

In 2023 Q4, the Baseband and NR list and delta list files were merged into one file using

an automatized solution (Lists and Delta Lists Referral Document, 3/1551-CXP 903 6845).

The old Baseband list and delta list excel file (189/006 51-LZA 701 6014) was kept until

now, but it is going to be removed from 24.Q3 GA release.

# 6 2024 Q2

## 6.1 Delta Documentation in Supported Capacity and Configurations Documents

From MTR 24.21 and 24.Q2, delta documentation is available in all Supported Capacity

and Configurations documents under the Change History tab.

This delta documentation complements the Network Impact Report by adding a log of changes

that helps to highlight the completed improvements affecting capacity figures in both

MTR and Q releases.

The following documents are affected:

- Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN (57/1551-LZA 701 6014)
- Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN (54/1551-LZA 701 6017)
- Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE-NR FDD Spectrum Sharing (66/1551-LZA 701 6017)
- Supported Capacity and Configurations for Critical IoT RAN (14/1551-LZA 701 6017)

# 7 2024 Q1

## 7.1 Common Network Impact Report for GA Releases and New Release Information Library

The Network Impact Reports for all areas but WCDMA and GSM are merged into one common

Network Impact Report. More filtering options are added so that it is possible to filter

on, for example, NR if that is the only area of interest. This common Network Impact

Report contains content valid for 24.Q1 onward.

The old area-unique Network Impact Reports are discontinued but they will still be kept

in the ELEX libraries.

The new common Network Impact Report have a somewhat different structure. The main

sections are:

- Important Highlights (contains information that today is mainly in the Release Note)
- Non-Backwards Compatible Changes and Heads-Up (contains information that today is mainly in the Release Note)
- Feature-Related and System Improvement
- Corrected Trouble Reports

A new Release Information ELEX library was created. This new ELEX library contains the

Network Impact Reports, both the old area unique ones and the new common one.

## 7.2 Document Number Change of Lithium Battery Fault Report

In the Power library, the document number for HW CPI document Lithium Battery Fault

Report has been changed from 1/0360-303/FEA 292 6603 to GFFI-20:018056.

## 7.3 Name Change of Time Configured Peak Load Shifting to Time-Configured Peak Load Shifting

The name of the Controller 6610 feature Time Configured Peak Load Shifting (FAJ 121 5488)

is changed to Time-Configured Peak Load Shifting.

## 7.4 Name Change of PIM-Related Features

The following PIM-related feature names change in CPI:

- LTE PIM Avoidance in Baseband (FAJ 121 5448) changes to LTE PIM Avoidance.
- LTE PIM Detection in Baseband (FAJ 121 5436) changes to LTE PIM Detection.
- NR PIM Avoidance in Baseband (FAJ 121 5502) changes to NR PIM Avoidance.
- NR PIM Detection in Baseband (FAJ 121 5501) changes to NR PIM Detection.

The changes are applicable from MTR 23.51, and 24.Q1 GA. This means that the NIR topics

released before MTR 23.51 still contain old feature names.

# 8 2023 Q4

## 8.1 Environmental Characteristics Chapters Updated in the Enclosure Library

From December 2023, information about the distance of the product from the coastline and

from sea wind are removed and a new subsection called Corrosivity Category under

Technical Data section is added.

The following documents are affected:

## 8.2 Ericsson Reduced Capability Product CPI Is Released in the NR RAN Library in 23.Q4

The new Ericsson Reduced Capability product, under the NR RAN product, is a software

addition to the NR standalone deployment enabling new NR use cases for reduced

capability devices. The CPI describing the Ericsson Reduced Capability product is

published first in the 23.Q4 GA release.

All Ericsson Reduced Capability-related information can be found in the NR RAN library,

no separate CPI product library is created for the Ericsson Reduced Capability product.

The following documents are published in the scope of the 23.Q4 GA release:

- Ericsson Reduced Capability Enabler
- Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package

The Ericsson Reduced Capability Enabler document is found among the NR Feature

Descriptions in the Features and Capacities folder in the NR RAN library. The Ericsson

Reduced Capability Base Package document is found among the NR Commercial Product

Descriptions in the Base and Value Packages folder in the NR RAN library.

## 8.3 Merged Baseband and NR Lists and Delta Lists Files

The Baseband and NR lists and delta lists files are merged into one file from MTR 23.43

using the automatized solution that is already in use for the NR lists and delta lists

files. The Baseband lists and delta lists file that are generated in Excel will remain

until further notice.

## 8.4 Removing Links to Non-Maintained Feature Videos from CPI

Ericsson Play links that lead to non-maintained Feature Videos are removed from CPI

starting from MTR 23.41.

Feature Videos are still available at Ericsson Play. The Details section is updated with

information regarding the relevant release.

# 9 2023 Q3

## 9.1 5G Plug-Ins for LTE Removed from the Library

This document introduced the 5G Plug-In value packages and gave an overview of the

features that included in the specific value packages. From 23.Q3, the 5G Plug-Ins for

LTE document is removed from the library. The following Commercial Product Descriptions

can be found in the library separately:

- Basic Massive MIMO (48/221 01-LZA 701 6014/1)
- Intelligent Connectivity (51/221 01-LZA 701 6014/1)
- Latency Reduction (61/221 01-LZA 701 6014/1)

# 10 2023 Q1

## 10.1 Filtering in Alarm Summary Tables

Filterable alarm summary tables are introduced for alarms with multiple fault scenarios.

This enables faster browsing to the remedy action.

Figure 1   Example Filtering in Alarm Summary Table

## 10.2 PDF Files Created on the Fly Replace Embedded PDF File

To reduce the size and download time for the ELEX libraries, PDF files are no longer

embedded in the libraries. Instead the HTML document content can be saved or printed as

PDF from menu in top right corner: Print or save content shown as PDF.

Figure 2   Print or Save Content Shown as PDF

## 10.3 Managed Element Type Name Added to MOM Folders

Library collections can be browsed with a merged library TOC. Managed Object Model (MOM)

folders are not merged as other folders in the contents panel. Instead all MOM folders

from the original libraries are listed in the library TOC. To indicate MOM folder

content, the name of the managed element type are appended to the MOM folder name.

The MOM information for the Baseband Radio Node is included in several ELEX libraries.

This results in several MOM folders with the same content in library collections with

merged library TOC.

Figure 3   Example MOM Folders in Library Collection with Merged TOC

## 10.4 Release Candidate (RC) releases for the MTR Network Impact Report

Additional releases are introduced for the Release Information library (EN/LZN 793 1082)

containing the Network Impact Report for MTR releases. The additional releases capture

functions added after the last MTR CPI release before a new quarterly release. The

releases are called Release Candidates (RCs) and that is also reflected in the name of

the library. Final quarterly release content is communicated in the RAN Feature Status

list and in the Network Impact Report for Q-releases.

Figure 4   Example of RC Release

# 11 2022 Q4

## 11.1 Separate Network Impact Report for MTR Releases

A separate Network Impact Report is introduced for the MTR releases. The document can be

found in the Release Information (EN/LZN 793 1082) library, which is part of all RAN

collections except GSM and WCDMA.

The structure of the MTR Network Impact Report differs from the GA version: the NIR

topics are included on the top level. Information on mandatory, optional, and new

feature is instead available with the help of a filter.

The NIR topics contain additional information on internal Ericsson reference SP number,

MTR release, F-state as well as information on known limitations and temporary

configuration options. The NIR topics are added at FX and FA. The term "Planned" in the

topic title is no longer used.

## 11.2 Planned Features Folder Removed From RAN Libraries

From November 2022, the Planned Features and Capacities library folder is removed from

the RAN libraries. All feature descriptions are placed in the Features and Capacities

folder, information about release status can be found in the Network Impact Report and

the RAN Feature Status list files.

## 11.3 Network Impact Report - Structural Changes

A new section called Temporarily Restricted Functions is added to the Network Impact

Reports. The old section called Planned Functions is removed.

## 11.4 Controller 6610 and SCU 09 01 Software Libraries in Hardware Collections

The managed element information for these products is now available also in the ERS

Hardware Elex library collection (Ericsson Radio System Hardware - Antenna System, Enclosure, Integrated

Site Solutions, Network Synchronization, Power, Radio, RAN Compute and

RBS).

Figure 5   Controller Software Libraries in the ERS Hardware Collection

The information has been and is still available in the Support System Collection. The

Support System Collection for supported software releases is available in the following

product categories on CPI Extranet:

- Radio System/Radio System Hardware/Enclosure (https://al4b.cpi.ericsson.net/elex?FC=Radio+System/Radio+System+Hardware/Enclosure)
- Radio System/Radio System Hardware/Power (https://al4b.cpi.ericsson.net/elex?FC=Radio+System/Radio+System+Hardware/Power)

## 11.5 RDS Reference Added in RAN Collections

The Radio Dot System Elex library collection is published in product folder Radio Access

Network: https://al4b.cpi.ericsson.net/elex?FF=Radio+Access+Network/Radio+Dot+System.

A reference to the library collection is now added in RAN library collections.

Dot System Library Collection

# 12 2022 Q3

## 12.1 Document Number and Title Change for Supported Capacity and Configurations Documents

From 22.Q3, the titles of both the LTE and NR versions of Supported Capacity and

Configurations have been changed to reflect the RAT each document represents. The

document number of the NR version also has been changed.

The following changes have been performed:

Table 2   Document Number and Title Change for Supported Capacity and Configurations

Documents

| Previous Title and Document Number                          | Current Title and Document Number                                                                                                   |

| Supported Capacity and Configurations  57/1551-LZA 701 6014 | Supported Capacity and                                         Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN  57/1551-LZA 701 6014 |
| Supported Capacity and Configurations  54/1551-LZA 701 6014 | Supported Capacity and                                         Configurations for NR RAN  54/1551-LZA 701 6017                      |

## 12.2 Removing Simplified SMTC Configuration from the CPI

The long Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) format is phased out because of the Planned: Extension of Simplified SMTC

Configuration system improvement. With this system improvement, the long RDNs

that are used for the NRFrequency and the

GUtranSyncSignalFequency MO classes are converted to the short

RDN format after upgrade. For this, the Simplified SMTC Configuration document is removed at MTR

22.21 from the CPI.

## 12.3 Revamp of Radio Node Configurations Hardware CPI Library

All RAT-specific Mixed Mode chapters with RBB combination tables are removed from the

library. They are replaced with a RAT-agnostic RBB combinations table and generic

rules.

The new RBB combinations table has to be cross-read against the RBB tables for each RAT

in the mixed mode configuration to validate the support. For more details, see the rules

in the Radio Configurations for Multistandard and Single

Standard Mixed Mode section in the Radio Node Configurations

library.

# 13 2022 Q2

## 13.1 Delta Documentation in Supported Capacity and Configurations Documents

From MTR 22.15 and 22.Q2, delta documentation is available in all Supported Capacity and

Configurations documents under the Change History tab.

The affected documents are the following:

- Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN (57/1551-LZA 701 6014)
- Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN (54/1551-LZA 701 6017)
- Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE-NR FDD Spectrum Sharing (66/1551-LZA 701 6017)
- Supported Capacity and Configurations for Critical IoT RAN (14/1551-LZA 701 6017)

This delta documentation complements the Network Impact Report by adding a log of changes

and helps to highlight the completed improvements affecting capacity figures in both MTR

and Q releases.

## 13.2 Merging Mixed Mode Documents into Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide

The Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide was previously only valid for Mixed Mode

Baseband. Now, it is expanded with Mixed Mode Radio and Mixed Mode Baseband R.

In 2021 Q1, a single source document was introduced to gather information that were

connected to Mixed Mode. In 2022 Q2, Mixed Mode Radio, Mixed Mode Baseband R, and Manage

Mixed Mode documents are merged into the Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide.

Because of the merging, the following document become obsolete and are removed:

- Mixed Mode Radio (396/221 04-LZA 701 6014/1)
- Mixed Mode Baseband (216/221 04-LZA 701 6014/1)
- Mixed Mode Baseband R503 (344/221 04-LZA 701 6014/1)
- Mixed Mode Guidelines (1/154 43-LZA 701 6014/1)
- Manage Mixed Mode (102/1553-LZA 701 6014/1)

The following libraries are affected by the removal:

- NR RAN
- LTE RAN
- WCDMA RAN
- GSM RAN
- Baseband Radio Node

# 14 2021 Q4

## 14.1 Changes to NR RAN Parameter Recommendations

In order to have a more stringent and future-proof handling of NR deployment scenarios in

NR RAN Parameter Recommendations List, changes to deployment scenarios are

introduced.

The purpose of these changes is the following:

- To have as clean and uncorrelated deployment scenarios as possible.
- To be able to independently maintain recommendations per deployment scenario.
- To be able to introduce or remove deployment scenarios with minimal impact to legacy.

The associated descriptive NR RAN Parameter Recommendations document has also been

updated to help the reader understand and interpret the NR recommendations.

## 14.2 New and Updated Functions in ELEX Version 5.0

# 15 2021 Q2

## 15.1 All-In-One User Guide for Mixed Mode

From 21.Q2 a single source document is introduced to gather information that is

connected to Mixed Mode.

The purpose of the Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide is to present different

aspects of Mixed Mode in a comprehensive manner, from basic definitions, through feature

descriptions, through initial configuration and O&amp;M procedures.

The introduced Mixed Mode All-In-One User Guide:

- Replaces Mixed Mode Baseband feature description
- Incorporates content from Manage Mixed Mode and Mixed Mode Guidelines

This change is applicable for all of these access types:

- NR
- LTE
- GSM
- WCDMA

## 15.2 Feature Name Change for FAJ 121 5147 and FAJ 121 5257

The following two feature names are changed in CPI:

- LTE-NR Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (FAJ 121 5147) is changed to LTE-NR FDD Spectrum Sharing Enabler
- Instant Spectrum Sharing Support for NR Standalone (FAJ 121 5257) is changed to LTE-NR FDD Spectrum Sharing with NR Standalone

## 15.3 Feature Videos Access

Feature Videos at Ericsson Play that are linked from CPI are available for external users

with Ericsson logon credentials (Ericsson signum and password) to My Ericsson.

Feature Videos are more described in Introducing Feature Videos in CPI.

# 16 2021 Q1

## 16.1 DUS in Maintenance Phase

CPI for DUS is in maintenance phase. This CPI is published quarterly and contains

fault corrections and limited functionality updates.

The RAN level information and ERS Hardware related information is included in the

collection, but it contains information that is not applicable for the DUS.

The DU Radio Node Collection is found at the CPI store for LTE Radio Access Network and

Massive IoT Radio Access Network with DUS Maintenance filter. See the example below.

Figure 15   DUS Maintenance

## 16.2 All-In-One User Guide for Ericsson Spectrum Sharing

The Ericsson Spectrum Sharing All-In-One User

Guide is restructured to present the complete ESS solution. The content

reorganization results in a logical and easy-to-navigate information for ESS deployment.

The document is now placed in the End-To-End Solutions folder in the ESS library, with

its searchability improved.

Summary of the changes on a document level:

- ESS content gathered in the form of one User Guide covering various ESS migration paths within a complete ESS operational flow. The content covering complete ESS solution is grouped depending on whether it applies to: solution as a whole, a specific stage in the product life cycle, one of the ESS scenarios to migrate towards the ESS EN-DC or ESS SA.
- Traditional feature descriptions for ESS features are removed from the library. The content for the features is incorporated into the User Guide as part of the complete solution description. Features are presented as building blocks for the ESS solution and shown in the context of deployment scenarios in which they are needed.
- Some content, such as the feature interactions, is presented on a feature level, while other type of content, such as the ESS prerequisites, is lifted to the ESS solution.
- Dependencies of the ESS features to LTE RAN and NR RAN features are collected in a single dedicated section with a Feature Dependencies table. This way, information about all feature dependencies of LTE-NR Dynamic Spectrum Sharing can be found in one place, the section is called "Dependencies of LTE-NR Dynamic Spectrum Sharing", and not (as previously) in separate sections.
- The flow images are used to facilitate navigating between operating procedures needed at various points in the ESS solution life cycle. The flow images are enriched with embedded links that serve as a quick point of entry for the procedures within each ESS scenario. The links at the end of each procedure allow quick return to the flow image.
- You can find the features required and the deployment flow needed to succeed with the intended ESS scenario to migrate towards the ESS SA or ESS EN-DC.

# 17 2020 Q4

## 17.1 Manage Bearers and Services Withdrawn from the Baseband Radio Node Library

Manage Bearers and Services NR has been withdrawn form the Baseband Radio

Node library with the 20.Q4.5 release. Information on NR-related bearer and QoS

management can be found in the following documentation:

- For an overview of bearers used in EN-DC, see the following documents: Basic Intelligent Connectivity LTE-NR Dual Connectivity System Description NR
- For an overview on bearers used in NR SA, see System Description NR.
- For the description of PDU sessions with QoS flows mapped to different DRBs, see QoS Framework.
- For an overview of QoS for NR, see Manage Quality of Service.
- For details on the QoS aspect of both EN-DC and NR SA, see E2E QoS Guideline.

## 17.2 Recommendations for 5G Plug-In, ESS and Massive IoT

Recommendations for features belonging to 5G Plug-In, ESS and Massive IoT are included in

the RAN Parameter Recommendation Lists document in the LTE RAN

library. This approach is chosen for practical and usability reasons, since 5G Plug-In,

ESS and Massive IoT are commonly deployed in many LTE networks. In the RAN

Parameter Recommendations Lists, the applicable features can be identified in

the Recommended Feature State sheet through the corresponding Value Package Name, and in

the comment section. Feature recommendations provide node level activation

recommendations. Parameter recommendations provide cell level recommendations. Verified

combinations of deployments can be found in the General Description sheet.

## 17.3 LTE RAN Added to NR RAN Library Collections

The LTE RAN library and the 5G Plug-Ins library are added to the NR RAN library

collection. The main purpose is to provide a single library collection for RAN EN-DC

information.

Figure 16   LTE RAN and 5G Plug-Ins in NR RAN Library Collections

Libraries in collections are visible for users based on access rights. To get access to

libraries, use normal procedures for CPI access requests.

## 17.4 Filter PM Counter

All PM Counters are categorized into PM Types, Areas and Scenarios. This categorization

enables grouping of the counters into use case scenarios. The information about

categorization is available for each PM Counter in their MOM description.

To see all PM Counters belonging to a particular use case scenario, go to the PM Counters

folder and use the filtering option. Search for a single PM counter or all PM Counters

of one MO class by using text strings in the headers of the column.

All NR Radio Node PM Counters have also a categorization for supported bands and

supported deployments. This information is visible in the Lists and Delta Lists

document. There is no filtering option for this functionality.

# 18 2020 Q2

## 18.1 New Format for RBS Configurations

There is a new name and format for the information in the RBS Configurations document.

The information is instead published as the library Radio Node Configurations.

Table 3   New Library

| Library Name              | Library Identity   |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Radio Node Configurations | EN/LZN 760 4009    |

The content of the new library consists of the content of RBS Configurations and the

documents in the Planning/Hardware Information folder in the hardware libraries listed.

These documents are removed from the hardware libraries, and are now published in the

Radio Node Configurations library. In addition, the Radio Node Configurations library is

included as a part of the library collection where the information was included

earlier.

Figure 17   Library Folder Structure

Table 4   Current Libraries

| Library Name              | Library Identity   |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Radio                     | EN/LZN 760 4002    |
| RAN Compute               | EN/LZN 760 4003    |
| Power                     | EN/LZN 760 4004    |
| Antenna System            | EN/LZN 760 4005    |
| Integrated Site Solutions | EN/LZN 760 4006    |
| Network Synchronization   | EN/LZN 760 4007    |
| Enclosure                 | EN/LZN 760 4008    |

The main titles of the RBS Configurations document are now library folders containing a

document with all the information from that section.

In addition, the introduction section of RBS Configurations has changed name to Radio

Node Configurations. This is done so that all links that before pointed to RBS

Configurations now point to Radio Node Configurations instead.

Figure 18   Current to New Format

Figure 19   Related Documents

Figure 20   Summary

The Radio Node Configurations library is published in the new folder Radio Node

Configurations. It is also published in the current Radio folder, to prevent folder

access issues, during a transition period.

Figure 21   Library Folders

## 18.2 Always Use Collections for ERS Products

A library collection is a group of libraries related to each other. Within the ERS

product area individual libraries only provide a limited scope, therefore it is

essential to use library collections when searching for information about ERS products.

One risks otherwise not getting the complete picture. Making searches in a collection

provides more results than in individual libraries, and with the added convenience of no

need to seek out a specific library.

How do you distinguish between collections and ordinary libraries? The easiest way is to

look at the associated icons. The collection icon has several boxes, while the library

icon only has one.

Figure 22   Collections for ERS Products

## 18.3 Merged Table of Contents in Library Collections

Navigating a library collection in the Contents panel is improved by merging the Table of

Contents. This means that all documents in the entire collection that falls within a

category are displayed when a category is selected.

The function is enabled or disabled by clicking the Actions icon in the Contents panel,

as seen in Figure 23. Then selecting Merge

library TOC or Separate library TOC. Current selection is retained between sessions. For

further details see How To Get Started with Ericsson Library Explorer.

Figure 23   Merge Table of Contents

## 18.4 Changed Structure of RAN Collections

With the new hardware libraries in place a restructure of the RAN collections

follows.

All hardware information is removed from the radio node libraries. The following

libraries now contain only software information:

- Baseband Radio Node, EN/LZN 793 1020
- DU Radio Node, EN/LZN 793 1010

From now on all RAN collections follow the same structure with a separate RAN unique

library, one or both radio node libraries, and applicable hardware libraries:

- XYZ RAN
- Baseband Radio Node
- DU Radio Node
- Antenna System
- Enclosure
- Integrated Site Solutions
- Network Synchronization
- Power
- Radio
- RAN Compute
- RBS Series

### 18.4.1 NR Collection

The Baseband Radio Node library is introduced in the NR collection, and by that some

information is removed from the NR RAN library. As a result of the change, the NR RAN

library is given the following new product identity: NR RAN, EN/LZN 793 1071.

### 18.4.2 GSM, WCDMA, LTE and Massive IoT Collections

All hardware information is removed from the radio node libraries. The new hardware

libraries are included in the RAN collections.

## 18.5 Recommendations for 5G Plug-In and Massive IoT

Recommendations for features belonging to 5G Plug-In and Massive IoT are included in the

LTE RAN library, in RAN Parameter Recommendation Lists document. This approach is chosen

for practical and usability reasons, since 5G Plug-In and Massive IoT are commonly

deployed in many LTE networks. In the RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists, the

applicable features can be identified in the Recommended Feature State sheet through the

corresponding Value Package Name, and in the Comment section.

## 18.6 YANG and ECIM Support in Baseband Radio Node and NR RAN Libraries

Table 5   Library Information Update with ONAP Support on gNodeB

| Information Introduced in Library                            | Baseband Radio Node   | NR RAN   | Description                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YANG data model                                              | Yes                   | Yes      | The YANG data model is used for the configuration management of                                     the gNodeB. |
| Baseband Radio Node supporting ONAP-based management systems | Yes                   | Yes      | An ONAP-based management system is used for gNodeB O&M.(1)                                                      |

(1)

ONAP support for RAN Compute is not applicable after

24.Q3.

With the introduction of the YANG data model, the libraries contain the following data

models supporting O&amp;M node configurations for the gNodeB:

- The YANG data model being a standard data modeling language
- The ECIM data model, on which the traditional Managed Object Model is based

However, both the Baseband Radio Node and the NR RAN libraries continue to use ECIM

terminology (MOs, attributes, etc.).

## 18.7 NR Lists and Delta Lists in Web Browser

The MOM information in the lists and delta lists files for NR is now presented based on

new functions and therefore slightly changed. It is no longer needed to open an Excel

document to see lists and delta-lists of parameters, alarms, counters and so on. Instead

they can be directly visible in the web browser. It is however still possible to

download the information into an Excel file for easier handling of the information.

## 18.8 DU Radio Node Library Released Quarterly

Since DUS 31 and DUS41 is in maintenance phase after 20Q1, DU Radio Node library is only

updated for corrections or other limited functional changes in quarterly GA releases. In

the MTR releases, the latest quarterly GA release of the DU Radio Node library will be

included.

## 18.9 DUS in Maintenance Phase since 20.Q2

The DU Radio Node library as well as unique documents for DUS will be removed from the

RAN Collections and published separately during the maintenance period. The library will

be called DU Radio Node Maint-1 , xxx Maint-2 etc.

# 19 2020 Q1

## 19.1 Change of Notes and Content Rating of the Feedback

The new feedback function is based on fully revamped notes and content rating functions.

The functionality and the old user interface are redesigned with a new and modern user

interface. The feedback icons automatically appear in the topics with feedback option.

New feedback buttons are added to the panel header that are updated dynamically to also

show feedback and content rating status.

The feedback buttons have the following major improvements:

- The feedback icon to topics has feedback items.
- The feedback items in all or in selected topics on document level and on topic levels can be shown or hidden.
- By clicking on a feedback item in topic context selected text can be highlighted directly.

Figure 24   The Feedback

The feedback supports the following content elements:

- paragraphs
- emphasis alternatives
- nested numbered lists
- nested ordered lists

Apart from Tagtool and DITA document types, the feedback is supported in the following

content types:

- MOM
- Yang model
- REST API content types

The new content rating function allows the user to provide a positive or negative rating

on document level and on topic level.

A topic level content rating is done by selecting any content in a topic, before clicking

on the Content Rating icon.

When providing a negative content rating, the user can select from multiple given

feedbacks.

## 19.2 Relocation of List File Information

Information today published in the top folder List Files are moved

to the Planning folder in coming releases. This apply to all

libraries with a List Files top folder.

## 19.3 Introducing Real-Time Security Event List Document

The newly introduced document lists syslog events sent from Baseband Radio Nodes as part

of the Real-Time Security Event Logging feature.

## 19.4 Hardware Library Replaced by new Libraries and Library Content Scope Change

The library Hardware Antenna System, Battery, Enclosure, Power,

Radio, RAN Compute (EN/LZN 760 4000) has been discontinued starting from the

February 2020 release.

The library has been replaced by seven (7) new libraries as listed below.

Table 6   New Libraries

| Library Name              | Library Identity   |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Radio                     | EN/LZN 760 4002    |
| RAN Compute               | EN/LZN 760 4003    |
| Power                     | EN/LZN 760 4004    |
| Antenna System            | EN/LZN 760 4005    |
| Integrated Site Solutions | EN/LZN 760 4006    |
| Network Synchronization   | EN/LZN 760 4007    |
| Enclosure                 | EN/LZN 760 4008    |

The seven (7) libraries can be found in the new library collection Ericsson Radio System Hardware - Antenna System, Enclosure,

Integrated Site Solutions, Network Synchronization, Power, Radio, RAN Compute, RBS

(EN/LZN 760 5043).

The content of the RBS Series library (EN/LZN 760 1000) has been updated. The folders in the RBS

Series library which contained documents for legacy radios, legacy RAN Compute and

legacy Power products have been moved to the following new libraries.

Table 7   Moved Content

| Folders in RBS Series containing   | Moved to (Library Name)   | Library Identity   |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Legacy Radios                      | Radio                     | EN/LZN 760 4002    |
| Legacy RAN Compute                 | RAN Compute               | EN/LZN 760 4003    |
| Legacy Power                       | Power                     | EN/LZN 760 4004    |

Access permission to the collection is not affected, but if customers encounter an access

problem, Ericsson Support Organizations must request access to the new collection using

the normal access request procedures.

## 19.5 DUS and RBS 6501 in Maintenance Phase

CPI will continue to be delivered for DUS, RBS 6302 and RBS 6501 after 20Q1 in the CPI

collections/libraries (LTE , Massive IoT, NR, WCDMA and HW). No documents or content

related to these products will be removed.

Following products have moved to a maintenance phase:

- DUS 31 , DUS41, and RBS 6302 is in maintenance phase after 20Q1. CPI is only updated for corrections or other limited functional changes in quarterly releases.
- RBS 6501 is in maintenance phase since 2019. CPI is only updated for corrections or other limited functional changes in quarterly releases.

# 20 2019 Q4

## 20.1 R-state Handling from Continuous Deliveries to Q-Releases

An improved R-state handling is valid for the following CPI libraries:

- LTE
- NR
- Massive IoT
- 5G Plug-Ins
- Baseband Radio Node
- DU Radio Node

R-state numbers were retained for continuous deliveries (MTR-releases) up until MTR

19.31. For Q-releases the R-state numbers were always increased for new quarters, see

examples in the following figures.

Figure 25   R-state Number 4 for all MTR releases of LTE RAN Libraries until MTR

19.33

Figure 26   R-state number increased to 14 in the First 19.Q2 Release

R-state handling is changed from MTR 19.33 in the following way:

- R-state number is increased in the first MTR release leading up to a new Q-release. For example MTR 19.33 is the first MTR release in the 19.Q4 development. The LTE RAN library has R-State R16A (R15 is for the Q3-releases).
- The increased R-state number from the MTR releases is kept in the Q releases. Example: The LTE RAN for 19.Q4 has R-states starting with R16.

Figure 27   First LTE RAN MTR Release Leading up to 19.Q4 is Increased to 16

Due to this change Copy link to the latest function becomes available

for CPI users. The function is based on R-state of the library.

Figure 28   Function Copy Link to Latest

## 20.2 MOM CPI for All Upgrade Packages

The Baseband Radio Node MOM CPI is valid for the following upgrade packages:

- CXP9024418/6 for CPRI configurations
- CXP9024418/12 for eCPRI configurations

The MOM CPI information is not taken from the upgrade packages. This means that the MOM

product number (MOM identity) that is shown in CPI can be different from the numbers,

which are visible in the nodes.

## 20.3 Updated NR CPI Library Structure Including Merged Libraries, RAN Compute Concept and New Hardware Library

Library structure for NR compared to LTE:

1. The RAN and Baseband Radio Node libraries are merged.
2. Information about hardware is broken out from the baseband Radio Node library and collected in new libraries with information about radio node hardware and site equipment.
3. The RAN Compute concept is introduced. RAN Compute is the radio access processing platform in the Ericsson Radio System, with Baseband units, Digital Units and future RAN Compute products. The Baseband hardware product folder has changed name to RAN Compute.

Figure 29   LTE and NR Libraries Compared

The merged NR RAN library includes the content from the Baseband Radio Node library. The

Baseband Radio Node is a multistandard node and the library is a multistandard library

that supports other RATs than NR. Consequently the NR RAN library has filter options for

RATs.

The hardware libraries are multistandard libraries. In addition to information relevant

for NR, they contain information also for other RATs and products. Consequently, the

hardware libraries have filter options for RATs. The information in the hardware

libraries are not only from the Baseband Radio Node Library, but they merged from

several other libraries. Currently, there are three libraries with the following

content:

- Hardware Antenna System, Battery, Enclosure, Power Radio, RAN Compute
- RBS Series
- Remote Site Management

## 20.4 Introducing Feature Videos in CPI

Feature Videos are complementary product information to the written CPI.

Feature Videos are introduced as part of ERS CPI. The narrated videos are complementary

product information to the written CPI. They explain the benefits and the operation of

the feature in an animated format.

Feature Videos do not affect the written Feature Description CPI in any way, and they do

not contain unique information. Written Feature Description documents still contain

complete information about features.

Feature Videos are created for selected features only.

Feature Videos are available in the respective Feature Description CPI and in the Network

Impact Report CPI as well.

Consider viewing one of the Feature Videos already available by searching for „Feature

Videos" in the current library and look for the video icon:

Figure 30   Feature Video Icon

Finally, please leave us feedback either at Ericsson Play, or by leaving a Note on the

corresponding CPI chapter. Let us know whether you like the videos or not!

## 20.5 NB-IoT Features: New Naming Convention

Previously called Narrowband IoT, the features now follow the new naming convention,

all starting with NB-IoT.

From the current release, features that used to be called Narrowband IoT are

now called NB-IoT. The CPI re-naming follows the product re-naming of these

features.

Feature descriptions, NIR topics and guidelines have all been updated to follow the new

naming convention.

## 20.6 Filter PM Counters

A filtering option is available for counters categorized into PM types, areas, and

scenarios. Use the filters to narrow down the list of counters to a particular use case

of interest.

For PM Counter and MO Class, a free text search option is available. Use the free text

search to narrow down the list of counters to a particular use case of interest by using

text strings.

Figure 1 Counter Filtering

# 21 2019 Q3

## 21.1 Change in the RAN Parameter Recommendations Files

A new strategy takes effect for parameter and feature recommendations.

The RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists file

includes only those attributes for which non-default values are recommended.

The recommendation is to use the default value if the attribute is not listed in the

file.

The change takes effect from the following releases:

- 19.Q2 for NR
- 19.Q3 for LTE

# 22 2019 Q2

# 23 2019 Q1

## 23.1 Restructured Supported Capacity and Configurations document

The Supported Capacity and Configurations document is restructured to enable filtering

for better visibility.

Figure 31   Restructured Supported Capacity and Configurations document

## 23.2 5G Plug-Ins in Separate Library

Information about the 5G Plug-Ins will continue to be included in the LTE RAN CPI library

collection, but some of the information is moved into a, separate, 5G

Plug-Ins library. This library contains documents dedicated to the 5G

Plug-Ins such as value package descriptions, feature descriptions, and some O&amp;M

information. Some information about the plug-ins can be found also in the Baseband Radio

Node library and on the RAN level since the plug-ins are closely associated with the LTE

RAN and node functions. It is recommended to always use the full LTE RAN library

collection when reading about the 5G plug-ins.

The plug-ins initially included in the library are:

- Basic Massive MIMO
- Multi-User MIMO

The features initially included in the library are

- Basic AAS for FDD
- Basic AAS for TDD
- Multi-User MIMO Downlink Layers Extension
- TM9 with AAS FDD

To get access to the 5G Plug-In library, use normal procedures for CPI access

requests.

## 24.1 User Roles in Baseband Radio Nodes Available in Baseband Lists and Delta Lists

For Baseband Radio Node, the Lists and Delta Lists file includes information about user

roles in Baseband Radio Nodes. This information was previously available in Manage

Security, but does no longer contain the role listing information. This way operators

can access delta information about Baseband Radio Node Roles in a quicker and more

structured way.

Figure 33   Baseband Radio Node Roles

## 24.2 Battery Guidelines Changes Title

The document Battery Guidelines, 1/154 43-LZA 701 6009/1 has changed title

to Manage Batteries, 1/154 43-LZA 701 6009/1. The document Manage

Batteries, 1/154 43-LZA 701 6009/1 is mandatory to read when handling

batteries.

## 24.3 Changes in the LTE and Massive IoT Library Collections

Due to enhanced functionality in the new ELEX viewer the LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN

libraries are moved to the same level as the collection. In earlier releases the

collection level was separated from the RAN library, but now there is one level

less.

For more information on how the new Ericsson Library Explorer works, see How to Get Started with Ericsson Library Explorer.

## 25.1 Mixed Mode User Guides Consolidated

The documents Manage Mixed Mode Radio and Manage Mixed Mode Managed

Element are now replaced by a new document called Manage Mixed Mode. All information was preserved in the

document merge and the new document contains everything that was included in the two

original source documents. The information was restructured and reorganized to

accommodate the most common workflow and use cases, which results in a logical,

easy-to-use single source of information for mixed mode management.

## 25.2 Create Your Own Delta Lists for Parameters, Counters, and Alarms

When a network is upgraded to a new software version, information is in high demand about

what is new, updated, or removed regarding the following entities:

- Parameters
- Counters
- PM events
- Alarms

Since each upgrade is unique, from the beginning of 2017, Ericsson provides the

possibility to generate the desired lists and delta lists from an Excel file, called

"Lists and Delta Lists".

There are separate Excel files for Baseband Radio Node and DU Radio Node and they can be

found in the "List Files" folder in the ALEX libraries on RAN and node level.

For more information, see the instructions provided in the Excel files and Manage Lists.

Figure 34   Create Delta Lists for Parameters, Counters, and Alarms

## 25.3 Don't Miss Out On Feature Related Information

The LTE RAN Feature Status document in the LTE RAN

library includes feature and value package identity, release status, license and

activation key, and required software release per feature version.

The document supports script functionality, guiding users on which features, with

corresponding license keys in a LKF should not be activated (Pre-check). It also

supports a check (with an AMOS node log as input) identifying already activated 'not

released' or 'restricted' features that must urgently be deactivated (Post-check).

The scope of the integrated checks is LTE RAN, but for the Baseband Radio Node product,

Mixed Mode Baseband configurations including LTE, LTE+WCDMA, LTE+GSM, LTE+WCDMA+GSM, are

also supported.

These checks provide users with automated methods to determine status on the chosen

feature set, rather than to manually go through feature by feature.

The document has replaced the Basic Feature Overview and Licensed Feature Overview

documents since LTE RAN 17.Q4.

# 26 2018 Q2

## 26.1 Restructured Features and Capacities Folder

The former Features folder is renamed to Features and

Capacities.

The Hardware-Related Capabilities document is introduced to list and

describe hardware-related features and capacities that are available in the ERS.

## 27.1 Cleanup of Outdated Libraries

A new CPI release strategy will be introduced starting with Week 10, 2018 for Maintenance

release libraries. Libraries in the LTE RAN Library Collection and Massive IoT RAN

Library Collection containing outdated information are to be removed.

After Week 10, 2018 only the latest Maintenance release library will be available on CPI

Store.

From the Continuous Delivery releases, only the latest four MTR libraries are kept.

## 27.2 Introduction of Solution Information in CPI

To support customer requirements for solution and end-to-end information on the network,

Ericsson started adding solution information to the LTE RAN CPI information. The

solution information is created from the Evolved IP Network (EIN) solution area

information that features comprehensive, integrated, and verified IP transport solutions

for network operators.

The solution information consists of information types: Descriptions and Guidelines.

The Solution Guidelines were first published in the LTE RAN MTR 18.01. The documents can

be found in the Planning folder in ALEX.

## 27.3 Alarm Information Improvements

The Alarm Operating Instructions (OPI) documents were subject to improvement during 2017.

Many aspects of the documents were improved. Most noticeably, to reduce time to find the

correct remedy, the old alarm tables were replaced by a new table. Each row in the table

shows a combination of the MO and the additional text and has a link to the

corresponding remedy chapter.

## 27.4 Shortcuts to New and Popular Documents

From MTR 18.03, Ericsson introduces shortcuts on the ALEX entry page. This makes it

easier to quickly access our most popular and important documents as well as the new

documents introduced in a RAN release. For example, the Network Impact Report can be

accessed by clicking only once.

## 27.5 Content Rating and Feedback

It was never easier to speak your mind about the information found, or not found, in CPI,

so please do!

A click on the happy face helps us understand which content to promote and a click on the

sad face triggers action to improve the content. Giving some extra information when you

are not satisfied helps a lot.

## 27.6 Introduction of Commercial Product Descriptions

From 17.Q4 Ericsson introduced a new information type called Commercial Product

Descriptions. Each Value Package is described in a dedicated document that also contains

information about the features included in the Value Package. The Commercial Product

Descriptions can be found in the RAN libraries.
