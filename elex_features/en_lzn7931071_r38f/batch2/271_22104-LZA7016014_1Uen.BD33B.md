# 1 Policy-Based Routing Overview

The

Policy-Based Routing feature enables a more fine-grained routing decision compared to

destination-based routing.

Summary

The Policy-Based Routing feature is a supplement to destination-based routing. PBR is used

in cases, where a more specific routing decision is needed.

The PBR routing decision is based on both the source and destination addresses of the IP

packet, while destination-based routing is based on the destination IP address only.

PBR can be deployed both for ingress traffic and for traffic originating from the routers

in the node. Traffic for which PBR does not make a routing decision is routed by

destination-based routing.

The following PBR functions are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6:

- PBR for ingress traffic and traffic originated in an outer router
- PBR for traffic originated in an inner router with IPsec

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

PBR both in the inner and outer router is supported for IPv4 and IPv6 network.

# 3 Feature Operation of Policy-Based Routing

When the PBR is enabled on the router, all packets originating from the router are

evaluated using the PBR rules.

Classification and Routing Decision

When PBR is enabled for ingress traffic, all ingress packets on the interface are

evaluated. When PBR is enabled on the router, all packets originating from the router are

evaluated.

Node internal delivery within the same router has a higher priority than policy routing,

while policy routing has a higher priority than delivery to a locally connected subnet.

This feature provides 64 PBR policies for both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. A routing policy

consists of several routing rules. Each routing rule consists of a set of classification

criteria (source IP address and destination IP address) and a route (a next hop).

Classification criteria can be considered individually, independent of each

other.

In a single PBR policy, the inner next hop to an IPsec tunnel can be mixed with the outer

next hop to an IP address.

When classifying a packet, the list of routing rules is evaluated in rule

priority order. If the packet matches the criteria of a rule, a routing decision is made to

route the packet through the next hop of the rule. If the packet does not match any of the

rules, a destination-based routing decision is made.

Resilience

A rule can have a primary next hop and an optional secondary next hop. When connectivity

loss to the primary next hop is detected, failover takes place to a secondary next

hop.

When connectivity to the primary next hop is reestablished, failback takes place to the

primary next hop.

When connectivity is lost to both primary and secondary next hops, a destination-based

routing decision is made for the traffic flow corresponding to the rule.

A rule for which the next hop refers to an IPsec tunnel interface can have only one next

hop.

Route Availability

The node monitors the availability of each route. The availability of a route with a next

hop address depends on the status of the IPv4 or IPv6 interface over which the next hop

router can be reached. If BFD is enabled, then the following conditions must be fulfilled

for the route to be available:

- The value of the operationalState attribute of the InterfaceIPv4 MO instance must be enabled. If connectivity to the next hop router is monitored with a BFD session, the state of the BFD session is also considered.
- The value of the sessionState attribute of the BfdSessionIPv4 MO instance must be up.

The availability of a route with a next hop reference to an IPsec tunnel interface depends

on the status of the IPsec tunnel interface.

BFD Sessions

Single-hop BFD sessions are supported for policy-based routes, and can be used to monitor

connectivity to next

hop

routers. BFD sessions can monitor end-to-end connectivity of the entire Layer 3 segment to

the next

hop

router, including all the underlying Layer 2 segments. BFD is used to achieve fast failover

times.

# 6 Performance of Policy-Based Routing

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

## Appendix A.c: 25.Q2.0: PBR Cardinality Increase and PBR IPv6 in Outer Router

This feature enhancement enables the Policy-Based Routing functionality for IPv6 in

the outer network.

| Feature Name           | Policy-Based Routing   | Policy-Based Routing   |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|

| Access Type            | NR                     | LTE                    |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional               | Optional               |

Summary and Benefits

PBR for IPv6 enables routing decisions to be made based on the policies set by

network administrators rather than solely relying on the destination IP address.

This feature enhancement gives more possibilities in controlling network

traffic.

By using BFD and additional NextHop MO in routing decisions in

PBR, the automatic failover can be performed if there is a critical network failure.

This improves the IPv6 network resilience.

The number of routing policies is increased to 64. The increase in

the number of PBR policies allows for more granular control of the network-routed

traffic and makes the upper limit less likely to be reached.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following attributes are introduced:

- NextHop.address
- NextHop.adminDistance
- NextHop.bfdMonitoring
- RoutingPolicyIpv6.routingPolicyIngress

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
