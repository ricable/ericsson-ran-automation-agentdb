# 1 NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band Overview

The feature increases SRS (Sounding Reference Signal) capacity from 16 to 32 SRS ports

in each special slot.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature adds support for two SRS symbols in each special slot to increase the capacity to

32 ports in each special slot and in each cell.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Increased availability of SRS resources for allocation
- Doubled port capacity compared to the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band feature
- Three times more port capacity for periodic SRS when the coexistence of periodic and aperiodic SRS is used
- Increased downlink cell throughput

Hardware

The feature is supported for RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 5 and higher,

except for RAN Compute group 5e.

The feature is supported on the following capacity modules:

- Capacity Module B with up to six Mid-Band AAS cells for RAN Compute groups 5 and 6
- Capacity Module A with up to 12 Mid-Band AAS cells for RAN Compute group 5
- Capacity Module 2B with up to 12 Mid-Band AAS cells for RAN Compute group 6

For a single eCPRI link with a capacity of 10.3 Gbps, it is recommended to use the

following carrier bandwidth configurations:

- For AIR 6488 and AIR 6454, it is recommended to configure the total carrier bandwidth to a maximum of 60 MHz.
- For AIR 3239, it is recommended to configure the total carrier bandwidth to a maximum of 120 MHz.

Limitations

The feature only supports TDD uplink-downlink patterns with a length of 10 slots and

a special slot pattern with more than two uplink symbols.

The feature must be enabled in all cells of the gNodeB.

The feature does not support half-band frequency hopping for SRS.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

The NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band feature adds support for two SRS symbols in each

special slot that results in a capacity of 32 ports in each special slot and each

cell.

For more information about advanced beamforming, see Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band.

# 4 Network Impact of NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

The feature increases available SRS (Sounding Reference Signal)

resources.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases the number of supported SRS symbols in each special slot

resulting in a capacity of 32 ports in each special slot and in each cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

The feature uses attributes that control advanced downlink MIMO and the configuration

of SRS (Sounding Reference Signal) in the cell. All the attribute requirements of the

prerequisite Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band feature apply to this

feature.

| NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth          | Affecting  | This attribute allows the configuration of full-band or half-band                                     SRS. If the attribute is set to HALF, half-band                                     SRS is used, which allows the UE to transmit SRS with increased                                     coverage. Full-band SRS uses one uplink OFDM symbol in a special                                     slot, while half-band SRS uses two. The SRS capacity of the cell                                     is the same with both the half-band and the fullband                                     configurations.                                                                       |
| NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity               | Affecting  | The value of the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity                                     attribute must be set to a value based on the selected TDD                                     pattern and the antenna switching capability. The value needs to                                     be high enough that enough slots are available to transmit SRS.                                     For example, UEs with 1TX/4RX capability and a DDDSUUDDDD TDD                                     pattern require that the                                         NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute is set                                     to at least 40 to transmit SRS from all antennas. |

# 7 Activate NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band feature is activated.
- The NRCellDU.advancedDlSuMimoEnabled attribute is set to true.
- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012790 MO instance.

To enable the feature in a cell:

2. Set the NRCellDU.srsCapacityBoostEnabled attribute to true.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.srsCapacityBoostEnabled attribute to false in all NRCellDU instances.
2. Set the FeatureSate.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012790 MO instance.

To disable the feature in a cell:

3. Set the NRCellDU.srsCapacityBoostEnabled attribute to false.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

The NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band feature can be enabled or disabled on a cell level

through setting the NRCellDU.srsCapacityBoostEnabled attribute.

Setting it to true enables the feature, and setting it to false disables it.

The following attribute requirements apply to the NR SRS Capacity Boost Mid-Band

feature:

- The NRCellDU.advancedDlSuMimoEnabled attribute must be set to true.
- The NRCellDU.tddSpecialSlotPattern attribute must be set to a value other than TDD\_SPECIAL\_SLOT\_PATTERN\_02.
- The NRCellDU.tddUlDlPattern attribute must be set to a value other than TDD\_ULDL\_PATTERN\_02.
- If the NRCellDU.srsHoppingBandwidth attribute is set to HALF, the NRCellDU.srsCapacityBoostEnabled attribute must be set to false.
