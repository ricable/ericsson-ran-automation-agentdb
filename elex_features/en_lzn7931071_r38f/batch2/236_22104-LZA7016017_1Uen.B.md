# 1 Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation Overview

The feature introduces support for mixed TDD patterns in downlink carrier aggregation

for Low-Band and Mid-Band.

Summary

The feature enables downlink carrier aggregation with mixed TDD patterns in different

capacity modules. The feature supports the configuration of mixed TDD patterns

across up to three capacity modules. The cells in a capacity module must be

configured with the same TDD pattern. The following TDD patterns are supported in

the SpCell and SCells:

- DDDSUDDSUU with 10:2:2 special slot configuration
- DDDDDDDSUU with 6:4:4 special slot configuration

The SpCell can be TDD or FDD.

The feature requires at least two TDD cells, but the other cells can be FDD.

The feature is supported in NR standalone and EN-DC deployments.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- More flexibility in deployment
- More efficient use of the scattered spectrum

# 2 Dependencies of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature uses E5 link connectivity and at least one of the downlink carrier

aggregation features must be enabled. The feature also has limitations related to cell

characteristics and UE capabilities.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The UE must support the simultaneousRxTxInterbandCaPerBandPair or the

simultaneousRxTxInterBandCa IEs defined in the following 3GPP

standards:

- 3GPP TS 38.306; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Access Capabilities
- 3GPP TS 38.331; NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC) Protocol Specification

# 3 Feature Operation of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature enables the configuration of mixed TDD patterns in downlink carrier

aggregation in different capacity modules across up to three gNodeB-DUs or capacity

modules.

The feature can be deployed in downlink carrier aggregation with two or three component

carriers or as a subset in high-order carrier aggregation features with up to six

component carriers. The feature uses the

simultaneousRxTxInterbandCaPerBandPair and the

simultaneousRxTxInterBandCa IEs to determine if a UE supports carrier

aggregation with different TDD patterns in the band combinations.

Table 3 lists some possible supported duplex

mode combinations along with examples of the supported TDD pattern combinations.

The following mixed TDD patterns are supported in the TDD SpCell and TDD SCells:

- DDDSUDDSUU with 10:2:2 special slot configuration
- DDDDDDDSUU with 6:4:4 special slot configuration

Capacity module one includes the SpCell

The supported duplex mode combinations and supported TDD patterns can be configured

across all combinations of capacity modules and gNodeB-DUs. However, the following

restrictions apply:

- Carriers in the same capacity module must have the same duplex mode.
- Only one capacity module can use FDD duplex mode at a time in a gNodeB-DU. Configuring two capacity modules that use FDD duplex mode in one gNodeB-DU is not possible.
- TDD cells in the same capacity module must be configured with the same TDD pattern.

# 4 Network Impact of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves cell utilization.

Capacity and Performance

The feature provides deployment flexibility through supporting network deployments

with two different TDD patterns on different cells. As a result, cell utilization

might improve, because downlink data transmission is distributed across component

carriers of different TDD patterns.

In sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three

or more component carriers where some or all of them are external, UE throughput

might decrease. The UE throughput decrease occurs by reaching the reservation limits

on the PDCCH and PUCCH.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

Configuration changes are required for additional PUCCH resource

allocation.

Table 4   Parameters

# 6 Performance of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

The performance of the feature can be observed through downlink cell throughput KPIs,

RIs, PIs, and downlink cell volume counters.

- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigMaxSa
- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCellExt
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlPCellCa
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellExt

The following PM counters can be used on DRB-level:

- NRCellDU.pmMacThpDlDrbMax
- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurst
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurst

The following PM counters can be used to observe unrestricted data volume and time

with QoS:

- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurstQoS
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurstQoS

The following PM counters can be used to measure the downlink MAC PDU volume

separately for the serving cells for each UE:

- The NRCellDU.pmMacPduVolDlUePCell PM counter is used for the SpCell.
- The NRCellDU.pmMacPduVolDlUeSCell PM counter is used in any of the configured and activated SCells.

The following EBS-N and EBS counters are associated with the

NRCellDU MO class:

- pmEbsMacRBSymUtilUlCaSCellPartitionDistr
- pmEbsnMacScellDeactivationAttUe
- pmEbsnMacScellScheduleReadyUeDl

The following EBS-N counters associated with the NRCellDU MO

class                 can be used to observe unrestricted data volume and time:

- pmEbsnMacTimeDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurst
- pmEbsnMacTimeDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurstQoS
- pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurst
- pmEbsnMacVolDlDrbSingleSlotShortBurstQoS

The following EBS-N counters associated with the NRCellDU MO

class                 can be used to measure the downlink MAC PDU volume separately for the serving cells

for each UE:

- The pmEbsnMacPduVolDlUePCell EBS counter is used in the SpCell.
- The pmEbsnMacPduVolDlUeSCell EBS counter is used in any of the configured and activated SCells.

The EBS counters can be filtered with any combination of available filters, for

example, to show the downlink MAC PDU volume for each Serving PLMN in the cell. For

more information on the EBS counters, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document.

# 7 Activate Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated in the appropriate MO instance. Additional

PUCCH resource must be allocated in the cell for carrier aggregation to avoid downlink

throughput degradation.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012796 MO instance.
2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to true.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. If the cell is not intended to be used as SpCell for carrier

aggregation, the additional PUCCH allocation must be stopped to avoid PUCCH

overhead.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012796 MO instance.

If the cell is not intended to be used as SpCell for carrier aggregation, do the

following:

2. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
3. Set the NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute to false.
4. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
