# 1 Introduction

This document provides a guideline for collecting troubleshooting data that is to be enclosed

in a Customer Service Request (CSR). A CSR is written when a problem is experienced with the

product. The document provides guidelines on what sort of photographs to take for collecting

troubleshooting data that is to be enclosed in a CSR.

The photographs in this document are only examples. They show the principle of what sort of

photographs should be taken. The actual photographs should focus on the fault that is to be

highlighted. Remember that it is better to take too many photographs than too few.

Take photographs of the following:

1. The site - before taking photographs of the site, obtain permission from the appropriate authority.
2. An overview of the product, for example an RBS, A Radio Unit (RU), an antenna system, or any other product.
3. The faulty HW unit, for example a Digital Unit (DU), an Overvoltage Protection (OVP), an RU, or a cable connector.
4. Optical indicators
5. Label or serial number

The sections below illustrate the sort of photographs that should be taken for the five

points mentioned earlier on List\_Photo.

Consider also the following points when taking photographs:

- The more photographs, the better.
- Make sure that the photographs show details of the fault.
- Take photographs of any other problems that occur related to the fault.
- Take photograph of the behavior of the optical indicator that is related to the fault.
- If a fault is difficult to show from one angle, take photographs from different angles so that a collection of photographs gives a better understanding of the fault.
- Make sure that the lighting is good enough for the quality of the photograph.
- Be observant when using a flash; some surfaces reflect the light from the flash and affect the quality of the photograph.
- Take both a zoomed-in and a zoomed-out photograph of the fault, or problem, that is to be highlighted.
- With zoomed-in photographs, use the camera angle that makes it easy to spot the fault, or problem, that is to be highlighted.

# 2 The Site

The following illustrations are some examples of site photographs. The basic idea is to show what the site looks like; for example:

- The RBS is indoors or outdoors.
- The RBS or the product is on a wall, on a rooftop, or a shelter site.
- The site has a power backup; battery cabinet or a diesel generator, and so on.
- The site landscape
- How the antennas are placed.
- What the surrounding area looks like; for example, if there are buildings in the vicinity, or trees, or any elevations.

| Indoor RBSs        â€“   | RBS Connected to RRUs   |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| RBS on the Wall        | Antenna System          |

# 3 Overview of the Product

The following illustrations are some examples of photographs of the product that are faulty, or products that contain a unit that is faulty. An overview photograph is taken so that the product that contains the fault can be identified.

| RBS with Door Open   |
|----------------------|
| Remote Radio Units   |

# 4 HW Unit

The following illustrations are some examples of photographs of the HW units that are faulty, or suspected of being faulty.

The principle to follow is to take an overview photograph, then a photograph of the next level of detail, and then successively reach the faulty unit level.

For example, if the RF connector is faulty, show the RF cables in the cabinet (1), a zoom-in of the RF cables (2), a zoom-in of the RF connector (3), and a zoom-in of the fault in the connector (4).

| 1. RF Cables in the Cabinet   | 2. A Zoom-in of the RF Cables        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 3. The Faulty RF Connector    | 4. The Fault in the Faulty Connector |

# 5 Optical Indicator

The optical indicator behavior changes over a certain period. When taking photographs of the optical indicator, remember the following:

- Take photographs of the optical indicator at different time intervals over a certain period to show the changes in the optical indicator behavior, if any. Mark the time on the photographs so that the behavior pattern over a certain period can be seen.
- If possible, make a film of the changes in the optical indicator behavior. The advantage of making a film is that if there is a sound connected with the fault in the HW unit, it can also be recorded.

# 6 Label or Serial Number

When taking photographs of the label, make sure to get a photograph of the following labels:

- Label on the RBS
- Label on the faulty unit

The following illustrations are examples of photographs of a label. The information on the label should be visible.

Label 1

Label 2

# 7 Broken Connectors

When taking photographs of broken connectors, show, if possible, one working connector and one faulty connector.

# 8 Breakage

When taking photographs of a breakage, make sure of the following:

- The breakage is clearly visible.
- The unit that contains the breakage is also visible.

The illustration shows an example of the sort of photograph that should be taken to show breakage.

# 9 Cables

The illustration shows some examples of photographs of cables.
