Summary

This

feature allows for improved uplink cell group switching and uplink PDCP aggregation

configuration on the DRB level. Uplink cell group switching and uplink PDCP

aggregation can be

configured

on the UE group level through the UE Grouping Framework

feature.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Customizable properties for uplink cell group switching and uplink PDCP aggregation for each enabled UE group
- Performance impact observability on the UE group level
- Separate configurations for the following parameters: The uplink cell group switching function can be configured for each QCI and 5QI The initial uplink primary path for uplink cell group switching can be selected based on the PSCell coverage in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments The uplink PDCP aggregation function can be configured for each QCI and 5QI The uplink PDCP aggregation threshold can be differentiated when uplink coverage quality is low and the primary path is SCG Low quality threshold for the uplink radio quality SINR measurement Low quality hysteresis for the uplink radio quality SINR measurement
- Customizable optimization for the following aspects of performance: Improved coverage Maximized throughput Reduced latency Stable latency

## 3.3 Latency-Prioritized Scheduling Overview

The feature introduces a scheduling algorithm based on packet age, mainly for

delay-sensitive services. The feature also allows for dynamic shifting between demoted and

elevated priorities for QoS flows based on packet delay.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature introduces a scheduling algorithm that increases the scheduling weight with the

age of the oldest Radio Link Control (RLC) packet. The age of the RLC packet

determines the increase in scheduling weight. In downlink, the gNodeB calculates the

age of the RLC packet. In uplink, the gNodeB estimates the age of the RLC

packet.

The feature can be used for QoS flows with a configured RAN PDB that is greater than

or equal to 30 ms.

When the RLC packet is older than the age threshold defined as the difference between RAN PDB

and a priority shift margin through the

DlLatencyBasedPriority.dlPriorityShiftMargin or the

UlLatencyBasedPriority.ulPriorityShiftMargin attributes, the

feature is allowed to elevate the priority domain. The smallest priority shift

threshold that can be configured is the duration of the RAN PDB.

The elevated priority domain is determined based on the priority level configured through the

DU5qi.priorityLevel or the

DUModified5qiUeCfg.priorityLevel and the

QosPriorityMapping.priorityDomainMapping attributes.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Allows more packets to meet the delay requirement for data flows with different delay requirements
- Allows resource control to prevent excessive resource consumption by UEs with elevated scheduling weights in case of resource contention

The feature can be configured per QoS flow and it supports network slicing and UE grouping

framework.
