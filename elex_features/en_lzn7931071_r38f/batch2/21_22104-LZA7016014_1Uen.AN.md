Summary

The Cascaded RET Support enables the operator to control and optimize the coverage area by

modifying the inclination of installed antennas remotely. The feature connects a

number of RET units to the same multidrop bus, and the antennas are controlled over

the antenna interface on one radio unit.

Cascaded RET units provide means to add tilting capability for antennas at co-sited base

stations without support for RET control.

The Cascaded RET Support feature is supported by AISG 3.0.

# 3 Feature Operation of Cascaded RET Support

Cascaded RET Support is a basic feature available for 3GPP Iuant-compliant RET units.

Cascading can be used for several reasons, for example:

- Any specific configuration where cascading is necessary to control all antennas on a site.
- To adjust the antenna in a co-sited RBS belonging to a different RAN.
- To control more than one RETs inside an AIR unit from a single RBS. Note: The RET control in the AIR unit is described in Manage Hardware Equipment.

Cascaded RET units are connected over an RS-485 multidrop bus. Due to the multidrop

configuration one or more faulty units on the bus do not cause failure on the remaining RET

units.

The modeling of the cascaded RET units is based on how several

AntennaNearUnit MOs are sharing one antenna port on a radio unit. The

antenna port is identified by the AntennaNearUnit.rfPortRef parameter.

One antenna port supports a maximum of 6 physical RET units, due to power limitations. The

number of physical RET units can be further limited by the power configuration of the antenna

port and the allowance of the DC power supply in the antenna system.

A physical RET unit can contain one or multiple tilt functions. The interface supports up to

48 tilt functions that are addressed using AntennaNearUnit.uniqueId

parameters. One parameter is assigned to each tilt function. Depending on the RET hardware

used, the AntennaNearUnit MOs can be configured with only one

RetSubUnit MO, or grouping maximum 12 RetSubUnit

MOs.

The various RET configurations (with or without a TMA or RIU) are described in RET Support.

Figure 1 shows an omni cell configured

with three antennas controlled by cascaded RET units.

Figure 1   Cascaded RET Configuration in One RBS, using a TMA

Figure 2 shows an LTE RBS co-sited with a GSM RBS. The

feeders originally for the GSM RBS are shared with LTE using diplex filters. RET capability is

introduced for the GSM antenna and the LTE RBS controls and supervises the operation using

cascaded RET units.

Figure 2   Cascaded RET Configuration with GSM and LTE Co-sited

The AISG device scan procedure helps to find the AntennaNearUnit.uniqueId

parameters. It is achieved by scanning all the RF and RET ports in the RBS and listing all the

available AISG units with their unique hardware IDs. For more information about the device

scan procedure, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

# 4 Parameters of Cascaded RET Support

Cascaded RET Support introduces a new parameter that supports identification of advanced

antenna system configurations.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                | Type       | Description          |
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| AntennaNearUnit.uniqueId | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 5 Network Impact of Cascaded RET Support

The operation of Cascaded RET Support impacts cell capacity and

performance.

Capacity and Performance

A changed vertical angle on the antenna lobe affects the cell coverage and

interference between cells. Cascaded RET Support increases the number of controlled

antennas. This gives increased flexibility to tune both the network and other radio

access networks with co-sited base stations lacking the RET control capability.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Cascaded RET Support

The Cascaded RET Support feature has no associated KPIs, Counters, or

Events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Cascaded RET Support

The Engineering Guidelines for Cascaded RET Support describes the individual queue

handling for available RET operations.

## 8.1 RET Operations

The power consumption in a physical RET unit increases during the following

operations:

- Tilt Setup
- Calibration
- Self Test

To prevent an overload of the DC power supply in the radio unit, the RBS performs

individual queue handling for each operation on cascaded physical RET units.

| Operation   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tilt Setup  | Setting a new tilt angle for 48 cascaded tilt functions in bulk                                     takes approximately 1.5 minutes for each tilt function in the                                     cascade.  |
| Calibration | Calibrating 48 cascaded tilt functions in bulk takes                                     approximately 2.5 minutes for each tilt function in the                                     cascade.                   |
| Self Test   | Self testing 48 cascaded tilt functions in bulk takes                                     approximately six minutes before the last tilt function in the                                     cascade is tested. |

Configuring the cascade chain and generic RET configurations (for example, adding and

deleting a tilt function, changing the tilt, initiating a self test) are described in

Manage Hardware Equipment.

Faults reported by Iuant-compliant physical RET units are handled by the system and

reported to the operator as alarms and change in status. General fault management

activities are described in Manage Faults.
