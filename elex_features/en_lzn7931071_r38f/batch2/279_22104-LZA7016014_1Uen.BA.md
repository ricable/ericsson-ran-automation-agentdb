Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

- G.8275.1 Telecom profile for time synchronization requires that the sync network is a "full on path support" PTP network. This means that there must be PTP Boundary or Transparent Clocks in every network element between the PTP Grand Master and the PTP Slave.
- The G.8275.1 profile allows up to 250 nanoseconds of PDV. Selecting this profile requires that the PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -4, to represent 16 packets per second.
- The IEEE\_1588\_J3 profile allows higher PDV than G.8275.1. For PDV up to 250 nanoseconds, the recovered clock accuracy is the same as for G.8275.1. If the sync message rate is at least 64 packets per second, then PDV up to 100 microseconds is tolerated, but the recovered clock accuracy deteriorates and the locking time is increased up to 90 minutes, which can impact the time features on the node.
- Avoid using 1000BASE-T SFP modules that typically come with a RJ45 connector. These SFP modules can cause PDV to exceed the node PDV tolerance limit, which results in disabled synchronization references. For 1000BASE-T connections, the recommendation is to use RJ45 connectors on the front side of the unit. Alternatively use SFP-DAC cables.

# 3 Feature Operation of IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock

The Boundary Clock uses PTP over Ethernet Multicast to set the

RadioEquipmentClock time both for internal node use and to distribute

its time synchronization reference to adjacent nodes.

If the node has an operational GNSS receiver connected, the Boundary Clock uses the time

synchronization reference from GNSS. If the GNSS time synchronization reference is down,

the Boundary Clock uses the Best Master Clock (BMC) Algorithm to select the best PTP

source. If there is no GNSS receiver configured, the Boundary Clock uses the BMC

Algorithm only. If GNSS fails, the following criteria has to be fulfilled for automatic

time synchronization with increased reliability:

- PTP over Ethernet enabled subnetwork.
- Boundary Clocks enabled on all nodes.
- At least two GNSS receivers connected.

PTP packets are sent untagged over Ethernet, or tagged over

VLAN between nodes and the PTP grandmaster.

The feature can operate in G.8275.1 telecom profile or the IEEE1588 Appendix J3 default

profile. It needs to have at least two PTP ports configured, a primary and a secondary

port. But typically it is configured with multiple PTP ports, where the ports are in the

following states:

- PTP Best Master Clock Algorithm selects one port to be in SLAVE state, if there is a PTP Grandmaster available in the network.
- Other ports enter MASTER or PASSIVE state, depending on the profile used.

# 4 Network Impact of IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock

In the typical network running PTP Time Synchronization, the activation of this

feature improves the time accuracy in the network. If the IEEE\_1588\_TIME\_SLOW profile is

set, startup time can be prolonged to up to 90 minutes.

Capacity and Performance

The activation of this feature improves the time accuracy in the network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Events

# 7 Activate IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) is activated since at least one week. This ensures there is troubleshooting data available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance: Node Type License Control MO Baseband Radio Node FeatureState=CXC4040018

After This Task

Let the CCTR be active for one week, for continued collection of troubleshooting

data.

# 8 Deactivate IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) is activated since at least one week. This

ensures there is troubleshooting data available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance: Node Type License Control MO Baseband Radio Node FeatureState=CXC4040018

After This Task

Let the CCTR be active for one week, for continued collection of troubleshooting

data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock

The IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock feature needs to be configured for optimal

operation.

The IEEEE\_1588\_TIME\_DEFAULT profile allows a packet rate of 8, 16, or 32 event packets

per second. This profile allows up to 250 nanoseconds of PDV, and the recovered clock

accuracy is the same as for G.8275.1. Selecting this profile requires the following

configuration:

- The PtpBcOcPort.ptpMulticastAddress attribute is set according to network planning.
- The PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -3, to represent 8 packets per second.
- The PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -4, to represent 16 packets per second.
- The PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -5, to represent 32 packets per second.

The IEEEE\_1588\_TIME\_SLOW profile allows a packet rate of 64 or 128 event packets per

second with the ability to work in networks with high PDV, that is, PDV up to 100

microseconds. This profile deteriorates the recovered clock accuracy and increases the

locking time up to 90 minutes, which can impact the time features on the node. Selecting

this profile requires the following configuration:

- The PtpBcOcPort.ptpMulticastAddress attribute is set according to network planning.
- The PtpBcOcPort.syncMessageInterval attribute is set to -6, to represent 64 packets per second.

When PTP over Ethernet is to be used on an Ethernet port that is part of LAG, make sure

to configure PTP on the same Ethernet link in both ends.

If PTP over VLAN is used:

- The tnPortId attribute of the TnPort MO indicates that a TN or an IDLe port is used for the VLAN.
- If a TN port is used, check that a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO refers to the VlanPort MO. To determine if a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO has to be used, refer to the transport network or the IP address plan. If the transport network or the IP address plan does not have any Bridge, InterfaceIPv4, or InterfaceIPv6 MO recommendations, create a Bridge MO.
- If an IDLe port is used, check that an ENodeBFunction MO instance is available, and the eranVlanPortRef attribute refers to the same VlanPort MO instance as the PtpBcOcPort MO does. The operState attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO must be set to ENABLED before configuring the PtpBcOcPort MO that points to the same VlanPort MO instance.

## Appendix A.b: PTP Source Instability Indication

| Access Type:       | LTE                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

| Belongs to:        | Time and Phase Synchronization, FAJ 801 0439      |

PTP Source Instability Indication is an enhancement of the 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization

feature. This enhancement introduces additional supervision of fast phase changes,

covering the currently selected PTP time reference. Other time references are not

supervised by this feature.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

When fast phase changes are detected twice in a time frame of 30 minutes, the selected PTP

reference is considered faulty and the Sync PTP Time PDV

Problem alarm is raised. If there is a backup frequency reference

on the node, it will maintain Time Holdover until it expires, and then switch to the

backup frequency reference.

This feature

introduces support for carrying  PTP packets over VLAN tagged

Ethernet.

The enhancement includes configuration parameters to enable or disable VLAN tagging.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The new MO

attribute, transportVlan is implemented to configure the VLAN ID

for each PTP port.

The tnPortId, attribute of the

TnPort MO indicates that a TN or an IDLe port is used for the

VLAN.

- When a TN port is used, a Bridge, an InterfaceIPv4, or an InterfaceIPv6 MO has to refer to the VlanPort MO.
- When an IDLe port is used, an ENodeBFunction MO instance has to be available, and the eranVlanPortRef attribute must refer to the same VlanPort MO instance as the PtpBcOcPort MO does. The operState attribute of the EranInterMeLink MO must be set to ENABLED before configuring the PtpBcOcPort MO that points to the same VlanPort MO instance.

Other Network Elements

VLAN tagged PTP messages are not supported by some third-party Grandmaster clocks.

Towards such clocks, untagged Ethernet can still be used.

Third-party boundary clocks also need to support PTP with VLAN tagging.
