Summary

The feature allows for building multistandard configurations spanning over multiple RBS

cabinets. For example, when deploying LTE inter-band carrier aggregation, where the

radio units of the different frequency bands are distributed over multiple macro RBS

cabinets.

This feature also provides the following benefits:

- Support for long distance between cabinets
- Individual climate control and power solution for each RBS cabinet
- External alarms collected from all RBS cabinets
- Support for RBS cabinets, without a DU or Baseband together with Baseband R503
- The equipment view in the OSS that presents a view of the cabinet and the equipment installed in it
- Support for one or multiple primary nodes in a multicabinet configuration

Hardware

A DU or a Baseband unit in one cabinet can connect to the support system hub unit

through one of the following ways:

- Using the EC bus to connect the DU or Baseband unit to the local support system hub unit
- Using a Baseband R503 or IRU to connect the DU or Baseband unit to the remote support system hub unit in another cabinet

The Ericsson micro USB to RJ-45 converter must be used for the connection between the

Baseband R503 and the support system hub unit.

For a Baseband unit without EC bus port, the Baseband unit can connect to the support

system hub unit using a Baseband R503 or IRU. If a Baseband R503 is not available, a

Controller 6610 unit must be used to control the cabinet and support system

configuration.

Limitations

The third splitter port on Baseband R503 cannot be used for multicabinet

communication.

The following limitations apply for WCDMA nodes if using a Baseband R503:

- A GSM DU Radio node in a multicabinet cluster can only be configured as a node with a secondary support system role.
- GSM nodes can only take a secondary support system role towards one node with a primary support system role.
- GSM nodes cannot take multiple roles.

Network Requirements

The Multicabinet Control feature is licensed for each RBS cluster.

One primary node can control the support system units in                                     several cabinets. |

# 3 Feature Operation of Multicabinet Control

The feature is used to expand existing, installed sites.

The feature allows a Radio Node to share radio units with another node in a multicabinet

configuration. The DU or Baseband unit is connected to the Baseband R503 in the other cabinet

through optical CPRI links. This results in the increased use of radio units without

relocation of radio resources. Up to seven cabinets can be used in a multicabinet

configuration.

Figure 1   Example of RBS Configurations over Two RBS Cabinets (Baseband Unit with EC Bus

Port)

Figure 2   Example of RBS Configurations over Two RBS Cabinets (Baseband Unit without EC Bus

Port)

The communication to the second cabinet can only be established by connecting the CPRI link

to either of the following units:

- A primary role DU or Baseband unit
- A secondary role DU or Baseband unit

When the CPRI link connection is lost, the support system cannot switch to any other

available CPRI link towards Baseband R503.

There can be one or more primary role nodes in a multicabinet configuration as each cabinet

can have a separate primary role node. Each primary role node controls its own support system.

One primary role node can control the support system units in several cabinets. One secondary

role node can be connected to up to seven primary role nodes.

For more information about this configuration, see Radio

Dot System.

## 3.1 Network Management

Radio access systems are configured separately, but some coordination is

needed.

Each installed radio access system is managed separately from the OSS. The standards are seen

as separate nodes and are configured separately. For more information, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

The radio access systems are seen as separate nodes and are configured separately. For nodes

in the same cabinet the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute must be

set to the same value.

## 3.2 Radio Configurations

Each node in a multicabinet configuration has a separate radio configuration, even if

there are shared radio units.

Mixed Mode sectors are configured in both nodes by selecting a RBB which supports shared

radio units. For more information about radio configurations, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide

and Radio Node Configurations.

## 3.3 Support System and Control

Multicabinet configurations have at least one node acting as primary system

support.

If two or more nodes are installed in the same multicabinet cluster, at least one of them

takes the primary support system role. It is not obligatory to have more than one node with a

primary support system role. There can be multiple nodes with a primary support system role,

so power and climate control are decentralized to multiple cabinets.

A node can have multiple roles. A node can take both a primary support system role and a

secondary support system role. If a node takes multiple roles, the roles must be reversed.

Once the roles are established, they must stay the same.

The feature demands that a node with primary support system role can establish a connection

to all cabinets, which means connection to support system units. It can go through any of the

following connections:

- Units that provide EC bus connectivity, for example a Baseband R503 or an IRU
- Stretching a physical EC bus between cabinets

An example of such configurations is connectivity between an RBS and power cabinets. For

information about how to connect an enclosure and power cabinets, see Non-RF Connections.

The following limitations apply for WCDMA nodes if using a Baseband R503:

- A GSM DU Radio node in a multicabinet cluster can only be configured as a node with a secondary support system role.
- GSM nodes can only take a secondary support system role towards one node with a primary support system role.
- GSM nodes cannot take multiple roles.

The functions are available for WCDMA nodes using an IRU.

For more information about nodes with primary and secondary support system roles, see

Manage Hardware Equipment.

## 3.4 Cabling

The third splitter port on Baseband R503 cannot be used for multicabinet

communication.

For more information on cabling and connections, see Antenna and RF Connections and Non-RF

Connections.

## 3.5 Power Distribution Setting

Units must be secured to remain operational during battery backup.

Units must be secured to remain operational when the voltage level Main

load disconnect is reached during battery backup. In AC-powered

cabinets, the following units must be set as priority load to secure them:

- Baseband units
- DU
- SCU
- Interconnection units that provide EC bus connection, for example Baseband R503 or IRU.

For more information about PCR setting, see PDU Description.

## 3.6 Radio Fault Handling

When an error occurs in a radio unit, it sends fault indications to all connected radio

units.

For more information about radio fault handling, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

## 3.7 Synchronization

For RBS nodes with sectors running in Mixed Mode, the system clock in the LTE node must

be synchronized with the system clock in the node sharing its radio units.

For ways to synchronize the LTE node system clock with the system clock in the node sharing

its radio units, and for the related parameters, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Multicabinet Control

Expansion, alarm reporting, and observability are aspects of multicabinet control that

have to be considered from an engineering perspective.

## 9.1 Expansion to Multicabinet Control

The Multicabinet Control feature allows for two existing RBS cabinets to be expanded

into one cluster.

The main activities for the expansion of two existing installed RBS cabinets into one cluster

using the multicabinet control feature is described in

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

## 9.2 Multicabinet Information Observability

The RBS Element Manager is used to view multicabinet information.

The OMT in GSM is not able to view any multicabinet information.

The RBS Element Manager in LTE and WCDMA shows whether a cabinet is configured for

multicabinet control, using the multicabinet parameters.

The number of cabinets shown in the RBS layout and the Antenna layout varies depending on the

current configuration. Information about multicabinet control visibility from OSS can be found

in the applicable OSS CPI.

For more information, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

Parameters for Multicabinet Control

## 9.3 Alarm Configuration and Reporting

Most multicabinet configuration alarms are reported by and are controlled from the

primary node.

In a multicabinet configuration, the primary node reports all alarms related to the support

system, except the Inconsistent Configuration alarm which is raised on the secondary role

node. All alarms that are raised are visible for each cabinet and can be handled in multiple

instances for the cluster, depending on the object.

External alarm ports are available in the cabinet where the primary role node is located and

they are only possible to administrate, control and configure from there. The secondary role

node can mirror alarm changes on the AlarmPort MOs in the primary role node

it is connected to. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q2: Multicabinet Control: Support for Seven Cabinets

The Multicabinet Control feature enhancement supports multistandard configurations with

RBS cabinets. The enhancement also enables fault handling.

| Feature Name:           | Multicabinet Control   |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R3        |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R7        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node    |
| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM        |

This feature supports multistandard configurations spanning over multiple RBS cabinets, for

instance when deploying LTE Inter-Band Carrier Aggregation, where the radio units of the

different frequency bands are distributed over multiple macro RBS cabinets.

The maximum number of supported cabinets is seven, regardless of cabinet type.

The enhancement also introduces fault handling: it is possible to detect an incorrect

configuration where several nodes are configured as the primary node.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 17.Q4: Multi Cabinet Solution, Support for Multiple Roles

The enhancement introduces the possibility for nodes to have multiple support system roles in a multi cabinet cluster.

| Feature Name:           | Multi Cabinet Control              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R4                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R9                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM                    |

The enhancement introduces the possibility for nodes to have multiple support system roles in a

multi cabinet cluster. A node can have a primary role and a secondary role, and act as a

primary role node and secondary role node at the same time. However, there can only be

one primary role node in each multi cabinet cluster. The introduction of multiple role

nodes enables the creation of large multi cabinet solutions, and the expansion or

rebuilding of sites by using existing equipment in a flexible way.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The enhancement introduces a second instance of MO

EquipmentSupportFunction to be able to support a multiple

role node. If the node is a multiple role node, the roles indicated by the

supportSystemControl attribute on the

EquipmentSupportFunction MO instances have to be

different.

The following new attributes are introduced, as well:

- Attribute equipmentSupportFunctionRef in MO EcBus
- Attribute equipmentSupportFunctionRef in MO ExternalNode
- Attribute reservedBy in MO EquipmentSupportFunction

New additional text is added to the Inconsistent

Configuration alarm, due to the second instance of the

EquipmentSupportFunction MO.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Support for the new MO instance and attributes introduced by this enhancement.

The required support is automatically implemented, no operator action is needed.

## Appendix A.c: 17.Q4: Multicabinet: Several Primary Role Nodes

The enhancement allows a more flexible way of building a multicabinet configuration and the operator can easily expand the configuration without expanding the footprint.

| Feature Name:           | Multi Cabinet Control              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R4                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R9                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM                    |

The enhancement allows the configuration of up to seven primary role nodes connected to a

secondary role node in a multicabinet configuration where each primary role node

controls its own support system and the secondary role node is either an LTE DU Radio

Node or a Baseband Radio Node. This allows a more flexible way of building a

multicabinet configuration and the operator can easily expand the configuration without

expanding the footprint. The enhancement also improves redundancy and fault behavior as

climate control is handled locally by a primary role node.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Climate Inconsistent Configuration alarm is introduced on MO

EquipmentSupportfinction with a new additional text. For more

information see Climate Inconsistent Configuration.

A child EcPort MO can be created under the AuxPlugInUnit

MO, where this configuration represents a Baseband R unit in a secondary role node

terminated to the hub of a primary role node allowing communication from the

secondary role node to a primary role node.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node required support from the following network

elements:

- Equipment Configuration Tool Update to an Equipment Configuration Tool version that supports configuration of one secondary role node connected to multiple primary role nodes.

## Appendix A.d: 18.Q3: Multicabinet Control: Improved Connectivity

This improvement enables two MEs to share a remote cabinet.

| Feature Name:           | Multicabinet Control               |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R5                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 121 4629 R12                   |
| Node Type:              | DU Radio Node, Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA                         |

Digital Unit and Baseband Unit are not mandatory in the shared cabinet.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

A new ExternalNode.inciConnectorRef attribute is introduced to refer to a

shared unit (FieldReplaceableUnit or

AuxPlugInUnit MO) that can provide inter-node connectivity

between two MEs. The CPRI link connected to the shared unit is used by both the

primary and secondary MEs. This attribute is mandatory to configure on both

sides.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

DU and Baseband units with CPRI and EC-port capability.

Other Network Elements
