Summary

This feature allows downlink carrier aggregation with six component carriers in Low-Band and

Mid-Band among up to three Advanced RAN Coordination partners. The Advanced RAN

Coordination partners, which are either gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules, are

connected by an E5 link through the Advanced RAN Coordination feature.

The feature supports the maximum aggregated bandwidth UE is capable for all Low-Band and

Mid-Band downlink carrier aggregation features according to the following

standards:

- BCS5
- 3GPP Release 17

This feature has the following benefits:

- Increased downlink peak throughput
- More efficient use of scattered spectrum

# 2 Dependencies of NR 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation

This feature uses the Advanced RAN Coordination feature for carrier aggregation

between gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules. The performance is limited by UE capabilities and

cell configurations.

Hardware

RAN Compute groups 4, 5, and 6 can be used as both PCell and SCell.

Limitations

- For FDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 900 μs.
- For TDD PCell configuration, the maximum RTT delay that is supported between two Advanced RAN Coordination partners is 350 μs.
- Only NR standalone deployment is supported.
- For TDD-TDD carrier aggregation, the PCell and SCell must have the same TDD patterns.
- The feature is not supported where the PCell has 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured and the SCells have more than 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured.
- UE throughput might decrease in sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three or more component carriers due to reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH. This is also valid when some or all the component carriers are external.
- When a UE is configured with 6CC downlink carrier aggregation and 2CC uplink carrier aggregation, and the PCell is a TDD cell with a DDDSU pattern, the software on the node hosting the second uplink SCell must be 24.Q4 or newer.
- Peak throughput is achievable up to an aggregated bandwidth of 340 MHz.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

## 2.1 Downlink Carrier Aggregation Features in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The NR downlink carrier aggregation features in Low-Band and Mid-Band use the same

SCell selection algorithm.

If a carrier aggregation feature with a higher number of component carriers is enabled,

the carrier aggregation features with a lower number of component carriers are also

enabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature allows the aggregation of six component carriers among up to three

gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules. The Advanced RAN Coordination feature provides the E5 link

connectivity between the gNodeB-DUs or capacity modules.

The UE connects to the PCell at the gNodeB, which triggers the execution of the SCell

selection function. If possible, the carrier aggregation-capable UE is configured with

four downlink SCells. The selected SCells are configured and activated. For more

information, see NR DL Carrier Aggregation feature.

Table 3   Supported Duplex Mode Combinations

| PCell   |   Number of TDD SCells |   Number of FDD SCells |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| TDD     |                      1 |                      4 |
| TDD     |                      2 |                      3 |
| FDD     |                      2 |                      3 |
| FDD     |                      3 |                      2 |

All configurations of capacity modules and gNodeBs are possible for the supported duplex

mode combinations. However, the following restrictions apply:

- Carriers in the same capacity module must have the same duplex mode.
- Only one capacity module can use FDD duplex mode at a time in a gNodeB. Configuring two capacity modules that use FDD duplex mode in one gNodeB is not possible.

# 4 Network Impact of NR 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature improves cell utilization and increases UE downlink

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cell utilization is expected to improve because downlink data transmission is

distributed across multiple component carriers. UE downlink throughput is increased

by aggregating six component carriers.

In sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three

or more component carriers, either some or all external, UE throughput might

decrease by reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following interfaces to ensure that multiple SCells can be

configured at the same time:

- Uu interface The size of the RRC RRCReconfiguration message increases.
- F1 interface The size of the UE Context Modification message increases.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The feature has no associated parameters.

There are no introduced, affecting, or affected parameters associated with this

feature.

# 6 Performance of NR 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation

The performance of this feature can be observed through downlink cell throughput KPIs

and downlink cell volume counters.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces additional duplex mode combinations for six

component carries with three FDD cells or carriers and three TDD cells or carriers.

These additional duplex mode combinations can be configured across up to three

capacity modules where the PCell can be TDD or FDD.

The feature enhancement introduces support for the maximum aggregated bandwidth UE

capabilities for all Low-Band and Mid-Band downlink carrier aggregation features

according to the following standards:

- BCS5
- 3GPP Release 17

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Increased flexibility of NR RAN deployment
- More efficient use of scattered spectrum

Capacity and Performance

With this feature enhancement downlink throughput might increase depending on data

traffic.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

RAN Compute units in RAN Compute groups 4, 5, and 6 can be used as both PCell and

SCell.

Other Network Elements

The UE must support capabilities defined in 3GPP Release 17 and

BCS5.
