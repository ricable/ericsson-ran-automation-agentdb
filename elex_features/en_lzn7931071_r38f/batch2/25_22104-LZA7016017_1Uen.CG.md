Summary

The purpose of the EPS Fallback for IMS Voice feature is to transfer an NR-capable UE to an

LTE connection when a voice call is made.

A UE can make an IMS voice call when connected to NR in SA mode. It is redirected to LTE with

the help of either the Release with Redirect, or the handover mechanism.

For more information on the Release with Redirect and the handover mechanisms, see NR Mobility.

The feature offers the benefit of allowing the UE to fall back to LTE for voice call in NR

SA.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

If no PDU session exists when the 5QI=1 flow is received during the

initial context setup process and the PDU session resource setup process, a blind

release with redirect is performed. In this case, the

McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is

ignored.

Network Requirements

The feature requires the EPC and the 5GC to support the N26 interface. The N26

interface ensures that call continuation in LTE can be achieved.

# 3 Feature Operation of EPS Fallback for IMS Voice

The EPS Fallback for IMS Voice feature involves the NGAP procedure PDU Session Resource

Modify.

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, the EPS Fallback for IMS

Voice feature involves the PDU Session Resource Setup and Initial Context Setup

procedures. For more information on the activation of the Fallback Handling at Session

Setup feature, see Fallback Handling at Session Setup.

These procedures monitor if a voice call is being set up. It checks if a new QoS flow is

requested with 5QI = 1 (conversational voice). In this case, the gNodeB replies to the

AMF with EPS fallback, and the UE is redirected to LTE. AMF sets up the voice bearer in

LTE for the continuation of the call.

Figure 1   EPS Fallback for IMS Voice with PDU Session Resource Modify

Conditions of EPS Fallback for Non-Emergency IMS Voice Services

The EPS fallback for non-emergency IMS voice services is attempted if one of the

following conditions is fulfilled:

- The possibility of an EPS fallback is indicated in the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE received from the core network.
- The Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE is not indicated from the core network and the Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible attribute is set to true.

If none of the conditions is fulfilled, the UE is released to idle mode.

For more information on the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE, see

3GPP TS 38.413.

EPS Fallback for Non-Emergency IMS Voice Services with Measurement-Based

Handover

If a new QoS flow is requested with 5QI=1 for non-emergency voice services, the

gNodeB replies to the AMF with EPS fallback and starts the measurement procedure.

According to the EPS fallback operation type, either the handover procedure starts

to the reported target eNodeB, or the gNodeB performs release with redirection

procedure to the reported E-UTRA frequency.

This function provides two methods for EPS fallback for non-emergency IMS voice

services:

- Measurement-based release with redirection
- Measurement-based handover

These two methods are more accurate and provide a higher success rate than the

non-measurement-based EPS fallback because of the B1 measurements.

With these methods, it is possible to prioritize between the neighboring E-UTRA

frequencies to use for handover and release with redirection for EPS fallback.

If the operator configures more than one frequency to have the highest priority,

measurement-based handover and release with redirection can measure more than one

E-UTRA frequency.

EPS Fallback Priority During Xn Handover Preparation

It is possible to configure the gNodeB to prioritize EPS fallback over Xn handover

preparation by setting the

McfbCellProfile.epsFallbackPrioritization attribute to

PRIO\_OVER\_XN\_HO.

If a PDU Session Resource Modify Request message to add QoS flow with 5QI = 1 is

received during preparation for Xn handover and if all conditions are fulfilled, the

handover is canceled and EPS fallback by blind release with redirect is

performed.

EPS fallback for voice calls is prioritized over the Xn handover, if conditions for

EPS fallback are fulfilled and one of the following conditions is also

fulfilled:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is set to one of the following values: FORCED FORCED\_MEAS\_RWR FORCED\_MEAS\_IRAT\_HO
- The UE is not VoNR capable and the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is set to one of the following values: ACTIVE ACTIVE\_MEAS\_RWR ACTIVE\_MEAS\_IRAT\_HO

## 3.1 EPS Fallback with Fallback Handling at Session Setup Activated

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, EPS Fallback can be

triggered at session setup.

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, the EPS Fallback for IMS

Voice feature involves the PDU Session Resource Setup and Initial Context Setup

procedures besides the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure.

If the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature is activated, one of the following

messages can trigger the EPS Fallback procedure:

- NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST with included 5QI=1 flow
- NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST with included 5QI=1 flow

For more information on the activation of the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature,

see Fallback Handling at Session Setup.

When the AMF instructs the gNodeB to establish a PDU session that includes the 5QI=1

flow, the EPS Fallback for IMS Voice feature proceeds as follows:

1. The gNodeB sends the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE or the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message to the 5GC with the cause IMS voice EPS fallback or RAT fallback triggered.
2. The gNodeB selects the E-UTRA target frequency.
3. The gNodeB initiates the release of the UE.

## 3.2 Supported Measurement Trigger Quantities for EPS Fallback

RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR can be configured as the trigger quantity for the measurements

used by this feature.

The measurements used by this feature

are

based on one of the following trigger quantities:

- RSRP
- RSRQ
- SINR

The trigger quantity for measurements used by this feature can be configured through the

McfbCellProfileUeCfg.triggerQuantity

attribute.

The

measurements used by the feature can be configured through the following attributes that

correspond to the chosen trigger quantity:

- McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCellCandidate
- McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpCriticalCoverage
- McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCellCandidate
- McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqCriticalCoverage
- McfbCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCellCandidate
- McfbCellProfileUeCfg.sinrCriticalCoverage

## 3.3 Supported Measurement Gap Patterns for EPS Fallback

The gap pattern used for EPS fallback measurements is determined by the measurement

gap lengths that apply to the measurement.

Table 3   Supported Gap Patterns for EPS Fallback Measurements

|   Gap Pattern ID | Measurement Gap Length   | Measurement Gap Repetition Period   | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                0 | 6 ms                     | 40 ms                               | This measurement gap pattern is used for EPS fallback measurements if                                 the conditions for a 3-ms measurement gap length are not met. |
|                2 | 3 ms                     | 40 ms                               | This measurement gap pattern is used for EPS fallback measurements if                                 the conditions for a 3-ms measurement gap length are met.     |

Measurements use a 3 ms measurement gap if the following

conditions are all met:

- The GNBDUFunction.measGapLengthMode attribute is set to a value that enables a 3 ms measurement gap for the measurement.
- The UE indicates support for 3 ms measurement gaps in the supportedGapPattern UE capability.
- The placement of the 3 ms measurement gap length allows the UE to measure LTE synchronization signals.
- The SFN of the source cell must be aligned with the SFN of the target cells. Note: If the SFN of the source cell and the SFN of the target cells are not aligned, the GNBDUFunction.measGapLengthMode attribute is recommended to be set to one of the following values: NR\_FR1\_3MS OFF

If the measurement cannot be configured with a 3 ms measurement gap

length, a measurement gap pattern that has a 6 ms measurement gap length is

used instead. The measurement gap repetition period of the measurement is

not affected by this change.

# 4 Network Impact of EPS Fallback for IMS Voice

| McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation   | Introduced | When the                 McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is set to                 FORCED, EPS fallback is triggered if an available LTE frequency             band is found for the EPS fallback.  VoNR is triggered under the following conditions:  The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is                         set to INACTIVE.     The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is                         set to ACTIVE and the UE is capable of VoNR.     The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is                         set to FORCED and no available LTE frequency band is found                         for the EPS fallback.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q1: EPS Fallback from NR Standalone to LTE with Measurement-Based Handover

This feature enhancement introduces support for EPS fallback handling for

non-emergency IMS voice services through measurement-based handover and measurement-based

release with redirection from NR standalone to LTE.

| Feature Name:           | EPS Fallback for IMS Voice   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5059                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | NR                           |

This enhancement uses the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure. If a new QoS flow is

requested with 5QI=1 for non-emergency voice services, the gNodeB replies to the AMF

with EPS fallback and starts the measurement procedure. According to the EPS fallback

operation type, either the handover procedure starts to the reported target eNodeB, or

the gNodeB performs release with redirection procedure to the reported E-UTRA

frequency.

Benefits

This feature enhancement provides two methods for EPS fallback for non-emergency IMS

voice services:

- Measurement-based release with redirection
- Measurement-based handover

These two methods are more accurate and provide a higher success rate than the

non-measurement-based EPS fallback because of the B1 measurements.

With these methods, it is possible to prioritize between the neighboring E-UTRA

frequencies to use for handover and release with redirection for EPS fallback.

If the operator configures more than one frequency to have the highest priority,

measurement-based handover and release with redirection can measure more than one

E-UTRA frequency.

Capacity and Performance

With this enhancement, the possibility that the UE is provided with the best voice

service available increases.

Operation

The following attributes are introduced for this enhancement:

- EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset
- ExternalEUtranCell.eUtranFrequencyRef
- ExternalEUtranCell.physicalLayerCellId
- ExternalEUtranCell.tac
- Mcfb.mcfbCellProfileEnabled
- McfbCellProfile.epsFallbackOperation
- McfbCellProfile.epsFbTargetSearchTimer
- McfbCellProfile.ReportConfigB1Rsrp
- McfbCellProfile.ReportConfigB1Rsrq
- McfbCellProfile.rsrpCellCandidate
- McfbCellProfile.rsrpCriticalCoverage
- McfbCellProfile.rsrqCellCandidate
- McfbCellProfile.rsrqCriticalCoverage
- McfbCellProfile.triggerQuantity
- NRCellCU.mcfbCellProfileRef
- UeMCCellProfile.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrp
- UeMCCellProfile.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrq

If the McfbCellProfile.epsFallbackOperation

attribute is set to FORCED, release with redirection is used

without measurement for the EPS fallback. In this case, EPS fallback is triggered

for non-emergency voice calls only if an available LTE frequency band is found for

the EPS fallback. Otherwise, VoNR is triggered for non-emergency voice calls.

The following PM counters are introduced for this enhancement:

- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmEbsHoPrepAttOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmEbsHoPrepSuccOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmEbsHoExeAttOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmEbsHoExeSuccOutEutran

Interfaces

show EPS fallback as a result.

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellCU.pmHoPrepFailOutEpsfb PM counter to monitor Xn

handover preparations cancelled by EPS fallback.

The feature enhancement introduces the

McfbCellProfile.epsFallbackPrioritization attribute. The

attribute can be used to set if EPS fallback is prioritized or not.

Interfaces

The NGAP and XnAP interfaces are updated with cause descriptions for EPS fallback

priority over Xn handover preparation case.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support

the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
