# 1 Shared Networks Identity

| Value Package Identity   | FAJ 801 4010   |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Introduced in            | N20.Q1         |

# 2 Benefits of Shared Networks

Network sharing gives the possibility of sharing RAN equipment to better utilize the

equipment. It enables faster rollout, more cost-effective coverage, and more efficient

operation.

Spectrum sharing is also possible with shared RAN, which enables multiple operators to

use the same spectrum. This can increase network efficiency and utilize a higher peak

rate if multiple operators contribute spectrum.

# 3 Included Functions

## 3.1 NR Multi-Operator RAN Overview

The NR Multi-Operator RAN feature allows operators to share the same radio unit with a

dedicated spectrum per operator.

| Feature Name           | NR Multi-Operator RAN                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5126                                            |
| Value Package Name     | Shared Networks                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4010                                            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type            | NR                                                      |
| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature. No license is required. |

Summary

In NR Multi-Operator RAN, each spectrum is managed by a gNodeB, one per operator.

Depending on the shared radio unit, different configurations are covered. NR Multi-Operator

RAN supports EN-DC and NR SA.

## 3.2 Shared NR RAN Overview

The Shared NR RAN feature enables the sharing of NR RAN between hosting and

participating operators. The feature uses the MOCN and MORAN sharing cases to provide

substantial CAPEX and OPEX savings, along with reduced environmental footprint.

| Feature Name           | Shared NR RAN                                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5211                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Shared Networks                                                            |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4010                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Shared NR RAN feature supports the following sharing cases:

| MOCN          |    | The baseband units, the radio units, and the spectrum cell carriers 								are shared between the operators.            |
|---------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                                          |
| MORAN         |    | The baseband units and radio units are shared, while the spectrum 								cell carriers are dedicated for each operator. |
|               |    |                                                                                                                          |
| MOCN as MORAN |    | A special configuration of MORAN, where the dedicated spectrum cell 								carriers have the same first PLMN ID.        |

MOCN is the only 3GPP-specified network sharing solution. For more information see,

3GPP TS 23.501.

Shared NR RAN supports NR Standalone and EN-DC.

For possible sharing cases with eNodeBs, see Shared LTE RAN in the LTE

RAN library.

Figure 1   NR Standalone Sharing Cases

Figure 1 shows the possible sharing cases for NR

Standalone deployments.

The Shared NR RAN feature has the following benefits:

- MOCN, MORAN, and MOCN as MORAN configurations are enabled for both NR Standalone and EN-DC. Note: NR Standalone High-Band deployments only support MOCN configurations.
- In all sharing cases, hosting and participating operators can use a more flexible transport configuration with transport network separation for each operator.
- Spectrum sharing is possible, which allows multiple operators to use the same spectrum. This can increase network efficiency and utilize a higher peak rate if multiple operators contribute spectrum. This is applicable for all sharing cases.
- In an MOCN configuration, hosting and participating operators can define their own Tracking Area (TA) planning. This is done by allowing planning. Cells can have their own TACs dedicated to the operator, while a common NCI is shared.
