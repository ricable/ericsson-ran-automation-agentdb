# 1 Energy-Optimized Power Allocation Overview

The feature dynamically scales down the output power for downlink transmissions to

reduce power consumption in Low-Band and Mid-Band.

| Feature Name           | Energy-Optimized Power Allocation                                          |

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5805                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | 5G Advanced Energy Performance                                             |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature scales down power and expands resource allocation, which lead to a

decrease in PDSCH TX power. The power backoff calculation is based on the following

factors:

- Downlink slot load
- SINR for each UE
- Configured value of the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.rbExpansionTarget attribute

The feature reduces radio power consumption, which might also lead to a decrease in

interference.

The feature is supported in Low-Band and Mid-Band deployments.

# 2 Dependencies of Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

The UE Grouping Framework feature must be enabled for this feature to

operate.

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

The feature calculates resource block utilization to apply the necessary amount of

power backoff.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operation of the Energy-Optimized Power Allocation Feature

1. The Energy-Optimized Power Allocation feature is activated in the cell.
2. The gNodeB sets the default values for the MOM attributes.
3. The threshold for average resource block symbol utilization is calculated. The threshold can be configured through the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.avgRbSymThresh attribute. If the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.avgRbSymThresh attribute is set to a value lower than 100%, the average resource block symbol utilization is counted over multiple downlink slots.
4. The gNodeB checks the resource block symbol utilization against the threshold to decide if power backoff is needed. If the value of the resource block symbol utilization is above the threshold, the gNodeB applies no power backoff.
5. If the value is below the threshold, the gNodeB calculates the total resource block estimation and expansion target in the current downlink slot. The expansion target can be configured through the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.rbExpansionTarget attribute.
6. The gNodeB calculates the required amount of power backoff, based on the resource block and expansion target calculations.
7. The gNodeB performs link adaptation compensation.
8. The gNodeB applies the power backoff.

Enabling the Energy-Optimized Power Allocation Feature

The feature can be enabled through the following attributes:

- EnergyOptPwrAlloc.energyOptPwrAllocCellMode to enable digital power backoff on cell level
- EnergyOptPwrAllocUeCfg.energyOptPwrAllocMode to enable digital power backoff for specific UE groups

Targeted Resource Block Usage

The feature introduces the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.rbExpansionTarget

attribute to set the targeted resource block usage value. If the estimated resource

block usage in a slot without power backoff is lower than the target value, the

Energy-Optimized Power Allocation feature decreases output power and decreases MCS

to match the lowered power. This results in an increase of resource block usage.

If the estimated resource block usage is higher than the

EnergyOptPwrAlloc.rbExpansionTarget attribute value, no power

backoff is performed. The resulting resource block allocation depends on the

following factors:

- SINR for each UE
- Estimated resource block usage

In rare cases, expansion can be higher than the target value.

Threshold for Applying Power Backoff

Optionally, the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.avgRbSymThresh attribute can be

used to configure the threshold for applying the Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

feature.

The threshold is based on the average utilization of downlink resource block symbols.

When the average utilization is higher than the value of the

EnergyOptPwrAlloc.avgRbSymThresh attribute, the

Energy-Optimized Power Allocation feature applies no digital power backoff. When the

average utilization is lower than or equal to the value of the

EnergyOptPwrAlloc.avgRbSymThresh attribute minus 10%, the

Energy-Optimized Power Allocation feature applies digital power backoff.

Power Consumption and Cell Load

The effectiveness of the feature in reducing power consumption also depends on the

cell load. The feature offers the highest benefit around medium cell load, while

this benefit is reduced at higher cell load.

Figure 2 shows average power consumption

levels in relation to the cell load and to the targeted resource block usage

configured in the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.rbExpansionTarget

attribute.

Figure 2   Power Consumption at Different Cell Load Levels and Targeted Resource Block

Usage Values

# 4 Network Impact of Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

The feature reduces radio power consumption for downlink transmissions.

Capacity and Performance

The digital power backoff applied by the feature reduces the power consumption of

radio units. This might also lead to a decrease in interference.

Figure 3   Reduced Power Consumption and Interference by the Energy-Optimized Power

Allocation Feature

The MCS reduction caused by the feature might result in decreased spectral

efficiency.

The digital power backoff applied by the feature is expected to slightly increase the

average

downlink

BLER.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

The feature introduces attributes to configure digital power backoff

applied

by the feature on cell level or for specific UE groups, and attributes to

configure the resource block usage.

Equation 1   Tx Pwr util with EOPA/Tx Pwr util without EOPA

Counters

The feature introduces the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmEeAllResBlockUsed
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymEstimatedPdschTypeA
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymPowerBackoffDistr

The performance of the feature can be observed through the following PM counters:

- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergy
- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated
- EnergyMeter.pmMaxPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmMinPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmPowerConsumption
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschTypeA

The NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl PM counter might decrease because of the

reduced use of padding bits caused by the feature. This does not affect the

NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb PM counter.

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure. After that, it must be enabled with an MO attribute.

Prerequisites

- The UE Grouping Framework feature is enabled.
- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the value of the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012811 MO instance.
2. Set the value of the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.energyOptPwrAllocCellMode attribute to ENABLED.
3. Optional: Set the value of the EnergyOptPwrAllocUeCfg.energyOptPwrAllocMode attribute to ENABLED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Energy-Optimized Power Allocation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Optional: Set the value of the EnergyOptPwrAllocUeCfg.energyOptPwrAllocMode attribute to DISABLED.
2. Set the value of the EnergyOptPwrAlloc.energyOptPwrAllocCellMode attribute to DISABLED.
3. Set the value of the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012811 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
