Summary

This feature allows the LMF to request indoor and macro positioning measurements from the

gNodeB when the UE context is set up without a PDU Session. It can be

used with the following features to provide NRPPa-based E-CID measurements without

PDU Session:

- Advanced RDS Location Support for Dedicated RAN
- High-Resolution Timing Advance for Macro Positioning
- Location Support
- NR Advanced UE Location Support
- Uplink Angle of Arrival for Macro Positioning
- Periodic Measurements for Macro Positioning

This results in more successful UE positioning attempts as UE positioning can be started in

any RRC state.

This feature is applicable to Low-Band and Mid-Band cells in an NR standalone deployment.

# 3 Feature Operation of Positioning of UEs without PDU Session

This feature allows the configuration of NRPPa-based E-CID UE measurements without

PDU Session.

The configuration of UE measurements without PDU Session can be initiated by

setting the value of the

UeNoDrbPCellProfileUeCfg.posUeWoPduSessionEnabled attribute to

TRUE.

On-Demand E-CID Measurement without PDU Session

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The LMF requests the UE location by initiating UE positioning measurements. This triggers the RAN paging procedure for the UE in RRC\_IDLE state.
2. The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) initiates the Network Triggered Service Request procedure to set up the UE context.
3. The LMF sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message to the gNodeB with a request for on-demand measurement reporting.
4. The gNodeB receives the measurement request. The gNodeB accepts the measurement request if it is able to initiate the measurements. It starts the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure and the process proceeds to step 5. The gNodeB rejects the measurement request if it is not able to initiate the measurements, and it sends back the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message to the LMF.
5. UE gathers the requested E-CID measurements.
6. The gNodeB sends back the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message to the LMF with the requested E-CID measurements.
7. The LMF estimates the UE location.

Periodic E-CID Measurement without PDU Session

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The LMF requests the UE location by initiating UE positioning measurements. This triggers the RAN paging procedure for the UE in RRC\_IDLE state.
2. The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) initiates the Network Triggered Service Request procedure to set up the UE context.
3. The LMF sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST message to the gNodeB with a request for periodic measurement reporting.
4. The gNodeB receives the measurement request.
    - The gNodeB accepts the measurement request if it is able to initiate the measurements, and it sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message to the LMF.
    - The gNodeB rejects the measurement request if it is not able to initiate the measurements, and it sends back the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message to the LMF.
5. The gNodeB starts the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure.
6. Depending on the availability of measurement information, the UE periodically gathers the requested E-CID measurements.
7. Depending on the availability of measurement information, the following operations are possible: If the gNodeB is able to report any of the requested measurement information, it periodically sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT REPORT message to the LMF with the requested E-CID measurements, and the process proceeds to step 8. If the gNodeB is not able to report any of the requested measurement information, it sends the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION message to the LMF and the periodic measurement reporting is stopped.
8. The LMF estimates the UE location.
9. Periodic measurement reporting is stopped and UE measurements are deconfigured if the gNodeB receives the NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT TERMINATION COMMAND message from the LMF.

# 6 Performance of Positioning of UEs without PDU Session

This feature uses EBS counters and PM events to observe UE positioning

attempts.

Counters

With this feature, the number of successful UE positioning attempts is expected to

increase, which can be observed through the following EBS counters under the

NRCellCU MO class:

- pmEbsEcidMeasInitReqOnDemandNoDrb
- pmEbsEcidMeasInitReqPeriodicNoDrb
- pmEbsEcidMeasInitRespOnDemandNoDrb
- pmEbsEcidMeasInitRespPeriodicNoDrb

With this feature, the number of failed UE positioning attempts is expected to

decrease, which can be observed through the

pmEbsEcidMeasFailIndicationNoDrb EBS counter under the

NRCellCU MO class.

For more information on the EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

The increased number of successful UE positioning attempts can be observed through

the following PM events:

- CuCpEcidMeasurementInitiationRequest
- CuCpEcidMeasurementInitiationResponse

The decreased number of failed UE positioning attempts can be observed through the

CuCpEcidMeasurementFailureIndication PM event.
