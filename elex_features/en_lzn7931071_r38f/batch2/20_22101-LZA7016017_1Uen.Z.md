## 3.1 PSCell Change to Higher Priority Overview

The feature enables inter-frequency PSCell change based on frequency

priority.

| Feature Name           | PSCell Change to Higher Priority                                                                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5334                                                                                       |
| Value Package Name     | Intelligent Traffic Management and Mobility                                                        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4022                                                                                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                                                |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                                                 |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                 node. |

The feature configures the UE to perform periodical coverage detection measurements then

performs PSCell change if a higher priority frequency is available.

This feature is only active when the UE is in good radio conditions.

## 3.2 RRC Inactive State Overview

This feature enables the gNodeB to release the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state instead of

RRC\_IDLE state when inactivity is detected. This feature also supports RRC Resume procedure

from RRC\_INACTIVE state, when the UE needs to be in RRC\_CONNECTED state.

| Feature Name           | RRC Inactive State                                                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5328                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Intelligent Traffic Management and Mobility                                |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4022                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The RRC Inactive State provides the following benefits:

- Signaling and transition time is reduced, when the UE resumes from RRC\_INACTIVE state to RRC\_CONNECTED state.
- When the UE is released to RRC\_INACTIVE state, it stores the radio configuration and security parameters.
- The RRC\_INACTIVE state allows wireless UEs to enter a low-power mode when not transmitting or receiving data or signaling.
- Reduced latency and battery consumption of UEs.

## 3.5 NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination Overview

The feature introduces support for NR traffic steering based on cell load to maximize

downlink UE throughput.

| Feature Name           | NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination                                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5584                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Intelligent Traffic Management and Mobility                                |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4022                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature allows NR traffic steering to take cell load into consideration. It enables the

gNodeB to consider the load of the candidate cells

when

selecting PCell and SCells for a given UE. By considering the

cell load, the gNodeB distributes the UEs over the available carriers by avoiding

cells with high load.

## 3.6 NR Data-Aware Mobility Overview

This feature enables mobility actions from NR standalone to LTE for UEs that experience

low performance.

| Feature Name           | NR Data-Aware Mobility                                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5696                                                       |
| Value Package Name     | Intelligent Traffic Management and Mobility                        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4022                                                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                 |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

This feature allows for mobility actions to be triggered for UEs that experience low

performance. UEs that experience low performance are moved from the NR standalone

network to the LTE network, which can increase UE performance and decrease load in

the NR cell.

UE mobility is triggered if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

- High downlink RLC buffer age or packet volume
- Low downlink and uplink restricted Medium Access Control (MAC) throughput

This feature works together with the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the

NR Traffic Steering feature. If the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover

function is enabled in the node, the aggregated bandwidth threshold provided by the

function is used for this feature.

Additional Information

For more information on the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function, see NR Traffic Steering.

Handover procedures through the N26 interface are described in 3GPP TS

23.502.

## 3.7 NR Small Cell Traffic Steering Overview

This feature introduces support for prioritized inter-gNodeB handover to small

cells.

| Feature Name           | NR Small Cell Traffic Steering                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5778                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Intelligent Traffic Management and Mobility                                |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4022                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature allows the NR Traffic Steering feature to consider and prioritize handover to

cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs that are valid mobility targets, but are

not identified as valid candidates for the Multi-Layer Coordination function. These

cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs are prioritized by the Multi-Layer

Coordination function when taking decisions about PCell change. This feature

initiates handover even when there are no ongoing PCell change decisions if the

Multi-Layer Coordination function finds a cell that belongs to an other vendor

gNodeB.

Cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs are non-Ericsson external cells on a referenced NR

frequency for a given PCell for UEs matching the UE group profile of the referenced

NR frequency relation.

This feature deals with cells that belong to other vendor gNodeBs only.
