method the RBS locks its system clock time to the time information from a GNSS receiver

connected to the RBS.

# 3 Feature Operation of Clock Source over GPS

The Clock Source over GPS feature is a method to lock the RBS clock to an external GNSS

reference.

The GNSS distributes accurate time information and can be used as a clock source for the

RBS Uu interface. An RBS that uses GNSS as a clock source for the Uu interface must be

equipped with a GNSS receiver that is connected to an antenna with direct visibility

from GNSS satellites as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   RBS Connectivity to GPS

GNSS Receiver System User Guide provides a

detailed description of installation options for the GNSS receiver, antenna, and other

components.

The GNSS receiver can provide the following types of information for Uu interface

synchronization:

- A 1-Pulse-per-Second (1PPS) signal for frequency synchronization of the system clock and carrier frequency synchronization of the Uu interface
- Absolute time for time and phase synchronization of the Uu interface

# 4 Network Impact of Clock Source over GPS

The Clock Source over GPS feature provides continuous time synchronization over the Uu interface.

Capacity and Performance

The time synchronization accuracy of the GNSS receiver is affected by signal

reflections from buildings surrounding the GNSS antenna. Because of the continuous

movement of the satellites, the length of these reflections changes over time, which

can make the node unable to use GNSS as its time synchronization reference.

To avoid unreliable GNSS time synchronization, the GNSS antenna must be mounted to a

location with an unobstructed view to the sky without any reflections from

surrounding buildings. The Clock Source over GPS feature is not affected by the GNSS

receiver week number rollover.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Clock Source over GPS

The feature can be configured with attributes associated to synchronization.

Parameters

For related parameters,

TimeSyncIO,

and the

GnssInfo

MO

class                 description.

# 6 Performance of Clock Source over GPS

The feature is associated with

several

counters

to measure the number of phase jumps.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The

following counters are associated with this feature

under

the TimeSyncIO

MO

class:

- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetActiveReference
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetAvg
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetMax
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetMin
- TimeSyncIO.gnssTimeOffsetStDev
- TimeSyncIO.phaseJump

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

this feature.
