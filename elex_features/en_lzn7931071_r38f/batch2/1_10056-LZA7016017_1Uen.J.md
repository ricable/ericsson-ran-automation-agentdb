# 1 PCI Planning in NR Networks Overview

PCI planning is an important aspect of network design. Proper planning helps to

minimize or avoid inter-cell interference.

Summary

In a network, a PCI is assigned to each cell with the

NRCellDU.nRPCI attribute. The PSS and SSS values are derived

from the PCI values of the cell. The PCI is also related to the DMRS of the PBCH and

to other reference signals used by Massive MIMO features for example.

To minimize or avoid inter-cell interference, a planned approach is recommended for

the allocation of available PCIs. Proper PCI planning makes it possible to reserve

PCIs for special purposes and to adapt the network to specific functions, for

example CSI-RS resource shifting.

The main considerations when planning the allocation of PCIs are as follows:

- Cell location, for example topology, transmitter heights, inter-site distance
- Network size, for example PCIs might need to be reused in large networks
- Radio properties, for example carrier frequencies

For more information, see Recommendations for Planning, and 3GPP TS

38.211, which gives detailed recommendations for PCI planning. This

Solution Guideline elaborates on the recommendations of the Technical

Specification.

# 2 Technical Background

## 2.1 Physical Cell Identity

The PCI is composed of the Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) and the Secondary

Synchronization Signal (SSS). The PCI is used for cell search procedures and cell

identification.

The PSS transmits one of three orthogonal sequences and the SSS transmits one of 336

binary sequences, so there are 1,008 unique PCIs.

The PCI value in NR is controlled by one parameter.

Table 1   Description of the NRCellDU.nRPCI parameter

| MO Class   | Name   | Description                                 | Value    |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| NRCellDU   | nRPCI  | Physical Cell Identity (PCI) of the NR cell | (0–1007) |

## 2.2 Channel State Information Reference Signal

The Channel State Information (CSI) RS is used by the UE to measure the radio channel

quality and report the result to the base station. In addition to the CSI-RSs, CSI

Interference Measurement (IM) resources are defined. These are configured for the UE to

measure downlink inter-cell interference. For eight ports in Mid-Band, the physical

resources are mapped as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Example of Mapping of CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs to Physical Resources for Eight Ports

in Mid-Band

In Low-Band and Mid-Band, the CSI-IM resources are shifted between adjacent cells based

on PCI Modulo 6 to avoid collisions between the CSI-IM resources in neighboring cells.

To mitigate the CSI-RS

interference between adjacent cells, CSI-RS resource shifting can be activated. When

CSI-RS resource shifting is active, the CSI-RS resource position for a specific cell is

selected based on PCI Modulo

6,

as shown in Figure 3. When CSI-RS resource

shifting is not active, the positions for CSI-RS resources are always fixed.

Figure 3   Shifting of CSI-RS and CSI-IM Resource Positions Because of PCI in NR

For

more information on the availability of CSI-RS resource shifting, see Massive MIMO Low-Band and Massive MIMO Mid-Band.

## 2.3 Tracking Reference Signal

The Tracking Reference Signal (TRS) for the PDSCH is used for channel estimation and

demodulation.

Two symbols per slot and every fourth subcarrier are used for the TRS. It is possible to

multiplex the PDSCH resource elements in the TRS symbols.

To mitigate the interference between adjacent cells, the TRS resource shifting function

can be activated. Apart from shifting TRS resource positions in adjacent cells,

multiplexing of the PDSCH resource elements is prevented, which means that the resource

elements are blanked and no data is transmitted in the TRS symbols.

The TRS resource position for a specific cell is selected based on PCI Modulo 6 as shown

in Figure 4.

Figure 4   Shifting of TRS Resource Positions Because of PCI in NR

For more information about the availability of TRS resource shifting, see Massive MIMO Mid-Band.

## 2.4 Demodulation Reference Signal for the PBCH

The Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) carries part of the system information required by

the UE to access the network. Together with the PSS and SSS it forms an SSB block that

is part of the initial access procedure. The PBCH contains its own Demodulation

Reference Signal (DMRS) as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5   DMRS Shifts for the PBCH in NR

The DMRS shifts are generated by a scrambling sequence as described in 3GPP TS

38.211. There are four different shifts for the PBCH and the placement of the

DMRS is given by PCI Modulo 4.

# 3 Recommendations for Planning

## 3.1 Unique PCIs within the Same Frequency Carrier

The same PCIs are required to be avoided within the same site. They are also required to

be avoided as neighbors and as neighbors of neighbors.

There are 1,008 unique PCIs available for NR, as described in Physical Cell Identity. Of these, some groups of PCIs can be reserved for

special purposes, for example in-building and PLMN borders or for future expansions.

Because of this, it is realistic to assume that around 900 PCIs are available for

planning an NR network and if there are more than 900 cells in the network, some PCIs

have to be reused.

The reuse distance depends mainly on the propagation properties in the network area. The

propagation properties depend on the following factors:

- Carrier frequency
- Transmitter heights
- Topography
- Clutter types

Figure 6 shows a schematic example where PCIs are

reused every fourth inter-site distance.

Figure 6   Example of PCI Reuse at Every Fourth Inter-Site Distance

## 3.2 Unique PCIs within Different Frequency Carriers

For High-Band, the same PCIs are required to be avoided within the same site for

different carriers sharing the same radio. Using the same PCI values for carriers

sharing the same Power Amplifier (PA) can cause throughput loss in the downlink. When

the same PCI is used in combination with the radio PA limitation, the transmitter Error

Vector Magnitude (EVM) degrades, and causes intermodulation distortions and throughput

loss in the downlink.

Unique PCIs must be configured for different carriers sharing the same PA to avoid

performance degradation in High-Band.

The recommendation of unique PCIs does not apply to cells for different frequency

carriers at different radios and for Low-Band and Mid-Band. In this case, it is

recommended to set the same PCI values to simplify the PCI planning process of several

carriers.

## 3.3 Different Primary Sequences

It is recommended to deploy different PSS values within the same site, which is possible

for a site containing at most three sectors. This helps the detection of SSS. In case of

TDD networks, it is also recommended to deploy different PSS values in neighboring cells

to help the detection of SSS at the cell border.

To configure different PSS values within the same site, different step plans can be used

to simplify the planning. Table 2 shows an

example of a step 1 plan where one PCI group is planned per site in case of a

three-sector site. For example, in PCI group 0, PCI values 0, 1 and 2 are configured in

the site.

Table 2   Step 1 Plan with Different PSS Values within the Same Site

|   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |   10 |   11 | ...   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-------|
|   0 |   3 |   6 |   9 |  12 |  15 |  18 |  21 |  24 |  27 |   30 |   33 | …     |
|   1 |   4 |   7 |  10 |  13 |  16 |  19 |  22 |  25 |  28 |   31 |   34 | …     |
|   2 |   5 |   8 |  11 |  14 |  17 |  20 |  23 |  26 |  29 |   32 |   35 | …     |

Table 3 shows an example of a step 8 plan with

different PSS values deployed within the same site in case of a three-sector site.

Table 3   Step 8 Plan with Different PSS Values within the Same Site

|   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |   10 |   11 | ...   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-------|
|   0 |   3 |   6 |   9 |  12 |  15 |  18 |  21 |  24 |  27 |   30 |   33 | …     |
|   8 |  11 |  14 |  17 |  20 |  23 |  26 |  29 |  32 |  35 |   38 |   41 | …     |
|  16 |  19 |  22 |  25 |  28 |  31 |  34 |  37 |  40 |  43 |   46 |   49 | …     |

Figure 7 shows an example of a PCI/PSS

deployment.

Figure 7   Example of a PCI/PSS Deployment

Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 in Site A and Site B are required to use different PSS values.

Cell 1 in Site A and Cell 3 in Site B are also required to use different PSS values.

If there are more than three sectors in a site, it is not possible to configure unique

PSS values in the site. In adjacent cells, different PSS values are required to be set,

as shown in an example with five sectors in Figure 8.

Figure 8   Example of a PCI/PSS Deployment in a Site with Five Sectors

Planning different PSS values in neighboring cells is difficult, because there might be

several neighbor relations. A solution is to introduce ranking for neighbor relations.

Cells within the same site can be ranked higher and lower ranking levels can be

determined by distance, cell overlap or handover statistics.

## 3.4 CSI-RS, TRS and CSI-IM Resource Shifting

The CSI-RS

resource

shifting

function, the TRS

resource

shifting

function and the always-on shifting of the CSI-IM resources are described in

Massive MIMO Low-Band and

Massive MIMO Mid-Band. To minimize the interference between

colliding CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs in neighboring cells, different PCI Modulo 6 values are

required to be planned in adjacent cells. This is also required for the TRS Resource

Shifting function to work properly. A way to achieve this is to deploy a step plan as

described in Different Primary Sequences. Planning different PSS values within a

site results in different PCI Modulo 6 values in adjacent cells in case of three sectors

in a site.

## 3.5 Different PBCH DMRS Shifts

PBCH DMRS shifts are defined in Demodulation Reference Signal for the PBCH and in 3GPP TS

38.211. Using the same or different PBCH DMRS shifts in adjacent cells has in

general no impact on the system performance.

In High-Band, when using the same PCI values for carriers sharing the same PA,

performance degradation occurs arising from interfering PBCH DMRS locations. This is

avoided by configuration of unique PCIs as described in Unique PCIs within Different Frequency Carriers.

## 3.6 Summary

To summarize, there are the following recommendations and considerations for planning of

PCIs:

- For the same frequency carrier, unique PCIs are required to be configured within the same site and as neighbors and neighbors of neighbors.
- For High-Band and for different carriers sharing the same PA, unique PCIs should be configured within the same site to avoid performance degradation.
- Within a site, different primary sequences are required to be deployed in adjacent cells to help the detection of secondary sequences.
- In neighboring cells, in a fully time synchronized network, different primary sequences are required to be deployed to help the detection of secondary sequences at cell borders.
- To minimize the interference between colliding CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs in neighboring cells, PCI Modulo 6 values are required to be set differently in adjacent cells.
- To make the TRS Resource Shifting function work as expected, PCI Modulo 6 values are required to be set differently in adjacent cells.
