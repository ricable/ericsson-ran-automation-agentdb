Summary

The GTP-U Supervision feature enables the supervision of the gNodeB-terminated S1-U, X2-U,

Xn-U, and NG-U GTP-U paths. The GTP-U path management includes the following

response types for all user plane interfaces:

- Responding with a GTP-U Echo Response to a GTP-U Echo Request.
- Responding with a GTP-U Error Indication.

The GTP-U Supervision feature enables the supervision of the gNodeB-terminated

message to incoming G-PDU messages including unknown TEID.

The GTP-U Supervision feature enables the sending of regular GTP-U Echo Requests on

the S1-U, X2-U, Xn-U, and NG-U interfaces through the gNodeB. By detecting

unreachable GTP-U peer nodes, the gNodeB ensures that the UE is set up on a

qualified GTP-U path. The gNodeB also handles incoming GTP-U Error

Indication messages.

The feature enables the gNodeB to perform scalable GTP-U supervision for GTP-U peer nodes

through the S1-U, X2-U, Xn-U, and NG-U interfaces, by specifying their local IP

addresses for each PLMN.

Hardware

The feature can be used for all products supporting the NR CUUP role.

Limitations

Bearer handling at the reception of a GTP-U Error Indication message

on the X2-U and the Xn-U interfaces is not supported.

At the reception of a GTP-U Error Indication message on the S1-U and

the NG-U interfaces, all resources in a UE are released. The resources

must

be released on a DRB or a PDU session

level.

In case of a GTP-U path failure on the NG-U or the Xn-U interfaces, all resources in

a UE are released. The resources are released on a DRB or a PDU session level.

If Xn and X2 shares the same GTP-U path, GTP-U supervision on this path might not

work correctly. For example, the GTP-U supervision for this path might be disabled

on some circumstances, even if it is enabled by configuration.

If NG and S1 shares the same GTP-U path, GTP-U supervision on this

path does not work correctly.

Xn GTP-U path is only monitored when the first session on this path is created for Xn

user data forwarding traffic or for NR-DC traffic on the Secondary Node. If the

first session is created for NR-DC traffic on the Master Node, GTP-U supervision on

this path is disabled.

Data forwarding paths are not excluded from monitoring.

PM Counters for GTP-U echo on Xn-U and X2-U interfaces are not supported.

GTP-U supervision with overlapping IP addresses is not supported.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of GTP-U Supervision

The feature supervises the gNodeB-terminated GTP-U paths, and enables the supervision of

the reachability for the S1-U, X2-U, Xn-U, and NG-U paths.

The feature introduces the following functions:

- Generation of outgoing GTP-U Error Indication
- Handling of incoming GTP-U Error Indication
- GTP-U Echo Responder
- GTP-U Echo Originator and bearer handling

## 3.1 Generation of Outgoing GTP-U Error Indication

Outgoing GTP-U Error Indications are handled for all user plane interfaces between

the peer nodes and the gNodeB.

When the peer node sends G-PDUs with unknown TEID to the gNodeB, the gNodeB determines

that due to the unknown TEID, the received G-PDU does not belong to any existing GTP-U

tunnel. As a result, a GTP-U Error Indication message is sent to the peer

node. The DSCP for transmitted GTP-U Error Indication can be configured using the

GtpuSupervision.gtpuErrorIndDscp MO attribute.

Figure 1   Generation of Outgoing GTP-U Error Indication in NR

## 3.2 Handling of Incoming GTP-U Error Indication

Incoming GTP-U Error Indication procedures are handled for the S1-U and NG-U

interfaces.

When the gNodeB receives a GTP-U Error Indication message from the SGW

through the S1-U interface, the gNodeB releases the Secondary Node-terminated DRBs for

the UE. When GTP-U Error Indication message is received from the UPF

through the NG-U interface, the gNodeB releases the PDU sessions for the UE, and sends a

PDU SESSION RESOURCE NOTIFY message to the AMF through the NG-C

interface.

Figure 2   Reception of GTP-U Error Indication

over

S1-U and NG-U in NR

## 3.3 GTP-U Echo Responder

The gNodeB responds with a GTP-U Echo Response to a GTP-U Echo Request for all user

plane interfaces.

If the GTP-U Echo Request contains an EPE, all needed timestamps are collected and

returned in the EPE of the GTP-U Echo Response. The DSCP for the transmitted GTP-U Echo

Response is the same as the DSCP of the received GTP-U Echo Request.

Figure 3   GTP-U Echo Responder in NR

## 3.4 GTP-U Echo Originator and Bearer Handling

GTP-U Echo Requests and GTP-U Echo Responses can be sent and received between the

gNodeB and peer nodes for the S1-U, X2-U, Xn-U, and NG-U interfaces. By detecting

unreachable GTP-U peer nodes, the gNodeB ensures that the UE is set up on a qualified GTP-U

path using bearer handling.

GTP-U Echo Originator

The GTP-U Echo Originator can be configured by setting the attributes of the

GtpuSupervisionProfile MO instances. The gNodeB provides

scalable GTP-U supervision, based on what interface is configured by the user in the

supervision configuration profile.

The monitoring starts by sending a GTP-U Echo Request on the GTP-U path when the

first GTP-U tunnel is established and the GTP-U path is created. The monitoring ends

when the GTP-U path is removed 30 minutes after the last GTP-U tunnel is

released.

The GTP-U Echo Request is sent every 60 seconds. For faster link failure detection,

if the GTP-U peer node does not respond to the GTP-U Echo Request, the GTP-U Echo

Request is sent every 3 seconds. When the GTP-U peer node is declared as

unreachable, the GTP-U Echo Request period is reverted to 60 seconds.

The reachability towards GTP-U peer nodes is reflected based on the following

conditions:

- Detection time for unreachability is from 15 to 75 seconds, meaning no GTP-U Echo Responses are received for five consecutive 3-second periods.
- Recovery time for reachability is around 180 seconds, meaning no GTP-U Echo Responses are received for three consecutive 60-second periods.

The DSCP for GTP-U Echo Requests can be configured using the

GtpuSupervisionProfile.gtpuEchoDscp MO attribute.

The round-trip delay (RTD) measurements for GTP-U Echo messages are supported on the

S1-U and NG-U interfaces of a gNodeB.

Figure 4   GTP-U Echo Originator

For NR-NR Dual Connectivity split DRBs, Echo Originator over Xn-U is only enabled on

the Secondary Node.

Figure 5   GTP-U Echo Originator over the Xn-U interface

Bearer Handling

If the gNodeB detects the unreachable GTP-U peer nodes, it starts the bearer handling

process to ensure that the UE can be set up on a qualified GTP-U path.

When a GTP-U path failure is detected on the NG-U interface, all UEs using the NG-U

GTP-U path are released. All new PDU Sessions on the unreachable NG-U GTP-U path are

rejected.

If a UE is configured with NR-DC or EN-DC, and GTP-U path failure is detected on the

NG-U interface or the S1-U interface on the Secondary Node, then all Secondary Node

resources for UEs using the unreachable path are released. New PDU Session (or S1

bearer) attempts on the unreachable NG-U or S1-U path fail and result in a Secondary

Node release procedure.

If a UE is configured with NR-DC, and GTP-U path failure is detected on the NG-U

interface on the Master Node, all Master Node and Secondary Node resources for the

UE are released. All new PDU Sessions on unreachable NG-U path on the Master Node

are rejected.

If a UE is configured with NR-DC or EN-DC, and GTP-U path failure is detected on the

Xn-U interface or the X2-U interface on the Secondary Node, all Secondary Node

resources for UEs using the unreachable path are released. New PDU Session (or new

S1 bearer) attempts on the unreachable Xn-U or X2-U path fail and result in a

Secondary Node release procedure.

GTP-U path failure detected on the Xn-U interface on the Master Node has no impact on

UEs using the unreachable path.

GTP-U path failure detection does not affect existing user data forwarding sessions.

User data forwarding sessions can be created on unreachable GTP-U paths.

## 3.5 Configuration Rules and Examples for GTP-U Supervision

Configuration rules help minimize the chance of misconfiguration and excessively

complex configuration.

### 3.5.1 Configuration Rules

To configure each GtpuSupervisionProfile MO instance, the following

conditions must be fulfilled if

GtpuSupervisionProfile.gtpuEchoEnabled is set to

TRUE:

- The GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList or GtpuSupervisionProfile.endpointResourceRef MO attributes must not be empty at the same time.
- The GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList MO attribute must either be empty, or must only contain one of the following interface values: S1 X2 XN NG

To change the values of GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList and

GtpuSupervisionProfile.endpointResourceRef, the value of

GtpuSupervisionProfile.gtpuEchoEnabled must be set to

FALSE.

The interface name value in the GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList

MO attribute must be unique for all GtpuSupervisionProfile MO

instances if the GtpuSupervisionProfile.endpointResourceRef MO

instance is empty.

Each EndpointResource MO instance that is referenced by an

endpointResourceRef attribute, must be reserved by at least one

ResourcePartitionMember or GNBCUUPFunction MO

instance.

At least one LocalIpEndpoint.interfaceList MO attribute must contain

at least one interface name value that matches an interface name value of the

GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList MO attribute.

The reference to the EndpointResource MO must be unique among all

GtpuSupervisionProfile MO instances that contain the matching

interface name value. The reference is contained in the

GtpuSupervisionProfile.endpointResourceRef MO attribute.

Figure 8   Example for a Unique EndpointResource Reference Among

GtpuSupervisionProfile MO Instances

### 3.5.2 Example of S1 and X2 for Two PLMNs in NR NSA Deployment

This example showcases a configuration with the S1 and X2 interfaces for two PLMNs that

have their own local IP addresses for the S1, and X2 interfaces respectively. Each GTP-U

Supervision profile can be applied by specifying one interface, or by referencing more

than one endpoint resource.

Figure 9   Configuration Example for the S1 and X2 Interfaces for Two PLMNs

### 3.5.3 Example of NG and Xn for Two PLMNs and Network Slicing in NR SA Deployment

This example showcases a configuration with the NG and Xn interfaces for two PLMNs with

network slicing, that have their own local IP addresses for the NG and Xn interfaces

respectively. Each GTP-U Supervision profile can be applied by specifying one interface,

or by referencing more than one EndpointResource MO instances.

Figure 10   Configuration Example for the NG and Xn Interfaces for Two PLMNs

### 3.5.4 Example of Dual-mode for Co-located NR NSA and NR SA Cell Sites

This example showcases a configuration with the S1, X2, NG and Xn interfaces for NR NSA

and NR SA dual-mode. The EndpointResource MO instances can be

referenced simultaneously from the ResourcePartitionMember and

GtpuSupervisionProfile MO instances that belong to both NR NSA

and NR SA configurations.

Figure 11   Configuration Example of Dual-mode for NR NSA and NR SA

# 4 Network Impact of GTP-U Supervision

The feature uses the S1-U, X2-U, Xn-U, and NG-U interfaces.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

The GTP-U Supervision feature introduces the transmission of GTP-U echo requests on

all user plane interfaces, and the response to incoming GTP-U echo request for the

S1-U, X2-U, Xn-U, and NG-U interfaces in the gNodeB.

The gNodeB sends a GTP-U error indication message when it receives a G-PDU with an

unknown TEID for all user plane interfaces, and handles the incoming GTP-U error

indication on the S1-U and NG-U interfaces.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 22.1 or higher is required to configure the

GtpuSupervision and GtpuSupervisionProfile

MO instances.

ENM version 22.4 or higher is required to show PM counters on

S1ULink and EP\_NgU MO instances.

ENM version 23.3 or higher is required for the

CuUpGtpuEchoPathStatus PM event.

interfaces.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines

## 8.1 Enable GTP-U Supervision

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement adds support for GTP-U supervision on Xn-U interfaces.

GTP-U path failure and recovery can be detected on Xn NR-DC paths and X2 EN-DC

paths.

PDU sessions are released or rejected when a GTP-U path becomes unreachable for the

following user plane interfaces:

- S1-U
- X2-U
- NG-U
- Xn-U

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The GtpuSupervisionProfile MO is extended to support GTP-U

supervision configuration for Xn-U interfaces.

The GTP-U Supervision feature can be configured as follows:

- The supervised interfaces can be listed in the GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList attribute.
- If the GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList attribute is left empty, then all interfaces are to be supervised.

If the GtpuSupervisionProfile.interfaceList attribute is empty,

the GTP-U Supervision feature for Xn-U is automatically enabled after upgrade. If

the attribute value is not empty, it is required to add the XN

value to the list to supervise the Xn-U interface.

The feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes to observe monitoring

status and GTP-U path status on X2-U and Xn-U interfaces:

- RpUserPlaneLink.echoPeerStatus
- RpUserPlaneLink.monitoringStatus

The enhancement introduces the CuUpGtpuEchoPathStatus PM event to

receive notifications about GTP-U path failure and recovery for X2-U and Xn-U

interfaces.

Interfaces

When

GTP-U path failure is detected on any monitored interfaces, all UE contexts using

the affected paths are released on the node.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
