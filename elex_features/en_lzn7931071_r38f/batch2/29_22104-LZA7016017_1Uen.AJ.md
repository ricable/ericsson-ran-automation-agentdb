channels.

Summary

The feature is used for cell shaping. It is mandatory for the Massive MIMO Mid-Band feature,

which provides predefined cell shaping options.

For downlink, it is also possible to choose self-defined cell shaping by configuring

arbitrary beamforming weights.

# 2 Dependencies of Control Channel Beamforming

The Control Channel Beamforming feature requires specific hardware equipment and has

a resource partitioning-related dependency.

Hardware

The feature only supports AAS radio units. For more information, see Radio Node Configuration.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

There are no specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Control Channel Beamforming

The Control Channel Beamforming feature is used for cell shaping. The cell shape is

configured through attributes.

Figure 1    Common Beamforming with Configurable Coverage Shapes

The coverage shape is configurable through the

CommonBeamforming.coverageShape attribute.

The CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt and the

CommonBeamforming.cbfMacroTaperType attributes can only be

adjusted for the MACRO\_1 and the MACRO\_WIDE\_1

configurations. For the valid ranges of the

CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt attribute, see the Antenna Integrated Radio Unit Description of the applicable

radio unit.

The CommonBeamforming MO contains attributes that show the values

selected and in use. Table 2 shows the

configurable attributes and their read-only pairs.

Table 2   Attributes Indicating Selected Values

| Configurations                           | Selected Value                               |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| CommonBeamforming.coverageShape          | CommonBeamforming.usedCoverageShape          |
| CommonBeamforming.digitalTilt            | CommonBeamforming.usedDigitalTilt            |
| CommonBeamforming.azimuthCoverageWidth   | CommonBeamforming.usedAzimuthCoverageWidth   |
| CommonBeamforming.elevationCoverageWidth | CommonBeamforming.usedElevationCoverageWidth |
| CommonBeamforming.digitalPan             | CommonBeamforming.usedDigitalPan             |

The horizontal and vertical HPBW is set using the

CommonBeamforming.coverageShape attribute.

Multiple antennas enable the beamforming. Beamforming weights are necessary to control

the direction of a wavefront. The magnitude and phase of the individual antenna signals

need appropriate beamforming weights.

Downlink common beamforming weights are applied to the following channels:

- PSS and SSS
- PBCH and associated DMRSs
- PDCCH and associated DMRSs
- PDSCH and associated DMRSs (in cases when UE-specific beamforming is not applicable)

Uplink common beamforming weights are applied to the following channels:

- PRACH
- PUCCH and associated DMRS

Customized control channel beamforming for downlink can be configured by the

CommonBeamforming.customComBfwWideBeam attribute, which enables

the configuration of up to 64 antenna branches.

The customized control beamforming configuration takes effect when the

CommonBeamforming.customComBfwWideBeam attribute is not empty.

The beamforming configuration is applied for downlink common control channels. The

content of the antennaNo field of the

CommonBeamforming.customComBfwWideBeam attribute must be the same

as the number of the antennas of the radio units being used.

# 4 Network Impact of Control Channel Beamforming

# 6 Performance of Control Channel Beamforming

The Control Channel Beamforming feature does not have associated KPIs, counters, or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
