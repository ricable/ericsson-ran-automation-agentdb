power from the PDSCH when it is scheduled with 256-QAM modulation.

| Feature Name           | Modulation-Aware Power Control                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5423                                            |
| Value Package Name     | Performance Boost                                       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4021                                            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type            | NR                                                      |
| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature. No license is required. |

Summary

The feature backs off power from the PDSCH to reduce EVM when power amplifiers run at

a power level that is close to or at maximum power. The power backoff avoids

clipping and reduces EVM, which results in higher throughput.

When the feature is activated, a power backoff value is determined by the radio unit.

That value is applied when 256-QAM modulation is scheduled for a UE.

Peak throughput results show gains when backoff is used at a power level that is

close to or at maximum power in ideal radio frequency conditions.

Radio reporting is valid on Massive MIMO radio units and some Remote radio units with external

antenna. For other cases, a generic backoff value is determined by the Baseband

Radio Node.

In ESS deployments, the scheduler considers the traffic load for LTE and NR cells.

The feature improves throughput for high SINR users when power and traffic are close

to or at maximum levels. The scheduler continues to guide power backoff if one of

the partner cells in the ESS configuration is locked or deactivated.

## 3.7 Uplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing Overview

Summary

Among the four antennas in a 4TX/4RX radio, two antennas are of one polarization and the other

two antennas are of the other polarization. The beams of these two polarizations are

generally not aligned. The feature estimates and compensates antenna phase

distortion and time delay for 4TX/4RX radios providing NR services, so that the two

beams of different polarizations are aligned. This mitigates NR performance

degradation caused by phase distortion and time delay in uncalibrated antennas.

An assistant UE is chosen periodically and reconfigured for PMI collection.

Summary

Certain weather conditions can cause atmospheric ducts, which might cause interference between

downlink and uplink slots in remote TDD cells. The feature can mitigate the effects

of interference on the remote cell and the UEs in the following ways:

- Downlink slot blanking on the aggressor cell
- Offloading the UEs with poor uplink quality to an NR FDD or LTE FDD carrier
- Blocking the incoming mobility of cell-edge UEs

As a result, the remote interference in the victim cell is reduced or the

impact of the remote interference in the victim cell is reduced.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature introduces the support of power-based closed-loop power control. The

gNodeB can instruct the UE to correct the transmission power, which can help with

full pathloss mitigation and obtaining an uplink SINR with which maximum throughput

can be secured.

The feature is configured on the UE group level, using the

PowerControlUeCfg.puschPowerControlModeFr1 attribute. The

value of the target transmission power is the total received PSD.

On the gNodeB side, the PowerControlUeCfg.pZeroNomPuschOffset

attribute can provide additional offset. This value does not affect the P0 value,

but provides an offset relative to the P0 affecting only the PUSCH received PSD

target of the gNodeB. Other gNodeB targets are also changed by the same amount for

the following targets:

- 64-QAM modulation
- 256-QAM modulation
- Uplink Single-User MIMO feature enabled with more than one layer

The feature supports NR Standalone and EN-DC deployments on Low-Band and Mid-Band

frequencies.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improves peak UE uplink throughput maintenance
- Provides MO configuration for closed-loop power control in the UE Grouping Framework
- Decreases UE energy consumption
- Can help mitigate the effects of remote interference

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

A combined cell is a logical cell that contains multiple sectors carriers. The border

of this cell is the combined border for all sector carriers in it.

The feature supports a mixed configuration of non-combined and combined cells on the same

node, with up to six sector carriers in a combined cell. The UE does not experience

any NR cell change at sector carrier switching within the combined cell.

Maximum one NR combined cell is supported for each RAN Compute unit.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Extended single cell coverage
- Simplified cell planning and management by reducing the number of cells
- Improved mobility by eliminating the need for inter-cell handovers within a combined cell

## 3.17 NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size Overview

The feature reduces latency by allowing larger uplink grants with more efficient use of

uplink resources as a response to a received scheduling request on PUCCH.

| Feature Name           | NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size                                      |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                 |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The NR Adaptive Uplink Grant Size feature has the following benefits:

- Reduced latency and time to the first byte by allowing larger uplink grants
- Observability for each UE group with the UE Grouping Framework feature
- Parameterized functions for each UE group with the UE Grouping Framework feature

Usually larger uplink grants can waste uplink resources, because the gNodeB cannot determine

how much uplink resources are needed until BSR is received. This feature facilitates

setting a larger grant size and therefore helps to waste less uplink resources when

responding to a scheduling request on PUCCH.

Group level observability facilitation and uplink

greediness

configuration can be controlled by the specific attribute based on the UE Grouping

Framework feature. Depending on the setting, the scheduler can be

more

or less greedy in terms of uplink PRB allocation, when responding

to a scheduling request on PUCCH. The feature uses the UE Grouping Framework feature

to facilitate group-level observability and group-level function configuration.

## 3.18 NR Aperiodic CSI Trigger Handling Overview

The feature increases the periodicity of aperiodic CSI based on the downlink

buffer.

| Feature Name           | NR Aperiodic CSI Trigger Handling                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5758                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | Performance Boost                                                          |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4021                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature extends aperiodic CSI reporting periodicity for certain users based on downlink

traffic. UEs with low downlink traffic demands are assigned a longer CSI reporting

period. This might improve uplink throughput because more uplink slots are

available.

## 3.19 NR Downlink Beam Optimizer Overview

The feature optimizes codebook-based beamforming on the PDCCH.

| Feature Name           | NR Downlink Beam Optimizer                                                 |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature introduces a backup codebook-based beamforming state to the existing

codebook-based beamforming fallback mechanism, and allows the configuration of the

fallback conditions for this enhanced backup mechanism. When the gNodeB receives a

successful CSI report while codebook-based beamforming is active, the report is

stored as a backup. The backup state relies on the backup CSI reports to prolong the

use of codebook-based beamforming on the PDCCH over common channel beamforming once

the fallback conditions are met.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Configurable conditions for the enhanced fallback mechanism
- Improved PDCCH CCE utilization and reduced PDCCH blocking
- Increased PDCCH robustness
