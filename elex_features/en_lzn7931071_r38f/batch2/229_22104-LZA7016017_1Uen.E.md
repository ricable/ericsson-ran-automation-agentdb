# 1 Priority Indication in RRC Release Overview

This feature enables the target LTE or NR cell to recognize if UEs redirected from the

serving cell use MPS or EPS fallback for IMS voice during the Release with Redirect

procedure.

Summary

This feature reduces the drop ratio for prioritized services by sustaining the

continuation of session prioritization during the following procedures:

- Release with Redirect to LTE for MPS and IMS voice sessions
- Release with Redirect to NR for MPS sessions

This feature has the following benefits:

- Improved network capabilities to recognize MPS or IMS voice users after the Release with Redirect procedure
- Improved user experience by reducing rejections of MPS or IMS voice users after the Release with Redirect procedure

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The priority indication in RRC release function is not available for the Release with

Redirect procedure during emergency fallback to LTE when the capability check in the

AMF fails during the Initial Context Setup procedure.

Network Requirements

This feature requires the following network elements:

- UE The UE must support the mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE if MPS is used during the Release with Redirect procedure. Otherwise, the IE is not sent in the RRCRelease message. The UE must support the voiceFallbackIndicationEPS-r16 IE if EPS fallback for IMS voice is used during the Release with Redirect procedure. Otherwise, the IE is not sent in the RRCRelease message.
- ENM It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of Priority Indication in RRC Release

## 3.1 Release with Redirect to LTE for MPS and IMS Voice Sessions Procedure

When the Release with Redirect procedure is triggered, it is possible that both the

mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE and the

voiceFallbackIndication-r16  IE are included in the

RRCRelease message if the UE supports them and the required

conditions apply.

Operational Process of Release with Redirect to LTE for MPS

1. The gNodeB checks if the UE supports the mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE.
2. The gNodeB checks the PriorityService.pLMNIdList attribute for a matching PLMN ID value.Note: An empty list matches all values if the PriorityService.pLMNIdList attribute exists.
3. The gNodeB checks the PriorityService.arp5qiPairList attribute for any matching ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority) and 5QI pairs from the list of attempted or established PDU sessions.Note: An empty list matches all values if the PriorityService.arp5qiPairList attribute exists.
4. If the PriorityService.mpsPriorityForRwr attribute is set to true, the mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE is included in the RRCRelease message.

Operational Process of Release with Redirect to LTE for IMS Voice

Sessions

1. The gNodeB checks if any attempted or established PDU sessions contain 5QI=1.
2. The gNodeB checks the possibility of an EPS fallback indicated in the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE received from the core network.
3. If the Redirection for Voice EPS Fallback IE is not sent from the core network, the gNodeB checks that the Mcfb.voiceEpsFbPossible attribute is set to true.
4. The gNodeB checks if the UE supports the voiceFallbackIndicationEPS-r16 IE.
5. If the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbVoiceIndication attribute is set to true, the voiceFallbackIndication-r16 IE is included in the RRCRelease message.

## 3.2 Release with Redirect to NR for MPS Sessions Procedure

Operational Process of Release with Redirect to NR for MPS Sessions

1. The gNodeB checks if the UE supports the mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE.
2. The gNodeB checks the PriorityService.pLMNIdList attribute for a matching PLMN ID value.Note: An empty list matches all values if the PriorityService.pLMNIdList attribute exists.
3. The gNodeB checks the PriorityService.arp5qiPairList attribute for any matching ARP and 5QI pairs from the list of attempted or established PDU sessions.Note: An empty list matches all values if the PriorityService.arp5qiPairList attribute exists.
4. If the PriorityService.mpsPriorityForRwr attribute is set to true, the mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE is included in the RRCRelease message.

# 4 Network Impact of Priority Indication in RRC Release

This feature affects the Uu interface.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

This feature affects the Uu interface in the following cases:

- If the required conditions are satisfied, the mpsPriorityIndication-r16 IE is included in the RRCRelease message when MPS is used during the Release with Redirect procedure.
- If the required conditions are satisfied, the voiceFallbackIndication-r16 IE is included in the RRCRelease message when the EPS Fallback for IMS Voice feature is used during the Release with Redirect procedure.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Priority Indication in RRC Release

This feature uses existing counters to measure its performance regarding the number

of attempted and successful RRC connections.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following PM counters show in increase in the number of attempted and successful

RRC connections for LTE:
