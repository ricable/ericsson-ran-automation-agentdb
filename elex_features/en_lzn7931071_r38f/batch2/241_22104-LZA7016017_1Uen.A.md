Summary

The Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning feature automatically adjusts the

resources allocated to a radio resource partition. The allocation of the resources

is based on the number of DRBs in each partition.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Optimal spectrum resource distribution for each scenario
- Improved user experience
- Improved network efficiency and flexibility
- Reduced necessary manual configuration
- Faster resource allocation adjustment

# 3 Feature Operation of Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

This feature counts the number of DRBs in a partition and allocates resources based

on that number.

A partition is managed by the Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning feature if

all of the following conditions apply:

- The Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning feature is activated.
- At least one of the RrpController.slopeInfoDl and the RrpController.slopeInfoUl attributes is configured.
- The RrpController.rrpControllerMode attribute is set to AUTO\_CONTROL\_2.
- The ResourceAllocationPolicy.resourceShareLimitRef or the ServicePolicy.resourceShareLimitRef attribute refers to a valid ResourceShareLimit MO class instance.

Operational Process

A partition must be configured with the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.rrpControllerRef or the

ServicePolicy.rrpControllerRef attribute that references an

RrpController MO class instance.

The RrpController.rrpControllerMode attribute and at least one of

the RrpController.slopeInfoDl and the

RrpController.slopeInfoUl attributes must be properly

configured under the referenced RrpController MO class instance

for the feature to be operational.

Partitions configured for automation under the same

ResourceAllocationPolicy MO class must use the same type of

automation. The AUTO\_CONTROL\_1 and the

AUTO\_CONTROL\_2 settings for the

RrpController.rrpControllerMode attribute cannot coexist

under the same ResourceAllocationPolicy MO class.

The value of the ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed

attribute defines whether the over-allocation of partition shares is allowed. The

default value of the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute is

set to true. The value of the

ResourceAllocationPolicy.overAllocationAllowed attribute also

affects both the Automated Radio Resource Partitioning feature and the NR Radio

Resource Partitioning feature even if the Load-Based Automated Radio Resource

Partitioning feature is not activated.

# 4 Network Impact of Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning

This feature affects network capacity and performance.

Capacity and Performance

The dynamically changing resource shares provide increased resource efficiency.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Load-Based Automated Radio Resource Partitioning
