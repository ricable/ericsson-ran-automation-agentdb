# 1 Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption Overview

The Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption feature introduces configurable limits for

PDU sessions and QoS flows. This feature also enables the preemption of QoS flows with lower

priority to admit QoS flows with higher priority after reaching the configured

limit.

Summary

The Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption feature enables the configuration of PDU session

and QoS flow limits. After reaching the configured limits, new PDU sessions and QoS

flows are rejected.

This feature also enables the preemption of QoS flows with lower priority to admit QoS flows

with higher priority when the configured limit is reached. Flow priority is based on

the ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority) of the QoS flow, which is defined by the

core network when the QoS flow is requested. The preemption function is not

supported in NR-DC deployment.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Maintaining the performance of established traffic
- Reducing the impact of high priority traffic on low priority traffic
- Improving the possibilities of prioritization between the services in case of resource shortage

# 3 Feature Operation of Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption

The Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption feature allows the admission of a new

QoS flow after the configured limit for QoS flows is reached.

The Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption feature can be configured with the

FlowLimit.preemptionEnabled attribute.

This feature enables the admission of a new QoS flow after reaching the configured limit

of QoS flows for a traffic set member. The admission of the new QoS flow is done by

releasing a QoS flow with lower ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority).

To trigger the preemption function, the PCI value of the new QoS flow must be set to

true.

A QoS flow can be a candidate for preemption if the following conditions apply:

- The PCI value of the QoS flow is set to true.
- The ARP of the QoS flow is lower than the ARP of the new QoS flow.

The preemption candidate QoS flow is selected from the same traffic set as the requested

QoS flow.

The traffic set member is determined based on the following conditions:

- If the traffic set member is defined with a single 5QI, a preemption candidate QoS flow is selected from the established QoS flows with the same 5QI value as the requested QoS flow.
- If the traffic set member is defined with a list of 5QIs, a preemption candidate QoS flow is selected from the established QoS flows with 5QI values within the list

If a preemption candidate QoS flow is selected, the requested QoS flow is admitted and

the preemption candidate QoS flow is released.

If the released QoS flow is the last QoS flow in a PDU session, the PDU session is

released.

If the released QoS flow is the last QoS flow in the last PDU session for a UE, the UE is

released.

If there is no preemption candidate QoS flow, the requested QoS flow is rejected.

## 3.1 Traffic Set Classification

Traffic set members can be defined with the following values:

- PLMN ID
- S-NSSAI
- SPID
- RFSP
- Deployment type

Traffic set members for PDU sessions can be defined with the following values:

- PLMN ID
- S-NSSAI

Traffic set members for QoS flows can be configured in NR standalone and EN-DC

deployments.

In NR standalone deployment, traffic set members can be configured with the same set of

the following values:

- PLMN ID
- S-NSSAI
- RFSP

In EN-DC deployment, traffic set members can be configured with the same set of the

following values:

- PLMN ID
- SPID

Limits on a cell level for one or more 5QI values can be configured with a different set

of the required values.

# 7 Activate Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012765 MO instance.
3. Unlock the cell.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012765 MO instance.
3. Unlock the cell.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 25.Q2.0: Secondary Node-Terminated DRB Support in EN-DC for Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption

This feature enhancement introduces support for the preemption of Secondary

Node-terminated DRBs in EN-DC deployment.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces support for the preemption of Secondary

Node-terminated DRBs in EN-DC deployment.

This feature enhancement also introduces a new MOM structure for the configuration of

the Service Adaptive Admission and Preemption feature and deprecates the current MOM

structure.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

GNBDUFunction.trafficDefinitionDepHEnabled attribute to

enable deprecation handling. The value of the

GNBDUFunction.trafficDefinitionDepHEnabled attribute is set

to true by default.

This feature enhancement deprecates the following MO classes:

- TrafficGroup
- TrafficGroups
- TrafficGroupMember

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO classes to replace the

deprecated MO classes:

- TrafficDefinition
- TrafficDefinitions
- TrafficSet
- TrafficSetMember

This feature enhancement deprecates the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.trafficGroupRef
- TrafficGroups.trafficGroupsId
- TrafficGroup.reservedBy
- TrafficGroup.trafficGroupId
- TrafficGroupMember.pLMNIdList
- TrafficGroupMember.sessionLimitRef
- TrafficGroupMember.sNSSAIList
- TrafficGroupMember.spidRfspList
- TrafficGroupMember.trafficCategory
- TrafficGroupMember.trafficGroupMemberId

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes to replace the

deprecated attributes:

- NRCellDU.trafficDefinitionRef
- TrafficDefinitions.trafficDefinitionsId
- TrafficDefinition.reservedBy
- TrafficDefinition.trafficDefinitionId
- TrafficSet.sessionLimitRef
- TrafficSet.trafficSetId
- TrafficSetMember.pLMNIdList
- TrafficSetMember.sNSSAIList
- TrafficSetMember.spidRfspList
- TrafficSetMember.trafficCategory
- TrafficSetMember.trafficSetMemberId

If the GNBDUFunction.trafficDefinitionDepHEnabled attribute is set

to true, updating any of the attributes under the

TrafficGroupMember MO class also updates the corresponding

attribute under the TrafficSet and the

TrafficSetMember MO classes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.2 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
