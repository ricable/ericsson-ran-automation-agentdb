Summary

The NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode feature reduces power consumption in a radio unit with low cell

load by muting part of the antenna array and putting related hardware components to

sleep. The feature monitors the cell load continuously by measuring PRB utilization

and the number of RRC-connected UEs. If the cell load is below the configured

threshold, part of the antenna array is muted automatically. If the cell load

increases above the configured threshold, the antenna branches are unmuted.

Hardware

The feature is supported on the following radio units:

- AIR 3255
- AIR 6428
- AIR 6472

Limitations

The feature supports NR standalone and EN-DC deployments.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode

The feature monitors cell load to reduce power consumption.

The feature is enabled by setting the

NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled attribute to

ENABLED. When the NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode feature is enabled, the

gNodeB continuously tracks the cell load. The gNodeB compares the cell load to the

operator-defined thresholds to decide whether to mute or unmute part of the antenna

array.

To enable detection mode, the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled

attribute must be set to DETECTION. Detection mode evaluates the

potential benefits of the feature without muting antenna branches. It also helps

configuring the feature with optimal threshold settings. No license is required to use

detection mode.

For more information on feature configuration, see Engineering Guidelines for NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Feature Operation of NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode

1. PRB utilization and the number of RRC-connected UEs in the cell are measured.
2. The collected data is averaged.
3. The averaged measurements are compared to the sleep thresholds set in the following attributes: Note: If the RRC-related thresholds are deactivated, only PRB utilization is used to determine the cell load.
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownPrbThreshDl
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownPrbThreshDlEco
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownPrbThreshUlEco
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownRrcConnThresh
    - MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownRrcConnThreshEco
4. If the cell load falls below the configured TX mute sleep state or eco mode sleep thresholds, one or both of the following timers are started: For TX mute sleep state, the MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownMonitorDurTimer timer is started. For eco mode, the MMimoSleepProfile.switchDownMonitorDurTimerEco timer is started.
5. If the cell load stays below the sleep threshold for the duration defined in the corresponding timer, the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute is automatically set to one of the following values: ECO If the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute is set to ECO\_PENDING for all sectors, the value is automatically set to ECO for all sectors, and part of the antenna array is muted. If the sleep thresholds for TX mute and eco mode overlap, eco mode takes priority. ECO\_PENDING If the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute is set to ECO\_PENDING for the sector, downlink branches are muted. TXMUTE If the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute is set to TXMUTE, downlink branches are muted for all sectors. If the sleep thresholds for TX mute and eco mode overlap, eco mode takes priority.
6. During the sleep duration, the PRB utilization and the number of RRC-connected UEs are continuously monitored.
7. The averaged measurements are compared to the wake-up thresholds set in the following attributes: MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpPrbThreshDl MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpPrbThreshDlEco MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpPrbThreshUlEco MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpRrcConnThresh MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpRrcConnThreshEco
8. If the cell load increases above one of the configured TX mute sleep state or eco mode wake-up thresholds, one or both of the following timers are started: For eco mode wake-up, the MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpMonitorDurTimerEco timer is started. For TX mute sleep state wake-up, the MMimoSleepProfile.switchUpMonitorDurTimer timer is started.
9. If the cell load stays above the wake-up threshold for the duration of the corresponding timer, the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute is automatically set to one of the following values: DEACTIVATED ECO ECO\_PENDING TXMUTE Note: In multi-carrier configuration, if the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute changes from ECO, the value of the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attribute is set to ECO\_PENDING for the other sector carriers if the sector carriers are still within the eco mode threshold.

# 7 Activate NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The NR Micro Sleep Tx feature is activated.
- The license key is installed in the node. Note: A license key is not required to use the detection mode of the feature.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012740 MO instance.
2. Set the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled attribute to a value other than DISABLED.
    - To be able to mute TX branches or part of the antenna array, set the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled attribute to ENABLED.
    - To be able to use the feature in detection mode, set the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled attribute to DETECTION.
3. Create a MMimoSleepProfile MO instance.
4. Create a MMimoSleepTimeGroup MO instance.
5. Create a MMimoSleepTimeWindow MO instance.
6. Set the attributes of the MMimoSleepTimeWindow MO instance to the desired values.
7. Set the attributes of the MMimoSleepProfile MO instance to the desired values.
8. Set the reference to the created MMimoSleepProfile MO instance in the created MMimoSleepTimeWindow MO instance.
9. Set the reference to the created MMimoSleepTimeWindow MO instance in the created MMimoSleepTimeGroup MO instance.
10. Set the reference to the created MMimoSleepTimeGroup MO instance in the NRSectorCarrier MO class.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepEnabled attribute to DISABLED.
2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012740 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode

The feature can be configured following a number of guidelines.

The feature can be configured based on the following guidelines:

- In eco mode, the last unlocked NRSectorCarrier MO on the radio unit can be locked by setting the corresponding NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED. Locking the NRSectorCarrier MO wakes up the radio unit, which causes a delay of about one and a half minutes in MO operation. During this time, the NRSectorCarrier MO cannot be unlocked.
- In eco mode, the NRSectorCarrier MO on the radio unit can be unlocked by setting the corresponding NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED. Unlocking the NRSectorCarrier MO wakes up the radio unit, which causes a delay of about three minutes in MO operation. During this time, the NRSectorCarrier MO cannot be locked. After completion, the value of the remaining NRSectorCarrier.massiveMimoSleepState attributes is automatically changed from ECO to ECO\_PENDING.
- One or more sleep time windows can be linked to one sleep time group.
- One sleep profile can be linked to one or more sleep time windows.
- The feature can be configured on a sector carrier level.
- The feature can be enabled on one or multiple cells on the node.

## 9.1 Detection Mode Configuration

It is recommended to use the feature in detection mode first to improve the

configuration of the feature with optimal threshold settings.

Detection mode can be used without a license to evaluate cell conditions and configure

the feature with optimal threshold settings.

The use of detection mode is recommended with a planning phase of one week. This planning

phase can be used to find the time intervals where the antenna branches can be put to

sleep to achieve the preferred level of power savings.

In the planning phase, the feature must be tuned to find the optimal balance between the

level of power savings and the level of performance degradation when in eco mode.

## 9.2 Sleep Time Window Configuration

Sleep time is configured through the MMimoSleepTimeWindow

MO.

The MMimoSleepTimeWindow.dayOfWeek attribute can be used to configure

the day or days during which the monitoring period is active. The start and end times of

the monitoring period can be configured through the

MMimoSleepTimeWindow.startTime and

MMimoSleepTimeWindow.stopTime attributes.

Separate monitoring periods can be set for each day. One or more monitoring periods can

be set for each day. During the monitoring period, the feature monitors PRB utilization

to determine when to activate eco mode.

The configured time window cannot cover more than one day. For example, to set a time

window from 22:00 on Wednesday to 04:00 on Thursday, two separate time windows must be

set from 22:00 to 23:59 on Wednesday and from 00:00 to 04:00 on

Thursday.

When configuring two time windows in the same MMimoSleepTimeGroup MO

class, the start of the second time window must be set to a time later than the end of

the first time window.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports AIR 3255 for the following energy efficiency

features:

- NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode
- NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode
- NR Micro Sleep Rx
- NR Micro Sleep Tx

Capacity and Performance

The NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode and NR Massive MIMO Eco Mode features can deactivate

antenna branches for radio units, which results in lower energy consumption of the

radio units.

Deactivating the antenna branches decreases the cell coverage, then degrades the

network performance. The actual degradation depends on the following factors:

- Network configuration
- Radio conditions
- Traffic load
