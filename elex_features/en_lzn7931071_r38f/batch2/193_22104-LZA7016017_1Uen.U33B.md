| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each                                     node. |

Summary

The feature enables the configuration of periodically triggered data collection of

coverage measurements from UEs. The following measurements associated with cells and

beams can be included:

- RSRP
- RSRQ
- SINR

The cell and beam measurements can be inter-frequency or intra-frequency,

serving up to eight neighboring cells.

This feature reduces operator effort on many network optimization scenarios, such as

introduction of new bands. It enhances flexibility to configure adequate periodic UE

measurements and receive UE reports in OSS for various external applications or

solutions, such as Cell shaping and Remote Electrical Tilt (RET). With this feature,

unbiased UE measurements are achieved by periodic trigger for UE measurements. It

has a smaller impact on UE performance compared to the Minimization of Drive Test

feature, due to taking inter-frequency measurements when UE is inactive. It also

helps achieve less filtering of events by receivers by the dedicated PM event.

# 2 Dependencies of NR UE Coverage Measurements

The feature is related to other features that perform UE measurements.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature is supported on Ericsson gNodeBs and applicable to NR SA only. In case of

NR-DC deployment,

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature can be initiated only

by MgNB.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR UE Coverage Measurements

The feature collects and provides UE

measurements that can be used to monitor and detect coverage problems in the network thereby

increasing efficiency in network optimization cases.

The measurements are collected according to 3GPP TS 38.331 for the serving cells of the

UE and up to eight neighbor cells. The following data is collected:

- PCI of the serving cells and the neighbor cells
- RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR of the serving cells
- RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR of the neighbor cells for NR
- RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR of the neighbor cells for E-UTRAN

The following measurement types are supported:

- Inter-frequency NR
- Intra-frequency NR
- Inter-RAT frequency E-UTRAN

The following attributes can be used for feature configuration:

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence of NR UE Coverage

Measurements

1. The operator configures the measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature in the gNodeB according to MOM capabilities.
2. The UE inactivity is determined in the gNodeB and the UE is selected for measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature.
3. The gNodeB configures the UE to perform the measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature by sending the RRCReconfiguration message. For each UE, the gNodeB configures the maximum number of NR and E-UTRAN frequencies to perform the measurements based on the UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas attribute.
4. The UE confirms the RRC connection reconfiguration with the RRCReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE is reconfigured and performs all configured measurements.
6. The UE sends the measurement results to the gNodeB in the MeasurementReport message.Note: The total number of UE measurement reports that can be received from the UE can be significant. It depends on the following parameter settings: The UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas attribute determines the maximum number of NR and E-UTRAN frequencies to measure on The reportAmount struct member of the UcmNrFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodical attribute determines the number of reports that can be received for each NR frequency The reportAmount struct member of the UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodicalEutran attribute determines the number of reports that can be received for each E-UTRAN frequency If the value of the UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas attribute is set to 7 and the value of one the following attributes is set to 2: UcmNrFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodical UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodicalEutran the gNodeB can expect a total of 14 measurement reports from the UE, calculated as 7 times 2.
7. The CuCpUeUcmNrReport and the CuCpUeUcmEutranReport PM events are generated at reception of the last measurement report and they are sent to OSS.

If the NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature is active, measurements for the

NR UE Coverage Measurements feature remain ongoing for the NR Security-Initiated UE

Measurements feature even if the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature is deactivated.

Both features must be deactivated for measurements for the NR UE Coverage

Measurements feature to be deactivated.

## 3.1 UE Inactivity Determination

A different set of conditions are evaluated for UE inactivity determination based on

whether an RRC-state preference indication is received in a UAI message.

The overall UE activity state can be changed from RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_INACTIVE or

RRC\_IDLE if the following conditions are met:

- The NAS timer is expired.
- Sn bearer inactivity is reported.
- Inactivity on all bearers is detected.
- The UE is not performing measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature.

If an RRC state preference indication is received in a UAI message, an

alternate set of conditions are evaluated for UE inactivity. In this case, the overall

UE activity state can be changed from RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_INACTIVE or RRC\_IDLE only if

the following conditions are met:

- A valid UAI release preference indication is reported.
- The UE is not performing measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature.

UEs that are about to change the RRC\_CONNECTED activity state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE

might be used to perform UE coverage measurements. A UE that is selected to perform a

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature does not change UE

activity state from ACTIVE to INACTIVE while it is performing

the

measurements for the time determined by timer tUcm.

## 3.2 UE Selection

If the following conditions are met, all UEs that become inactive might be selected for

performing the

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- UE capability indicates that the UE can perform measurement on at least one frequency. The UE needs to support frequencies as indicated by supportedBandListNR IE in UE-NR-Capability under rf-Parameters or supportedBandListEUTRA IE in UE-NR-Capability under interRAT-Parameters.
- The UE belongs to an NR cell for which measurements for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature are configured by setting the UcmCellProfile.ucmEnabled attribute to true.
- The UE has not already performed a measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature previously during the same UE inactivity. Only one measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature is allowed for each UE inactivity state.
- The probability for an inactive UE to be selected for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature, which is the value of the UcmCellProfile.ucmSelectionProbability attribute, allows measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature to start on that UE.

## 3.3 UE Coverage Measurements Intensity Determination

The intensity that

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature is started on a given NR

frequency is decided by the following steps:

1. By setting the value of the UcmCellProfile.ucmCellTargetIntensity attribute, it is determined how often measurement for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature needs to be started in certain NR cell.
2. By setting the value of the UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor or UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor attribute, it is determined how much more often the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature needs to be started on a particular NR or E-UTRAN frequency.

The values of the UcmCellProfile.ucmCellTargetIntensity,

UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor,

and the UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor

attributes are verified against CPU load protection to finally determine the number of

NR or E-UTRAN

frequencies that can be configured for

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature on the UE.

The total number of NR

and E-UTRAN

frequencies that can be configured for

measurement

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature in one second cannot

exceeded 100.

## 3.4 Timer tUCM

The timer tUCM delays changing the UE RRC\_CONNECTED activity state from ACTIVE to

INACTIVE in gNodeB while waiting for measurement reports to be received from UE.

tUCM duration can be calculated using the following timer formula:

tUCM = initial\_meas + max[(ucmReportAmount\_fi

-1)*ucmReportInterval\_fi]

In the formula:

| initial_meas         |    | initial_meas = 200 ms + n×480 ms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

# 4 Network Impact of NR UE Coverage Measurements

The feature provides

configuration of periodic data collection of coverage measurements from UEs and reporting

them as PM events.

Capacity and Performance

When using this feature,

the

last received measurement report from a UE generates a PM event

CuCpUeUcmNrReport or

CuCpUeUcmEutranReport and increases the

load in the gNodeB. The increasing number of PM events also increases the load on

the transport network when they are transmitted to the ENM.

Interfaces

The feature increases the load on the Uu interface in the following situations:

- UE measurements are initiated or terminated
- The UE sends measurement reports to the gNodeB

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR UE Coverage Measurements

As

measurements

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature can be used by various

features at the same time, the following point needs to be considered during

configuration:

- Because only one RRCReconfiguration message can be sent to UE to order UE to perform measurements, UE measurement configuration requirements of all features need to be coordinated on the gNodeB level, such as the definition of MOM configuration for cell using the UcmCellProfile attributes, corresponding NR frequencies using the UcmNrFreqRelProfile attributes, and corresponding E-UTRAN frequencies using the UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile attributes.

The PM counter NRCellCU.pmSaUeMeasurementReportUcm counts the number

of received

reports

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature. If the number of received

reports

for the NR UE

Coverage Measurements feature needs to be decreased, consider

decreasing values of the following cell-level attributes in

configuration

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- UcmCellProfile.ucmCellTargetIntensity
- UcmCellProfile.ucmSelectionProbability
- UcmCellProfileUeCfg.ucmMaxFreqLayerToMeas

The following frequency-level attributes under the UcmNrFreqRelProfile

and

UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile

MO

classes

can also be considered for decreasing the number of received

reports

for the NR UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor
- ReportConfigPeriodical.reportAmount
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor
- ReportConfigPeriodicalEutran.reportAmount

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The periodic trigger for UE measurement provides unbiased UE measurements for E-UTRAN.
- Taking measurements when the UE is inactive has less impact on UE performance.
- The target measurement intensity is configurable for each cell.
- Dedicated PM events mean less filtering of events by receivers.
- This common data source for the collection of UE measurements can be used for the development of off-node features.

Capacity and Performance

Using the framework of the

NR

UE Coverage Measurements feature generates RRC signaling between

the RBS and the UE, which increases the load on the Uu interface. The load is

increased when UE measurements are initiated and terminated, and when the UE sends

measurement reports to the RBS.

When using the

NR

UE Coverage Measurements feature,

the

last received measurement report from a UE generates a PM event

and increases the load in the RBS.

The increasing number of PM events also increases the load on the transport network

when they are transmitted to the ENM.

Operation

This feature

enhancement introduces

the

following MO class and

attributes

for configuration of

the NR UE

Coverage Measurements

feature

for

E-UTRAN:

- EUtranFreqRelation.ucmEUtranFreqRelProfileRef
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.reportConfigPeriodicalEutran
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.reservedBy
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmEUtranFreqRelProfileId
- UcmEUtranFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor

This feature

enhancement introduces

the

following PM

events

for the

reports

received from

UEs for the NR

UE Coverage Measurements feature:

- CuCpUeUcmNrReport
- CuCpUeUcmEutranReport

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.1 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier ENM

versions.
