No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Signed Software

The feature improves the security against malicious software, and ensures that only

the software that contains a valid Ericsson signature is allowed to be installed on the

node.

Ericsson software is protected from intrusion by digital signatures. The digital

signatures are recognized by Ericsson hardware, so that the unit must have authorized

software. In exceptional circumstances, Ericsson can revoke the certificates used for

verifying the digital signatures. New certificates are then introduced in a new Upgrade

Package (UP) delivered by Ericsson.

Certificate revocation is done by the following procedure:

- A new UP containing a certificate revocation list and new certificates is delivered by Ericsson.
- A grace period is initiated when the upgrade is confirmed. Note: New UPs cannot be activated during the grace period. The duration of the grace period is defined by the SwSigningCertM.crlGracePeriodTimer parameter.
- The operator is informed that the grace period is ongoing by the Software Management CRL Pending alarm.
- The SwSigningCertM.crlGracePeriodExpiration attribute is set to "The system is in the software signing certificate revocation grace period, which expires at [DateAndTime]". Restarting or powering down the board does not prevent the grace period from expiring.

# 4 Parameters for Signed Software

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following security benefits:

- Nodes cannot be upgraded with software without a valid certificate
- Nodes cannot be upgraded to Upgrade Package without Signed SW CRL
- Rollbacks to a SW signed by a revoked certificate is rejected
- Compliance with the latest security requirements from NCSC and 3GPP

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Upgrade and manual installation are not possible on

the

node if the SSW CRL is missing in the EE.

The following attributes are introduced:

- SwSigningCertM.crlGracePeriodTimer
- SwSigningCertM.crlGracePeriodTimerExpiration

The

SwSigningCertM.confirmCrl

action is introduced to stop the SSW CRL grace period timer and confirm the new SSW

CRL.

The following alarms are introduced with the feature

enhancement:

- Software Management CRL Pending alarm
- Software Management Certificate Expiration alarm

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 23.04 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.
