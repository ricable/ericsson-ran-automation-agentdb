The Radio Dot System NR consists of the following:

- one of the following types of Radio Dots: a high capacity single band Dot (Dot 4459, Dot 4469, Dot 4479, Dot 4489, Dot 4479 B78K, Dot 4489 B78K) a dual band Dot (Dot 2272, Dot 2282, Dot 2274, Dot 2284, Dot 4474, or Dot 4484) a tri-band Dot (Dot 4455, Dot 4465, Dot 4475, or Dot 4485)
- an Indoor Radio Unit (IRU 8844, IRU 8846, IRU 8848, IRU 8884, IRU 1649, or IRU 1648)

The IRU and Radio Dots are connected through a shielded CAT6A cable or hybrid cable

carrying IQ streams, proprietary control link, and power over Ethernet for the Radio

Dot. This link is of Ethernet type.

NR comes with two paths to 5G: NR Non-standalone (NSA) and NR Standalone (SA). Operators

can opt for either (or both) when transitioning from 4G to 5G.

- The NR NSA option allows operators to leverage their existing 4G network assets rather than deploying a completely new end-to-end 5G network. The initial NR deployments are based on NR NSA Option 3X that supports the deployment solution E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC). Option 3x represents a network with both LTE and NR radio access, whereby control plane traffic is always processed through the EPC core of LTE, and both LTE and NR are used for user data traffic (user plane). Terminals supporting dual connectivity are always connected to LTE RAN, and can connect to the NR RAN, if available. The terminals can have multiple Radio Access Bearers (RABs) simultaneously with corresponding Data Radio Bearer (DRBs) for different services. The NR RAN boosts network performance for NR-capable UEs.
- The NR SA option 2, which does not rely on LTE, includes a new radio along with the 5GC (IP-based core network between the RAN and other networks), comprising virtualized cloud-native architecture (CNA) that introduces new ways to develop, deploy, and manage services. The NR Standalone (SA) network can be deployed independently or together with an existing LTE or NR NSA network.

There are three possible types of UEs (LTE UE, EN-DC Capable UE, and NR SA UE) with

varied network capabilities. Within the supported networks, the UE selects the default

network to camp on. SA UEs and EN-DC capable UEs are backwards compatible.

Capacity and Performance

For Radio Dot capacity and performance information, refer to Radio Dot

Description in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library.

For IRU capacity and performance information, refer to Indoor Radio Unit

Description in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library.

Operation

Radio Dot System NR currently supports four layers. For TDD with RDS, a single Baseband

6630 connected to six IRUs can support six NR cells. Each IRU supports one sector

carrier. Each sector carrier supports one NR radio cell with a maximum of 20 MHz, 30

MHz, 40 MHz, 50 MHz, 60 MHz, 70 MHz, 80 MHz, 90 MHz, or 100 MHz carrier bandwidth.

The NR Downlink Aggregation feature, FAJ 121 5201, enables higher downlink data

throughput by aggregating the bandwidth of multiple component carriers to serve a

carrier aggregation-capable UE. A maximum of two NR CCs can be aggregated.

When the LTE-NR Downlink Aggregation feature, FAJ 121 4912, is enabled, different user

plane data can be sent in downlink on the Primary Cell Group (PCG) and Secondary Cell

Group (SCG) radio resources of the secondary node terminated split bearer. The

combination of up to six LTE carriers with one NR carrier in Low-Band or Mid-Band

results in higher user speed in the network when using split bearers. The LTE-NR

Downlink Aggregation feature maximizes the coverage and the end user throughput. It also

handles imbalance and variations in capacity and delay on both the MCG and SCG radio

resources.

The Radio Dot System NR reuses the existing architecture, offers the same ease of

installation and flexibility allowing for easy upgrades from existing Radio Dot Systems,

and maintains functional parity and integration with Ericsson Radio System.

Mixed Mode

RDS supports FDD and TDD Mixed Mode.

For detailed information about Mixed Mode support in RDS, refer to Multi-Standard

Mixed Mode in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library..

Ericsson Spectrum Sharing (ESS)

Ericsson Spectrum Sharing (ESS) enables the introduction of NR in a spectrum used by LTE

FDD. ESS dynamically shares spectrum and same bandwidth between LTE and 5G based on

traffic demand.

For detailed information about ESS support in RDS, refer to Ericsson Spectrum

Sharing (ESS) in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library..

Hardware

The access side requires the use of specific Basebands, radios, and Radio Dots for the

LTE side and for NR side, respectively.

For details on supported hardware and compatibility, refer to Radio Dot System

Compatibility Matrix in the Radio Dot System (RDS) library.
