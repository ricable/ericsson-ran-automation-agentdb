Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To benefit from the feature, the UE must support

EN-DC

or

High-Band standalone deployment.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage Extension High-Band

Msg3 HARQ in High-Band

Using the HARQ procedure on Msg3 PUSCH allows the UE to retransmit Msg3 multiple

times. Because of this, the gNodeB has more possibilities to

successfully decode transmissions and the initial Random Access procedure does not

have to be restarted.

The ra-ContentionResolutionTimer period starts with the

transmission of Msg3. Before the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer

period expires, the gNodeB can transmit DCI 0\_0, which triggers the

UE to retransmit Msg3. This increases the Msg3 decoding success rate through soft

combining. Msg3 contains the TC-RNTI received in Msg2.

Beam Refinement Optimization

Beam refinement is improved in the following ways:

- The number of UCI bits is reduced. This reduction is achieved by limiting the number of beams in a CSI report from three to one. For radios and radio configurations that have eight or less narrow beams for each wide beam, UCI bits can also be reduced by limiting the number of CSI reports from two to one. For more information, see Enhanced Beam Management High-Band.
- The UCI that carries the CSI report is transmitted without uplink scheduling.

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage Extension High-Band

The feature can increase cell coverage and robustness, and improve

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Msg3 HARQ in High-Band increases the access performance of the system and provides

improved coverage on the cell edge.

The reduced number of UCI bits use all available REs on PUSCH for UCI. Because of

this, coding performance and coverage is increased.

Msg5 handling is improved by reducing the number of PRBs from eight to two. Because

of this,  PRBs retain more power and coverage is increased. The enhanced Msg5

handling can also transmission algorithm can improve improve Msg5 success rate and

robustness.

PUCCH format 2 allows for improved coverage and the dynamic selection of two to six

PRBs for a transmission. The improved PUCCH format 2 coverage increases downlink

data throughput on the cell edge.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Events

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

Benefits

The enhancement increases the Msg3 decoding success rate through soft combining. In

addition, the enhancement has beneficial impact on the Accessibility KPI.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement increases the access performance of the system and provides improved

coverage on the cell border.

Operation

The performance of the functionality is observable by the Random Access Success Rate

Captured in a gNodeB KPI. This KPI specifies how often Msg2 transmissions result in

a successfully transmitted Msg3.

For more information, see Key Performance Indicators.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The enhancement requires an EN-DC-capable UE.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q1: PUCCH Optimization

This feature enhancement increases PUCCH format 2 coverage by up to 3 dB by

increasing the maximum number of allocated PRBs to six.

| Feature Name:           | Coverage Extension High-Band   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4962                   |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                   |

High-Band feature. As this feature supports a large number of SR and HARQ-ACK bits

transmitted, it also enables the maximum number of PRBs to be allocated for PUCCH

format 2.

Capacity and Performance

The improved coverage allows the increase of downlink data throughput at the cell

edge.

Operation
