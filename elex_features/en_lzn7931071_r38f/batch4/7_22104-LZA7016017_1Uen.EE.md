Standalone-capable UE.

# 4 Feature Operation of Physical Layer Mid-Band

The Physical Layer Mid-Band feature encompasses the operation of control and data

procedures.

The feature-related procedures require the following types of network elements:

- Physical resources
- Physical signals
- Physical channels

The supported time domain and frame structure enable the functioning of these

network elements.

Time Domain Structure

The Physical Layer Mid-Band feature supports Time Division Duplex (TDD) with normal

cyclic prefix.

Table 2   Time Domain Signal Structure with Normal Cyclic Prefix

| Structure Element   | Length [ms]   | Description           |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Frame               | 10            |                       |
| Subframe            | 1             | 1 frame =10 subframes |
| Slot                | 1/2µ          | 1 subframe = 2µ slots |
| OFDM symbol         | 1/(14×2µ)     | 1 slot = 14 symbols   |

For the Physical Layer Mid-Band feature, only μ = 1 (30 kHz subcarrier spacing) is

supported.

Frame Structure

In TDD, downlink and uplink are transmitted on the same frequency. The resources are

divided in time on slot level between the uplink and the downlink.

The following functions are supported:

- Different TDD patterns with a guard period.
- The semi-static downlink and uplink assignment is communicated to the UE through RRC signaling.

A downlink slot, signaled to a UE, has the following structure:

- PDCCH in the first symbol
- 13 PDSCH symbols in slots without a guard period
- Tracking Reference Signal (TRS) multiplexed with PDSCH in some slots

One of the two following options can constitute an uplink slot from a UE:

- PRACH
- 14 symbols PUSCH
- 14 symbols PUCCH

For more information about the supported functions on Mid-Band TDD, see Control Channel Guideline NR.

The feature only supports a specific set of Time Division Duplex (TDD) patterns. The

following TDD patterns are supported on CPRI and eCPRI radios.

- 3 downlink + 1 uplink (default)
- 4 downlink + 1 uplink
- 4 downlink + 1 uplink + 3 downlink + 2 uplink
- 4 downlink + 2 uplink + 4 downlink
- 8 downlink + 2 uplink

TDD patterns are associated with special slot configurations. A special slot

configuration can contain the following symbols within one slot:

- Downlink
- Uplink
- Guard

LTE-NR Coexistence

There can be a coexisting LTE network in the same geographical area or region. LTE-NR

coexistence occurs if LTE and NR carriers are located within the same frequency

band. Carriers within the same frequency band can overlap, can be adjacent or

located further away. In each case where LTE and NR carriers are located within the

same frequency band, the NR TDD pattern must be synchronized with the LTE TDD

pattern for macro networks. Synchronized TDD patterns require equal N\_TA offsets.

The value setting for the LTE N\_TA offset is circa 20 μs. The value of the NR N\_TA

offset must be adapted to the value of the LTE N\_TA offset.

The NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute must be set to identical

values for all NR cells sharing a TDD or an FDD radio unit. The attribute must be

set to true when LTE and NR carriers are in the same frequency

band. It must be set to false when only NR carriers are located in

the frequency band.

Physical Channels

## 4.1 Physical Resources

Physical resources concern information related to antenna ports, Resource Elements

and Resource Blocks. Characteristics of the NR cell and bandwidth parts are also

described.

Antenna Port

An antenna port is defined by its associated channel or signal.

The supported set of antenna ports depends on the signal configuration in the

cell.

Resource Element and Resource Block

One OFDM symbol is the smallest time domain unit. A subcarrier is the smallest

frequency domain unit. One OFDM symbol in a single subcarrier is called a Resource

Element.

A Resource Block is defined as 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency

domain.

NR Cell

The NR cell involves the following characteristics:

- Defined by the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) information.
- Supports cell bandwidth up to 100 MHz.

The PCI is for cell identification on the physical layer

and determined by the SSB. The UE uses the PCI to decode physical layer data

transmitted by the gNodeB.

The PCI of an NR cell is configured by using the

NRCellDU.nRPCI attribute.

The PCI must be planned to achieve dual connectivity and

optimal radio network performance. To avoid performance degradation, unique PCIs

must be configured within the same site and as neighbors and neighbors of

neighbors.

Bandwidth Parts

A single Bandwidth Part (BWP) is defined as equivalent to the cell bandwidth.

A BWP is a contiguous set of resource blocks. It entails the following

characteristics:

- A BWP is associated with a numerology.
- PDCCH, PUCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH and DMRS within a BWP share the same numerology.
- A UE is limited to one active BWP at a time.

## 4.2 Physical Signals

Besides physical resources and physical channels, physical signals are also part of

the physical layer.

The downlink physical signals are shown in Table 4.

Table 4   Downlink Physical Signals

| Signal                                         | Mid-Band      |

### 4.2.1 Synchronization Signals

The Synchronization Signal and the PBCH Block constitute the SSB.

The SSB defines an NR cell in which it is used for frame synchronization.

Synchronization Signal and PBCH Block (SSB)

The SSB consists of the following signal types:

- Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS)
- Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS)
- PBCH (including DMRS)

The SSB features the following characteristics:

- One SSB is transmitted every 20 ms. The SSB can be configured with the NRCellDU.ssbPeriodicity attribute.
- One SSB occupies 20 Resource Blocks over four consecutive OFDM symbols.
- Mid-Band supports 30 kHz subcarrier spacing.

NR cell search is based on the SSB. It involves the following functions:

- The UE performs matched filtering to find the PSS.
- The UE detects the SSS in the frequency domain.

The SSB Power Boost feature can increase the SSB

transmission power in Mid-Band. Increased SSB power enables the faster setup and

better coverage of SCG radio resources.

The NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band feature can be used to shift

SSBs in the time domain. Time-shifted SSBs reduce the interference from PDSCH and

neighbor cell SSBs.

#### 4.2.1.1 Synchronization Signal Block Configuration Parameters

The SSB defines an NR cell in which it is used for frame

synchronization. An SSB consists of the following elements that contain subcarriers:

- PSS
- SSS
- PBCH

The following attributes of the NRCellDU MO are used to configure the

SSB parameters for an NR cell:

| NRCellDU.ssbFrequency         |    | Represents the NR-ARFCN that is associated with the SSB                                                                                                  |

After unlocking the cell, the start of SSB transmission is indicated by the following

attribute values:

- The NRCellDU.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.
- The NRCellDU.serviceState attribute is set to IN\_SERVICE.

### 4.2.2 Tracking Reference Signal

The feature uses TRS for synchronization. This signal type also provides information

related to channel estimation and demodulation. TRS periodicity can be configured with the

help of a dedicated attribute.

Unlike LTE, NR does not use the Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS). Hence, TRS is

introduced for fine synchronization to perform the following:

- Synchronization in time and frequency.
- Providing doppler and delay spread information required for channel estimation and demodulation.

TRS is realized using periodic CSI-RS resources. The periodicity of TRS can be

configured for each cell by the NRCellDU.trsPeriodicity attribute.

The attribute is set to 40 ms by default in Mid-Band. In each period, TRS is mapped to

two symbols in two consecutive slots. The TRS power relative to PDSCH is controlled by

the NRCellDU.trsPowerBoosting attribute. Power boosting is realized

by the configuration of periodic ZP-CSI-RS resources in the TRS symbols.

### 4.2.3 CSI Reference Signal

In addition to the CSI-RS resources configured for TRS,

CSI-RS is also configured for CSI acquisition.

A periodic CSI-RS resource is configured for channel

measurements. The periodicity of the CSI-RS transmission is configured by the

NRCellDU.csiRsPeriodicity attribute. The CSI-RS resource spans

all of the Resource Blocks of the BWP. The CSI-RS resource contains 2, 4 or 8 ports, and

occupies 1× 2, 1× 4 or 2 × 4 Resource Elements respectively in the slot of every

Resource Block.

In addition to the CSI-RS, a CSI-IM resource with the same

transmission periodicity is configured for interference measurements. The CSI-IM

resource spans all the Resource Blocks of the BWP. It occupies 2 × 2 Resource Elements

in the slot of each Resource Block.

Aperiodic CSI reporting is used, where the CSI report is

multiplexed on PUSCH. The UE is configured to report CSI according to the type 1

single-panel codebook. In addition, the wideband Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) and

the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) are used.

For details on the configuration of 2-, 4-, and 8-port CSI-RS, see the CSI-RS

Resource Configuration for the NR Cell section in Manage Radio Network.

Additional licensing also allows the configuration of 16- and 32-port CSI-RS resources.

For more information on these configuration options, see the Feature

Operation section of Massive MIMO Mid-Band.

For the mapping options of CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs to Physical Resources, see Control Channel Guideline.

### 4.2.4 Sounding Reference Signal

The Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band and the Advanced Downlink Multi-User

MIMO Mid-Band features both use SRS. With the help of SRS, the gNodeB can estimate the

downlink channel between the UE and the gNodeB, which is used for beamforming in the

PDSCH.

The following characteristics apply to both periodic and aperiodic SRS:

- SRS is configured with the use of antenna switching.
- On RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units in RAN Compute group 5 and higher, up to 16 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.
- On other RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units, up to 8 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.
- The SRS power, that is the p0 nominal value, is configured with the NRCellDU.pZeroNomSrs attribute.
- Since SRSs are scheduled in unused uplink symbols in special slots, resources are not taken from PUSCH data. Because of this, the SRS does not cause any extra overhead for PUSCH.

Periodic SRS

For periodic SRS, a UE can be configured with a RRCReconfiguration

message to periodically transmit the SRS in the uplink over the configured

bandwidth.

The following characteristics apply to the periodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- A full-band SRS resource spans one uplink OFDM symbol in a special slot.
- A half-band SRS resource spans two uplink OFDM symbols in a special slot.
- Periodicity is with 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 slots. The default periodicity is 40 slots.
- SRS periodicity can be controlled through the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute. This attribute can be used to balance the number of UEs configured for SRS against the throughput gain for each UE.

Aperiodic SRS

For aperiodic SRS, the gNodeB triggers a UE to transmit aperiodic SRS on demand

through DCI format 1\_1. The UE is triggered to transmit SRS aperiodically depending

on the demand in terms of UE traffic.

The following characteristics apply to the aperiodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- Four uplink symbols need to be configured in the special subframe.
- The first and third symbol for uplink in the special slot can be configured for aperiodic SRS.
- The ports configured in the uplink symbols for carrying SRS are dynamically shared among the active aperiodic SRS users.
- Half-band SRS is not supported for aperiodic SRS.

channels and shared channels.

The following physical channels are specified to carry downlink control information for

NR:

- Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)
- Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)

For downlink data transmission, the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is used.

The following physical channels are specified to carry uplink control information for

NR:

- Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)
- Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)

For uplink data transmission, the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) is used.

### 4.3.1 Downlink Channels

The feature uses different physical channels to carry downlink control information

and for downlink data transmission.

The feature uses the following downlink channels:

| PDCCH   |    | The PDCCH carries downlink control information, for example, scheduling                             assignments.      |
|---------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         |    |                                                                                                                       |
| PDSCH   |    | The PDSCH carries the downlink transport block.                                                                       |
|         |    |                                                                                                                       |
| PBCH    |    | The PBCH carries part of the system information required by the UE to                             access the network. |

#### 4.3.1.1 PDCCH

The PDCCH carries downlink control information, for example, scheduling

assignments.

PDCCH carries the Downlink Control Information, mapped to PDCCH in the first symbol in

every downlink slot. This is realized by the configuration of a Common Search Space and

a UE-Specific Search Space. Both search spaces have a monitoring periodicity of one slot

with the duration of one symbol.

The supported aggregation levels of the PDCCH candidates depend on the cell bandwidth,

and can reach up to 16 Control Channel Elements (CCE).

Downlink time and frequency resources for PDCCH are allocated in the form of a Control

Channel Resource Set (CORESET). In NR SA, the following types of CORESET can be

configured:

- CORESET#0 is configured for the Common Search Space.
- CORESET#1 is configured for the UE-Specific Search Space.

In EN-DC, the CORESET types have the following configuration:

- CORESET#0 is not configured for the PDCCH, because LTE is used for common control signaling.
- CORESET#1 is configured for both the Common Search Space and the UE-Specific Search Space.

For more information about CORESETs, see Manage Radio Network.

PDCCH Link Adaptation is used to adjust the number of PDCCH CCEs dynamically. PDCCH CCEs

are allocated for DCI transmission in user-specific control signaling. The number of

CCEs transmitted for the PDCCH is based on

the channel

quality and the DCI

size.

#### 4.3.1.2 PDSCH

The PDSCH carries the downlink transport block.

The PDSCH supports the following:

- Modulation up to 256-QAM
- Multiple MIMO layers for CPRI and eCPRI radios

Resource allocation is performed in the frequency domain using type 0 resource

allocation (bitmap). In the time domain, the resource allocation of PDSCH is done by DCI

in the same slot, using type A PDSCH mapping. The PDSCH aggregation factor equals one.

This means that a DCI schedules one PDSCH in one slot only.

#### 4.3.1.3 PBCH

The PBCH carries part of the system information required by the UE to access the

network.

Together with the PSS and the SSS, PBCH forms an SSB or PBCH block. The PBCH block is

part of the initial access procedure.

### 4.3.2 Uplink Channels

PUCCH carries uplink control information. PUSCH carries the uplink transport block

and uplink control information. PRACH is used for random access and allows the gNodeB to estimate the delay between itself and the

UE.

PUCCH

PUCCH carries the following types of uplink control information:

- HARQ-ACKs and HARQ-NACKs
- Scheduling Requests (SRs)

PUCCH resources are configured with the following characteristics:

- 14 symbol length
- PUCCH formats 1 and 3
- Intra-slot frequency hopping

PUSCH

PUSCH carries the uplink transport block. It supports up to 64-QAM in the uplink by

default. The 256-QAM modulation scheme is supported if the 256-QAM Uplink Low/Mid-Band feature is active. One MIMO

layer is enabled by default for each UE, using the codebook-based transmission

scheme. The number of MIMO layers can be increased up to four in each cell if the

Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band feature is active.

Transmission with transform precoding disabled is supported.This means that the

CP-OFDM waveform is used. The DFTS-OFDM waveform can be used if the DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink feature is active.

For resource allocation in the frequency domain, type 1 resource allocation (start or

length) is used. In the time domain, resource allocation for PUSCH is performed by

DCI at least two slots in advance. Type A PUSCH mapping is used in the time domain.

The PUSCH aggregation factor equals one, which means that the DCI schedules one

PUSCH in one slot only. IRC receiver processing is used to mitigate uplink

interference.

PRACH

PRACH carries the RACH preamble sequences. PRACH can be configured with the following

characteristics:

- Preamble format B4 with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing or format 0 with 1.25kHz subcarrier spacing. Format 0 can be used if the PRACH Enhancements Mid-Band feature is active.
- One RACH occasion every 10 ms.
- 16 random access preambles in each RACH occasion.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 8 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## Appendix A.i: 20.Q2: NR PDCCH Link Adaptation

The functionality allows to dynamically adjust the number of Control Channel Elements

(CCEs).

|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4905                 | FAJ 121 5037                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Low/Mid-Band Base Package | NR Low/Mid-Band Base Package |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002/5LM R3          | FAJ 801 4002/5LM R3          |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | NR                           | NR                           |

The functionality enables dynamic adjustment in the number of CCEs allocated for the

transmission of Downlink Control Information (DCI) in user-specific control signaling.

In addition, the functionality allows for using the maximum number of available CCEs on

each bandwidth.

Capacity and Performance

NR PDCCH Link Adaptation can improve coverage for user-specific control signaling. It

uses channel quality measurements to provide the optimal number of PDCCH CCEs. The

functionality can impact capacity in terms of Scheduling Entities (SEs) each TTI. In

a typical cell deployment, overall capacity improvement is expected. It is also

possible that most devices are in poor radio conditions, requiring the allocation of

higher PDCCH CCE aggregation levels. In such cases, capacity cannot be improved.

However, the improvement in coverage does not occur if the overall coverage is

limited by the following elements:

- PDCCH Common Search Space (CSS)
- Other physical channels and signals

The PDCCH CCE aggregation levels are selected with a target of 1% BLER. In this way,

the functionality enables the allocation of smaller CCE aggregation levels and can

improve capacity.

Operation

The functionality is part of the basic deployment. It does not require feature

activation. New MOM parameters are not introduced.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.
