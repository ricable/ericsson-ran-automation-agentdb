# 1 NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension Overview

The feature enables downlink carrier aggregation of the FDD and TDD spectrum. This

feature can enhance the coverage associated with the TDD spectrum by combining it with an

FDD SpCell in carrier aggregation

configuration. The use

of both FDD and TDD spectrum resources improves system performance and end-user

experience.

Summary

The feature enables carrier aggregation between FDD and TDD component carriers with

the following characteristics:

- 15 kHz Subcarrier Spacing (SCS) for FR1 FDD
- 30 kHz SCS for FR1 TDD

Possible band combinations are defined by 3GPP TS 38.101-1.

When the FDD mode NR operating band frequency is lower than the TDD mode frequency,

an improved link budget can occur for FDD carriers compared to TDD carriers. The

improvement depends on the spectrum gap, which is the frequency distance between

carriers.

The feature uses the uplink of the FDD carrier, so the TDD downlink coverage can be

extended at large spectrum gaps between FDD and TDD carriers. This leads to improved

downlink user data rates. A UE can be served by the FDD uplink with larger coverage

range while benefiting from the substantial downlink performance boost provided by

the TDD carrier.

The downlink performance of the TDD carriers is improved compared to the traditional

coverage point of a TDD carrier not used in carrier aggregation with FDD.

Figure 1   Extending TDD Coverage

The feature supports SpCell mobility and SCell mobility for UEs

configured with

carrier

aggregation.

The following SCell management methods are supported:

- SCell activation based on A1 measurements
- SCell deactivation based on A2 measurements
- Intra-frequency SCell change based on A6 measurements

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- Maximum two NR component carriers can be aggregated.
- The SpCell must be FDD mode. TDD mode SpCell is not supported.
- When the RadioEquipmentClock.bfnOffset is applied, the offset value must be the same for both partner nodes.
- 5QI cannot be transferred from the SpCell to the ESCell in case of inter-Baseband NR carrier aggregation in the downlink.
- The feature is not supported where the SpCell has 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured and the SCells have more than 1TX/1RX number of antennas configured.
- In case lock or unlock of TermPointToGNodeB MO is performed during an ongoing NR Carrier Aggregation session with FDD and TDD, then the SCell is not activated again during the ongoing session.
- In external SCells, the UE throughput might decrease in sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use the component carriers because of reaching the reservation limits on the PDCCH and PUCCH.

Network Requirements

- The UE must support downlink CA as specified in the subparts of 3GPP TS 38.101.
- A CA-capable UE must support at least one of the configured SCell bands on the node, otherwise the UE cannot be configured with CA.

## 2.1 Downlink Carrier Aggregation Features in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The NR downlink carrier aggregation features in Low-Band and Mid-Band use the same

SCell selection algorithm.

If a carrier aggregation feature with a higher number of component carriers is enabled,

the carrier aggregation features with a lower number of component carriers are also

enabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension

The feature improves system performance and end-user experience by using both FDD and

TDD spectrum resources.

Operational Process

In the gNodeB SCell selection algorithm, the secondary cells of certain carrier

aggregation capable

UEs

are expanded across two gNodeBs.

The UE connects to the SpCell, then the gNodeB runs the SCell selection

algorithm and checks the following information:

- The carrier aggregation neighbor cell configuration, that is, the SCell candidate and carrier aggregation status for the ESCell
- The UE capability
- The lists of allowed band combinations

If all conditions are met, the CA-capable UE is configured with one downlink

SCell. The selected ESCell is configured and activated according to the same

criteria for an internal SCell as described for the NR DL Carrier Aggregation

feature.

Operational Process for Inter-Baseband Configurations

Figure 2   Operation of Advanced RAN Coordination for NR Carrier Aggregation for

Inter-Baseband Configurations

The coordination of gNodeB-DUs located on different Baseband units consists of the

following steps:

- The gNodeB that hosts the SpCell and the gNodeB that hosts the ESCell are connected through the E5 links over IDLe or TN ports. The Xn interface is used for E5H link setup.
- Configurations used for the E5L link are transmitted from the gNodeB-CUCP to the gNodeB-DU, through the F1 interface.
- Control plane data is transmitted over the E5L link between gNodeB-DUs.
- The UE connects to the SpCell as usual.
- The ESCell is configured and activated according to the same criteria as for a local SCell. User plane data is sent to the ESCell through the E5 tunnel.

Operational Process for Intra-Baseband Configurations

The coordination of FDD and TDD component carriers located on the same Baseband unit

consists of the following steps:

1. Connect the UE to the SpCell
2. Configure and activate the ESCell according the same criteria as for an SCell. The user plane data is sent to the ESCell.

Intra-gNodeB carrier aggregation between FDD and TDD component carriers affects the

maximum number of partner nodes for Advanced RAN Coordination. One partner node is

consumed with intra-gNodeB carrier aggregation between FDD and TDD component

carriers.

## 3.1 Advanced RAN Coordination Partner gNodeB-DUs Modeling for Carrier Aggregation

The SpCell and SCell are hosted on different gNodeB-DUs in different

gNodeBs.

This inter-gNodeB operation uses Advanced RAN Coordination between the gNodeB-DUs

connecting with IDLe or TN ports. This communication link is automatically set up

between Baseband units and is defined as the E5 interface.

This feature uses the ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO class to represent

the external gNodeB-DU. This MO class provides attributes for partner gNodeB

identification and for VLAN port reference to be used in carrier aggregation.

## 3.2 SCell Configuration and Deconfiguration

The Secondary Cell Configuration and Deconfiguration algorithm does not distinguish

between internal or external SCells.

The algorithm is the same as for the internal cells in the NR DL Carrier Aggregation feature.

## 3.3 SCell Activation and Deactivation

If the Data-Aware Carrier Management feature is enabled, the SCell

activation and deactivation is based on the current RLC buffer status and the UE L3

measurements. Otherwise, the SCell activation and deactivation is based on only the UE

L3 measurements.

The UAI overheating mitigation is prioritized over buffer-based and

measurement-based activation and deactivation. If the UAI overheating is mitigated,

in-coverage SCells can be reactivated.

## 3.4 Link Scheduling

The downlink data buffer split algorithm is the same as for the internal cells in the NR

DL Carrier Aggregation feature. Downlink data transmission to a UE on ESCell has the

same data volume and channel quality requirements as an internal SCell.

The new data allocation towards ESCell is based on the following information:

- The downlink data buffer status of the UE
- The estimated ESCell channel conditions
- The ESCell congestion status reported by ESCell

The ESCell receives data over the E5 link and schedules the data. The ESCell allocates

data packets according to the order determined by the SpCell. During

transmission, the ESCell does not split the data packets received from the

SpCell.

The ESCell scheduler discards those downlink data packets that are expired but not

successfully transmitted. The SpCell handles the RLC retransmission for the

discarded packets.

When the SpCell receives the HARQ feedback and the CSI report of the UE in

uplink, the SpCell informs the ESCell.

### 3.4.1 Connected Mode DRX Control

The SpCell and the external SCell for a UE are configured with the same DRX

group. The SpCell and the ESCell control DRX status separately and update

their inactivity timer locally.

When the downlink data transmission is continuous, the UE remains awake and provides

up-to-date downlink channel quality measurements. When there is no ongoing downlink data

transmission to the UE, the UE goes into DRX operation so it does not remain awake.

Under DRX operation, the UE can perform CSI-RS measurements while the

DrxProfileUeCfg.drxOnDurationTimer or the

DrxProfileUeCfg.drxInactivityTimer timer is running. When the UE awakes,

the latest CSI-RS report might not be up-to-date, depending on the sleep time.

# 4 Network Impact of NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension

With this feature, an increase in TDD band coverage and higher end-user throughput

are expected.

Capacity and Performance

The UEs that use external SCells consume a similar amount of resources as the UEs

that use internal cells on the gNodeB.

If an FDD carrier is used as SpCell, the TDD carrier in ESCells has a

downlink coverage gain.

The cell capacity is expected to increase because the downlink data transmission is

faster and more efficient. The downlink throughput is increased by aggregating two

carriers.

For more information, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR

RAN.

For inter-gNodeB Carrier Aggregation or intra-gNodeB-DU inter-capacity module Carrier

Aggregation, because of the different delay paths of each of the component carriers

that are aggregated, the probability of DL RLC PDUs to arrive at the UE out-of-order

is increased. This can result in a higher DL RLC NACK rate.

Interfaces

For inter-Baseband configurations, the interconnect link over IDLe or TN ports must

be set up by higher layers and requires exchange of information between the

different entities. Interconnect link communication between two gNodeBs is achieved

through private extensions to the XnAP and the F1AP interfaces, covering E5-related

signaling.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension

The feature introduces an attribute to be used as a VLAN port reference for carrier

aggregation in inter-Baseband

configurations.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension

## 9.1 VLAN ID for Carrier Aggregation

A default VLAN ID for carrier aggregation in inter-Baseband configurations can be

configured with the GNBDUFunction MO class, which sets the pattern for

separation on feature level.The content of this chapter is applicable only to Inter-Baseband

Configurations.

To support the separation for each E5 link connection, a separate VLAN ID must be

configured for each E5 connection toward different partner gNodeB-DUs. The

ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO has VLAN ID configuration options for

this.

When VLAN ID configuration is defined on both gNodeB-DU level and external gNodeB-DU

partner level, external gNodeB-DU partner level configuration has priority.

VLAN IDs 1, 10, and 770 must not be used as VLAN IDs for NR carrier aggregation traffic

and backhaul traffic because these IDs have specific internal use in the following

units:

- Baseband 6648
- Baseband 6641
- RAN Processor 6651
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347

For more information about VLAN ID configuration for carrier aggregation, see Advanced RAN Coordination.

## 9.2 Carrier Aggregation Partner Relation Status Reporting

The primary gNodeB sets up an E5 tunnel towards a neighbor gNodeB-DU when the following

conditions apply:

- The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL.
- The ExternalNRCellCU.serviceState attribute on the carrier aggregation candidate is set to IN\_SERVICE.

For each carrier aggregation candidate relation that is related to an E5 tunnel, the

NRCellRelation.caStatusActive attribute indicates if this ESCell

can be used for carrier aggregation. This information is used by the SCell selection

algorithm in gNodeB.

The NRCellRelation.caStatusInfo attribute provides additional status

information on the status of carrier aggregation supplementing the

NRCellRelation.caStatusActive attribute.

## 10.2 21.Q4: Enhancement to NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension

This

feature enhancement allows intra-Baseband carrier aggregation for specific RAN Compute units

in FDD and TDD configurations.

| Feature Name:           | NR DL Carrier Aggregation for Coverage Extension   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5202                                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Coverage Extension                        |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables intra-Baseband carrier aggregation for specific

NR-capable RAN Compute units when multiple capacity modules are present for each

gNodeB-DU. The enhancement is available for FDD and TDD configurations.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The NRCellRelation.caStatusActive attribute shows the status of

carrier aggregation in the gNodeB-DU, for each capacity module. This information is

used to determine which internal cell relations can be used for NR carrier

aggregation.

The following characteristic and limitations apply to this feature enhancement:

- The SpCell and SCell are hosted on same Baseband unit but on different capacity modules.
- The SpCell is FDD mode and SCell is in TDD mode.
- Maximum two NR component carriers can be aggregated.
- Component carriers must have different numerologies.
- The maximum number of supported Advanced RAN Coordination partners for each capacity module of the gNodeB-DU is six for each role they take, that is, six as a SpCell and six as an SCell. In case of an intra-gNodeB-DU, the total number of Advanced RAN Coordination partners is the sum of the number of capability modules multiplied by six for each role. If gNodeB-DU contains more than one capacity module, some of the Advanced RAN Coordination partners can be used for internal coordination; for Intra-gNodeB-DU inter-capacity module carrier aggregation, each for every internal capacity module involved.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This enhancement is limited to the following Baseband and Radio Processor units:

- Baseband 6641
- Baseband 6648
- Baseband 6651
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347

Other Network Elements

No impact.
