Summary

The SSB is transmitted in a subset of PRBs. SSB power can be boosted by using the power gained

from muted PDSCH PRBs in

Low-Band

and Mid-Band cells and from unused PRBs in High-Band cells. While

borrowing power from PDSCH PRBs for SSB, the total transmission power of the cell is

maintained as the configured maximum transmission power.

Increased SSB power enables the faster setup and better coverage of SCG radio resources.

In High-Band cells, the feature improves coverage on the cell edge so that the UE can detect

reference signals at a greater distance. In addition, increased SSB transmission

power reduces the received power difference between wide and narrow beams.

This

can potentially improve UE beam refinement depending on UE implementation.

Hardware

All Massive MIMO eCPRI TDD radio units and Remote CPRI TDD radio units are

supported.

The feature is not supported on Massive MIMO FDD radio units, except for AIR 3283 B25

B66 in configurations with up to 35 MHz bandwidth.

The

AIR 3284 supports a maximum of 50 MHz.

Limitations

In High-Band cells, the feature is deployed only to the 50 MHz and 100 MHz

bandwidths.

In

Low-Band cells, the feature is only deployed

on

bandwidths below

35

MHz.

Network Requirements

The feature requires ENM version 21.1 or later to operate.

# 3 Feature Operation of SSB Power Boost

For Low-Band

and Mid-Band cells, the feature requires the configuration of an attribute

to operate. The actual value of power boosting in a

Low-Band or a

Mid-Band cell is indicated by a read-only attribute. In High-Band cells,

the configuration of the related attribute is determined by the supported

bandwidth.

The SSB is transmitted in a subset of PRBs exclusively. In this way, SSB power can be

increased, while the total transmission power of the gNodeB does

not exceed the maximum transmission power.

Operational Process in Low-Band Cells

SSB power boosting can be configured with

the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost

attribute.

Boosting power

value varies

depending on the

the

different supported bandwidths. The used radio configuration

indicates if the maximum power can be reached in a specific supported bandwidth. The

NRCellDU.actualSsbPowerBoost attribute shows the actual value

of power boosting in Low-Band cells.

The AIR3284 B1 B3 B7 supports SSB power boost functionality for up to 50 MHz and 6 dB

is the upper limit for boost value.

The maximum boosting value is 0.79 dB, limited by the

number of PRBs in the cell bandwidth.

(2)

The maximum boosting value is 2.78 dB, limited by the

number of PRBs in the cell bandwidth.

Operational Process in Mid-Band Cells

SSB power boosting can be configured with the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute. Boosting power can reach up

to 4 dB or 6 dB in cells of the different supported bandwidths. The used radio

configuration indicates if the maximum power can be reached in a specific supported

bandwidth. The NRCellDU.actualSsbPowerBoost attribute shows the

actual value of power boosting in Mid-Band cells.

Operational Process in High-Band Cells

In High-Band cells, the feature requires the configuration of the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute, depending on the supported

bandwidth.

When the SSB Power Boost feature is activated together with the Mixed Bandwidth

Support for Carrier Aggregation High Band feature, the following configuration

values must be set:

- For AIR 5121 and AIR 5331, the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute must be set to the same value. This value must be a maximum of 2 dB.
- For Massive MIMO CPRI radio types in the 100 MHz bandwidth, the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute must always be configured 3 dB higher than for the 50 MHz bandwidth.

Increased SSB power allows UEs on the cell edge to attempt random access on both

High-Band and Mid-Band cells. UEs with limitations in other channels might fail the

random access attempt, causing KPI degradation. To prevent UEs on the cell edge from

attempting random access

because

of higher SSB power, the value of the

ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute must be

increased with the same value that is configured for the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute.

For FWA deployments, the value of the

ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute does not have

to be increased, as high power UEs do not have limitations in the uplink

channels.

The increased SSB power is considered during EMF monitoring in the SSB

channel.

# 4 Network Impact of SSB Power Boost

The feature might increase coverage and improve UE performance.

Capacity and Performance

The SSB Power Boost feature might affect throughput due to PDSCH PRB muting. The

feature can also change uplink transmission power due to its impact on uplink power

control.

The feature offers the following benefits in

the

Low-Band and Mid-Band NSA and SA deployments:

- NR cell coverage might increase.
- Boosted SSB power can be configured for each cell and results in higher RSRP measurements.
- The number of random access preambles might increase.

In NSA, the latency of setting up SCG radio resources might be shortened, as

the B1 measurement report might be quicker in case of poor UE coverage.

Boosted SSB power attracts UEs on the cell edge that did not select the cell. As a

result, the lack of enhancement for channeling traffic might degrade

retainability.

In High-Band, the feature improves coverage on the cell edge and increases the

channel analyzing performance of the UE.

Interfaces

For High-Band cells, the following elements are updated in the NR Uu interface:

- SSB power boost is added to the ss-PBCH-BlockPower field. SSB transmit power is indicated to the UE in the ss-PBCH-BlockPower field in the ServingCellConfigCommonSIB IE. The UE uses the ss-PBCH-BlockPower field to compute path loss.
- The value of the powerControlOffsetSS parameter in the RRCReconfiguration message is calculated by the gNodeB based on the values configured for the following attributes: NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost NRCellDU.trsPowerBoosting

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Boosted SSB power can be configured for each cell and results in higher RSRP measurements.
- In NSA, the latency of setting up SCG radio resources can be shortened, as the B1 event measurement report can be quicker in case of poor UE coverage.

Capacity and Performance

Boosting power can reach up to 4 dB or 6 dB in cells of the different supported

bandwidths.

(1)

In order to meet the emission measurement, power boosting

cannot exceed 4 dB when SSB is on the band edge. When

SSB is not on the band edge, power boosting cannot

exceed 6 dB.

This feature enhancement is associated with the gNodeB Contention-Based Robust Random

Access MSG1 Success Rate KPI in the Mid-Band SA deployment.

Operation

The feature enhancement allows SSB power boosting to be configured with the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute in Mid-Band cells. The used

radio configuration indicates if the maximum power can be reached in a specific

supported bandwidth. The NRCellDU.actualSsbPowerBoost attribute

shows the actual value of power boosting in Mid-Band cells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

In Mid-Band cells, the SSB Power Boost feature is supported on all eCPRI sub-band

radio units. In addition, the feature can also be used with the following full-band

AAS radio units:

- AIR 3227
- AIR 3228
- AIR 3236
- AIR 3278
- AIR 6449

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 is required for this feature enhancement.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q2: SSB Power Boost for High-Band Cells

This feature enhancement allows increased SSB power for High-Band cells.

| Feature Name:           | SSB Power Boost             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5239                |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Coverage Extension |

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node         |
| Access Type:            | NR                          |

This feature enhancement enables the support of the SSB Power Boost feature for High-Band

cells. It allows to configure the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute

for 50 MHz and 100 MHz bandwidths.

Benefits

The feature enhancement improves coverage on the cell edge in High-Band cells so that

the UE can detect reference signals at a greater distance. In addition, increased

SSB transmission power reduces the received power difference between wide and narrow

beams. This can improve UE beam refinement in some cases.

Capacity and Performance

Increased SSB power in High-Band cells allows for improved coverage on the cell

edge.

Operation

The SSB Power Boost feature requires the configuration of the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute to a specific value range in

High-Band cells. When the feature is used together with the Mixed Bandwidth Support for Carrier Aggregation

High-Band feature, the following configuration applies:

- For the AIR 5121 and AIR 5331 radio types, the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute must be set to the same value. This value has to be a maximum of 2 dB.
- For CPRI AAS radio types in the 100 MHz bandwidth, the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute must always be configured 3 dB higher than for the 50 MHz bandwidth.

Increased SSB power allows UEs on the cell edge to attempt random access. UEs with

limitations in other channels can fail the random access attempt, causing KPI

degradation. To prevent UEs on the cell edge from attempting random access due to

higher SSB power, the value of the

ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute has to be

increased with the same value configured for the

NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute.

For Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) deployments, the value of the

ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute does not have

to be increased, as high power UEs do not have limitations in the uplink

channels.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement updates the following elements in the NR Uu interface:

- SSB power boost is added to the ss-PBCH-BlockPower field. SSB transmit power is indicated to the UE in the ss-PBCH-BlockPower field in the ServingCellConfigCommonSIB IE. The UE uses the ss-PBCH-BlockPower field to compute path loss.
- The value of the powerControlOffsetSS parameter in the RRCReconfiguration message is calculated by the gNodeB based on the values configured for the following attributes: NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost NRCellDU.trsPowerBoosting

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

This enhancement requires ENM version 21.2 or later to

operate.

## Appendix A.c: 23.Q1: SSB Power Boost on NR Mid-Band CPRI Radios

This feature enhancement supports the SSB Power Boost feature on NR Mid-Band CPRI

radios.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                   |

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases NR cell coverage while keeping the total

transmission power of the gNodeB under the configured maximum transmission power.

The SSB is transmitted only on 20 PRBs and the SSB power can be boosted by borrowing

power from the rest of the PDSCH PRBs without increasing the total transmission

power.

The downlink throughput might be decreased, because more PDSCH PRBs are muted to

boost the SSB.

The following KPIs might be degraded:

- SCG\_ Radio\_Resource Retainability
- DRB Retainability Percentage Lost per mapped 5QI
- DL Init HARQ BLER QPSK per slot
- DL Init HARQ BLER 16QAM per slot

The following KPIs might be increased or degraded depending on the traffic load:

- Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PDSCH slot only
- DL Volume per Cell

For more information, see SSB Power Boost.

Operation

The NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute and the feature license are

checked at the cell unlock, during the cell setup:

- If the feature license is disabled and the value of the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost attribute is not 0, an alarm is raised and the cell setup is rejected.
- If the feature license is disabled and the value of the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost is 0, the SSB Power Boost feature is not activated and the cell setup is not affected.
- If the feature license is enabled and the value of the NRCellDU.ssbPowerBoost is not 0, the SSB Power Boost feature is activated.

The SSB Power Boost feature works on cell level and the maximum boost is 6 dB,

depending on the configuration.

Interfaces

No impact.
