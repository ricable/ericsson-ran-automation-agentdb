Summary

Carrier bandwidths are supported up to 100 MHz. For the list of supported bandwidths

in High-Band, see Manage Radio

Network,

NR

in the Baseband Radio Node library.

The Physical Layer High-Band feature provides

120-kHz

subcarrier spacing for all channels and signals to ensure the

following:

- Robustness to phase noise
- Support for normal UE velocity caused by large Doppler shift on higher frequencies

Physical Layer High-Band supports the following functions:

- The 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern.
- CP-OFDM both in the downlink and in the uplink. It allows for multi-layer uplink transmissions and works well with spectrum fragmentation.
- DFTS-OFDM in the uplink.
- In both uplink and downlink, the following modulation schemes are supported on PDSCH and PUSCH: QPSK 16-QAM 64-QAM In downlink, the maximum supported modulation order on PDSCH is 256-QAM.
- Short PUCCH is used to reduce overhead, as it is not the limiting channel for coverage.

# 3 Feature Operation of Physical Layer High-Band

The feature involves the operation of control and data procedures.

Physical Layer High-Band procedures require the following types of feature-related

elements:

- Physical resources
- Physical signals
- Physical channels

The supported time domain and frame structure enable the functioning of these

feature-related elements.

Time Domain Structure

The Physical Layer High-Band feature supports Time Division Duplex (TDD) with normal

cyclic prefix. The signal in the time domain is structured as shown in Table 2.

Table 2   Time Domain Signal Structure with Normal Cyclic Prefix

| Structure Element   | Length [ms]   | Description            |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Frame               | 10            |                        |
| Subframe            | 1             | 1 frame = 10 subframes |
| Slot                | 1/2Âµ          | 1 subframe = 2Âµ slots  |
| OFDM symbol         | 1/(14 Ã— 2Âµ)   | 1 slot = 14 symbols    |

The High-Band numerology is 2Î¼ Ã— 15 kHz, where Î¼ = 3 (120 kHz subcarrier

spacing).

TDD can use semi-statically configured uplink and downlink. In High-Band, only the 4

downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is supported.

TDD patterns involve special slot configurations. A special slot can contain the

following symbols:

- Downlink
- Uplink
- Guard

The special slot configuration for the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is shown in

Table 3.

Table 3   Special Slot Configuration in High-Band

TDD

for Standard Cell Range

| TDD Pattern                      | Special Slot Configuration   |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 4 downlink + 1 uplink (DDDSU)(1) | 10:2:2 (10 DL: 2 G: 2 UL)    |

(1)

The pattern consist of three downlink, one special

and one uplink slot.

Downlink, uplink and special slots are allocated in the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD

pattern as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   TDD Slot Allocation in High-Band

The allocation of symbols in the supported special slot configurations is shown in

Figure 2.

Figure 2   Supported Special Slot Configuration in High-Band

The 4 downlink + 1 uplink pattern is a regular pattern. It includes the SSB, the TRS,

and random access channel information in downlink and uplink slots. The 4 downlink +

1 uplink pattern supports adaptive length for PDSCH, PUCCH and PDCCH. It provides

enhanced throughput due to reduced beam management overhead.

Figure 3   4 Downlink + 1 Uplink TDD Pattern for Physical Layer High-Band

If the Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature is active and an extended

cell range is configured through the NRCellDU.cellRange

attribute, a longer guard period is needed between downlink and uplink. To support a

longer guard period, more guard symbols and fewer downlink symbols are configured

automatically to match the needed guard period for the configured cell range. For

more information, see Extended Propagation Delay Support

High-Band.

The value of the NRCellDU.ssbDuration attribute can be set

manually. For more information on setting the attribute, see the Engineering

Guidelines section.

## 3.1 Physical Resources

Physical resources concern information related to antenna ports, Resource Elements

and Resource Blocks. Characteristics of the NR cell and bandwidth parts are also

described.

Antenna Port

An antenna port is defined by its associated channel or signal.

The supported set of antenna ports depends on the signal configuration in the

cell.

Resource Element and Resource Block

One OFDM symbol is the smallest time domain unit. A subcarrier is the smallest

frequency domain unit. One OFDM symbol in a single subcarrier is called a Resource

Element.

A Resource Block is defined as 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency

domain.

NR Cell

The NR cell involves the following characteristics:

- Defined by the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) information.
- Supports cell bandwidth up to 100 MHz.

The PCI is for cell identification on the physical layer

and determined by the SSB. The UE uses the PCI to decode physical layer data

transmitted by the gNodeB.

The PCI of an NR cell is configured by using the

NRCellDU.nRPCI attribute.

The PCI must be planned to achieve dual connectivity and

optimal radio network performance. To avoid performance degradation, unique PCIs

must be configured within the same site and as neighbors and neighbors of

neighbors.

For high-band, this is applicable also to different carriers sharing the same radio.

Bandwidth Parts

A single Bandwidth Part (BWP) is defined as equivalent to the cell bandwidth.

A BWP is a contiguous set of resource blocks. It entails the following

characteristics:

- A BWP is associated with a numerology.
- PDCCH, PUCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH and DMRS within a BWP share the same numerology.
- A UE is limited to one active BWP at a time.

## 3.2 Physical Signals

Besides physical resources and physical channels, physical signals are also part of

the Physical Layer High-Band feature.

The downlink physical signals are shown in Table 4.

Table 4   Downlink Physical Signals

| Signal                                         | High-Band   |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Demodulation Reference Signals                 | Supported   |
| Channel State Information Reference Signals(1) | Supported   |
| Phase Tracking Reference Signal                | Supported   |
| Tracking Reference Signals                     | Supported   |
| Primary Synchronization Signals                | Supported   |
| Secondary Synchronization Signals              | Supported   |

(1)

CSI-RS for channel acquisition.

The uplink physical signals are shown in Table 5.

Table 5   Uplink Physical Signals

| Signal                          | High-Band     |
|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Demodulation Reference Signals  | Supported     |
| Phase Tracking Reference Signal | Supported     |
| Sounding Reference Signals(2)   | Not supported |

(2)

The gNodeB does not detect the SRS

sent by the UE in High-Band. However, the SRS is configured

and used for beam management to steer spatial relations in

the uplink.

### 3.2.1 Synchronization Signals

The Synchronization Signal and the PBCH Block constitute the SSB.

Synchronization Signal and PBCH Block (SSB)

The SSB consists of the following signal types:

- Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS)
- Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS)
- PBCH (including DMRS)

The SSB features the following characteristics:

- Uses four consecutive OFDM symbols
- Transmitted every 20 ms
- The numerology of the SSB depends on the frequency band. Conforming to the High-Band numerology, 120 kHz subcarrier spacing is supported.

NR cell search is based on the SSB. It involves the following functions:

- The UE performs matched filtering to find the PSS.
- The UE detects the SSS in the frequency domain. The Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is for cell identification on the physical layer. It is determined by the SSB. There are 3 Ã— 336 = 1008 physical cell IDs in total.

The SSB Power Boost feature can increase the

SSB transmission power in High-Band cells. This increase can have the following

results:

- Coverage can improve on the cell edge, allowing UEs to detect reference signals at a greater distance.
- Received power difference decreases between wide and narrow beams.

### 3.2.2 Tracking Reference Signal

The feature uses TRS for synchronization. This signal type also provides information

related to channel estimation and demodulation.

NR does not use the Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS). The Tracking Reference Signal

(TRS) is introduced for fine synchronization to perform the following:

- Synchronization in time and frequency.
- Providing Doppler and delay spread information required for channel estimation and demodulation.

TRS can also be used for the following functions:

- Radio link monitoring in the UE
- Trigger for beam failure indication

TRS is realized using periodic CSI-RS resources with a period of 20 ms.

### 3.2.3 CSI Reference Signal

In addition to the CSI-RS resources configured for TRS, CSI-RS is also configured for CSI

acquisition.

Related Information

Tracking Reference Signal

### 3.2.4 Sounding Reference Signal

A semi-persistent SRS is configured to define spatial relations for PUCCH, PUSCH, and the

PUSCH codebook.

## 3.3 Physical Channels

The Physical Layer High-Band feature specifies the function and use of control

channels and shared channels.

The following physical channels are specified to carry downlink control information for

NR:

- Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)
- Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)

For downlink data transmission, the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is used.

The following physical channels are specified to carry uplink control information for

NR:

- Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)
- Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)

For uplink data transmission, the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) is used.

### 3.3.1 Downlink Channels

PDCCH carries downlink control information, for example, scheduling assignments.

PDSCH carries the downlink transport block. PBCH carries part of the system information

required by the UE to access the network.

PDCCH

PDCCH carries the Downlink Control Information (DCI), mapped to PDCCH in the first

symbol in every downlink slot. This is realized by the configuration of a common

search space and a UE-specific search space. Both search spaces have a monitoring

periodicity of one slot with the duration of one symbol. The supported aggregation

levels of the PDCCH candidates depend on the cell bandwidth, and can reach up to

eight Control Channel Elements (CCEs).

The Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band

feature can improve random access by boosting the PDCCH transmission power of the

following messages:

- Msg2
- Msg3 retransmission grant
- Msg4 grant
- Initial P2 refinement

PDSCH

PDSCH carries the downlink transport block, supporting up to

256-QAM and two MIMO layers. Resource allocation

is performed in the frequency domain using type 1 resource allocation (start or

length). In the time domain, the resource allocation of PDSCH is done by the DCI in

the same slot, using type A PDSCH mapping. The PDSCH aggregation factor equals one.

This means that a DCI schedules a PDSCH in one slot only.

The Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band

feature can improve random access by boosting the PDSCH transmission power of

Msg2.

### 3.3.2 Uplink Channels

PUCCH carries uplink control information. PUSCH carries the uplink transport block

and uplink control information. PRACH is used for random access and allows the gNodeB to

estimate the delay between itself and the UE.

PUCCH

PUCCH is used for the transmission of downlink HARQ-ACKs and Scheduling Requests.

PUCCH configuration involves the following functions:

- Upon UE connection setup, resource sets for downlink HARQ-ACK are transmitted.
- PUCCH format 0 or 2 are configured.

- One Scheduling Request resource is configured for all uplink bearers.
- PUCCH format 0 and 2 are configured for the SR report.

PUCCH format 2 is configured using up to six allocated PRB pairs, depending on the

number of transmitted Scheduling Requests and HARQ-ACK bits.

PUSCH

PUSCH carries the uplink transport block. It enables up to 64-QAM and two MIMO

layers, using the codebook-based transmission scheme. The CP-OFDM and DFTS-OFDM

waveforms are supported. For resource allocation in the frequency domain, type 1

resource allocation (start/length) is used. In the time domain, the resource

allocation for PUSCH is performed by the DCI at least four slots in advance. Type B

PUSCH mapping is applied. The PUSCH aggregation factor equals one. This means that

the DCI schedules a PUSCH in one slot only.

The characteristics of the single transmission scheme for PUSCH are the following:

- Single or dual TX
- One or two layers
- One-port or two-port DMRS

The Coverage-Optimized Uplink Transmission High-Band feature

supports dynamic waveform switching. Uplink SINR measurements determine the

preferred number of uplink TX ports and the available waveform type. If the measured

uplink SINR deteriorates over a period of time, the NR coverage of the UE becomes

poor. In such cases, the following switching options become possible:

- From the CP-OFDM to the DFTS-OFDM waveform
- From two uplink TX ports to one

Switching to the DFTS-OFDM waveform and one uplink TX port allows the UE the

following operation options:

- Transmission over a single layer
- The use of higher transmission power, as lower power backoff is required

Switching to the CP-OFDM waveform is triggered when the UE is in good NR coverage.

This is achieved if the SINR is above the sum of the SINR threshold and the SINR

hysteresis values. Switching to the CP-OFDM waveform is allowed only after the

uplink prohibit timer expires.

The Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band feature increases the total achieved uplink

throughput in cells that have uplink carrier aggregation configured. It allows the

gNodeB to dynamically adjust the uplink transmission power of the UE, resulting in

the following performance improvements:

- Maximized potential UE uplink throughput.
- Increased uplink carrier aggregation coverage.

For more information, see Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band.

Physical Random Access Channel

The following functions are available on PRACH:

- Eight random access preambles of format A3 or C2 using 120 kHz subcarrier spacing
- One RACH occasion in the uplink slot every 20 ms

Random access preambles are discarded if their timing offset exceeds the derived

timing offset of the configured cell range. The gNodeB discards the strongest power

preamble that is potentially beyond the configured timing offset based on the cell

range. The preamble discard function is based on the

NRCellDU.cellRange attribute.

PRACH preamble format A3 is supported for the following

cell ranges:

- 0-1,100 m
- 6,901-14,000 m

PRACH preamble format C2 is used for cell ranges between

1,101-6,900 m. If the Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature is

activated, PRACH preamble format C2 is supported for cell ranges between 0-1,100 m.

For more information about the configuration of PRACH preamble format C2, see

3GPP TS 38.213.

For more information on the preamble discard function, see Random Access Preamble

Transmission in High-Band in Random Access.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Physical Layer High-Band

The 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern requires changing the default value setting for SSB

duration. The operator has to set the NRCellDU.ssbDuration attribute

in the gNodeB.

The value range of the Beam.ssbPhysicalIndex attribute determines the

physical wide beam index range used by the radio.

Optimal Attribute Values

The NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch values can be changed based on network

conditions and priorities. The optimal values of the attributes depend on the

following conditions:

- The sensitivity of the radio type
- The absolute transmission power accuracy of the UE For more information about how the absolute transmission power accuracy of the UE affects the feature, see 3GPP TS 38.101.

The following settings are recommended for the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch attributes in the PSCell and the

SCell:

- If the priority is to achieve robust performance and the highest possible throughput regardless of radio conditions, the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is recommended to be set to -100 for all radio types. The value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch attribute is recommended to be set to -116 for all radio types.
- If the priority is to minimize the interference, taking different radio types and configurations into account, the values of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch attributes are recommended to be set according to Values for Setting Uplink Power. The interference remains low because of the beamforming of the UE.

Setting the values of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch attributes to 1000

allows the system to auto-select the P0 nominal values for

PUSCH and PUCCH respectively.

The NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucchAutoSelected and the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attributes can be used to

view the P0 value selected by the system in automatic mode.

Rules for Sector Shape

The following rules must apply to the configuration of sector shapes:

- All sector carriers in one sector must have the same sector shape, the same SSB beams value, and the same tilt value.
- Different sectors can be configured with different sector shapes, but the sector shapes must have the same number of SSB beams.

## 8.1 SSB Duration Settings in the gNodeB

The following steps to set SSB duration apply to the gNodeB.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.ssbDuration to 3 ms. Note: In case of configuring 24 wide beams, the NRCellDU.ssbDuration attribute must be set to 4 ms.
2. Delete existing instances of the NRCellRelation, the NRFreqRelation, and the NRFrequency MOs.
3. Create an NRFrequency MO instance with the NRFrequency.smtcDuration attribute set to 3 ms. Note: In case of configuring 24 wide beams, the NRFrequency.smtcDuration attribute must be set to 4 ms.
4. Create and configure NRFreqRelation MO instances to use the new NRFrequency MO instance.
5. Create and configure NRCellRelation MO instances to use the new NRFreqRelation MO instance. For more information on configuring the NRCellRelation, the NRFreqRelation, and the NRFrequency MOs, see Manage Mobility NR.

## 8.2 SSB Duration Settings in the eNodeB

The following steps to set SSB duration apply to the eNodeB.

Steps

1. Delete existing instances of the GUtranCellRelation, the GUtranFreqRelation, and the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency MOs.
2. Create a GUtranSyncSignalFrequency MO instance with the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.smtcDuration attribute set to 3 ms. Note: If the NRCellDU.ssbDuration attribute is set to 4 ms in the gNodeB, the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.smtcDuration attribute must also be set to 4 ms in the eNodeB.
3. Create and configure GUtranFreqRelation MO instances to use the new GUtranSyncSignalFrequency MO instance.
4. Create and configure GUtranCellRelation MO instances under the new GUtranFreqRelations MO instance.

## 8.3 Beam Mapping

Physical wide beams are mapped to the logical wide beam indexes using the

Beam.wideBeamIndex attribute.

A radio unit can have one or more PAAMs. Each PAAM can form a dual-polarized beam that

can be controlled in the time domain. A maximum of four component carriers is allowed

for each PAAM segment. Mixed bandwidth carrier aggregation is allowed with contiguous or

non-contiguous carriers. In a mixed bandwidth configuration, the use of 50 MHz and 100

MHz carriers is allowed. The PAAM configuration for individual beams is determined by

the physical wide beam index. Different radio units require different physical wide beam

indexes.

The Beam.wideBeamIndex attribute is a logical representation of the

wide beam. It is independent of the used radio type. Physical wide beams are mapped to

the logical wide beams using this attribute. The logical wide beam index always begins

from 1 and corresponds to the physical wide beam index up to the number of supported

wide beams.

The 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is used with 12 and 24 SSBs. The maximum number of

Beam MO instances can be 64, as the number of wide beams can

reach up to 64.

The physical wide beam index corresponds to the logical wide beam index in case of the

following radio types and Configuration Modes (CMs):

- AIR 5121
- AIR 5331
- AIR 1281, CM2, single radio
- AIR 5322, CM1, single radio
- Streetmacro 6705, CM1

Figure 4   Beam Mapping for AIR 5121, AIR 5331, Single AIR 1281 CM2, Single AIR 5322

CM1, Streetmacro 6705 CM1

The physical wide beam index differs from the logical wide beam index in case of the

following radio types and CMs:

- AIR 1281, CM1, single radio
- AIR 5322, CM2, single radio
- AIR 5343
- Streetmacro 6705, CM2

Figure 5   Beam Mapping for Single AIR 1281 CM1

Figure 6   Beam Mapping for Single AIR 5322 CM2, Streetmacro 6705 CM2

Indoor AIR 1279 units provide indoor MBB. In a single radio unit deployment, four logical

wide beams are mapped to the four physical wide beams of the Indoor AIR 1279 unit. The

physical wide beam index corresponds to the logical wide beam index.

Figure 7   Beam Mapping for a Single Indoor AIR 1279 Unit

Beside the single radio unit deployment, Baseband units supporting Indoor AIR 1279 also

allow for the fronthaul sharing deployment with two or three radio units.

## 8.5 Monitoring EMF Emission

Counters can be used to observe the transmitted power in downlink to align with EMF

regulatory requirements.

The following counters measure the transmitted power for each sector carrier:

- Beam.pmRadioEirpDlDistr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioPowerDlDistr

The Baseband unit measures the transmitted power for each wide beam during a measurement

step, either transmitted on the wide beam itself or any of the narrow beams within that

wide beam. This is done by summing all downlink resources scheduled during this time. A

sliding window is applied to average the transmitted power over time. As regulations on

radio frequency EMF exposure can limit the averaging time, it is configurable with the

NRSectorCarrier.powerMeasAvgTime attribute.

Figure 9   Sliding Window

The counters are pegged with an updated averaged value at each measurement step. The

Beam.pmRadioEirpDlDistr counter is pegged for each wide beam and

sector carrier. The NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioPowerDlDistr counter is

pegged as the sum of beams within the sector carrier. The counters are reported as

histograms with a percentage of the power relative to the maximum transmission power for

the sector carrier.

To be able to calculate the absolute transmitted power, the maximum value of the

configured transmitted power is measured and reported in each ROP in the

NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioScaledTxPowerMax counter.

The maximum measured EMF power during a ROP can be obtained in the following ways:

- For each beam and sector carrier: Highest Beam.pmRadioEirpDlDistr times NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioScaledTxPowerMax
- For each sector carrier: Highest NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioPowerDlDistr times NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioScaledTxPowerMax
- For multiple sector carriers within a sector: Sum of the highest NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioPowerDlDistr for each sector carrier times NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioScaledTxPowerMax
- For each beam direction, that is, the corresponding beams on each sector carrier: Sum of the highest NRSectorCarrier.Beam.pmRadioEirpDlDistr for each sector carrier within the sector times NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioScaledTxPowerMax

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: Physical Layer High-Band Additional TDD Pattern

The 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is deployed to the Physical Layer High-Band

feature to replace the 3 downlink + 1 uplink pattern.

| Access Type:            | NR                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|

| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                    |
| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required. |

Benefits

The 4 downlink + 1 uplink pattern supports adaptive length for PDCCH, PDSCH and

PUCCH. It provides enhanced throughput due to reduced beam management overhead.

Summary

The 3 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern is no longer supported in High-Band. The

feature supports the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern only. Switching to the use of

the 4 downlink + 1 uplink pattern from the 3 downlink + 1 uplink pattern is

necessary for the feature to operate. The combination of gNodeBs with two different TDD patterns is not supported

with the same anchor eNodeB. For the transition deployment

with two patterns co-existing temporarily, gNodeBs with

different TDD patterns must have sufficient spatial separation. In this way, RF

interference and handover interaction can be avoided.

A special slot configuration is associated with the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD

pattern.

Table 15   Physical Layer High-Band TDD Pattern and Special Slot

Configuration

| TDD Pattern                   | Special Slot Configuration   |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 4 downlink + 1 uplink (DDDSU) | 10:2:2                       |

Capacity and Performance

The use of the 4 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern changes the relation of uplink and

downlink slots as compared to the 3 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern. This affects

KPIs including the number of slots in their formulas. For details on related KPIs,

see the Performance section of Physical Layer High-Band.

Operation

The 4 downlink + 1 uplink pattern is a strict regular pattern enabled by default.

The default value of the NRCellDU.ssbDuration attribute has to be

changed by the operator in the gNodeB. For details regarding

SSB configuration settings in the gNodeB and the eNodeB, see the Engineering Guidelines section of

Physical Layer High-Band.

Due to the difference in the downlink and the uplink ratio, the switch from the 3

downlink + 1 uplink pattern to the 4 downlink + 1 uplink pattern affects the value

of the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmCellDlSlots
- NRCellDU.pmSchedActivityCellDl
- NRCellDU.pmSchedActivityCellUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlAckQpsk
- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqDlAck16Qam

Other Network Elements

The feature requires an EN-DC-capable UE with the latest software update supporting

the 4 downlink + 1 uplink pattern.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q1: Beam Observability in High-Band Cells

This feature enhancement affects the observability of beam management on radio

quality and beam granularity for each physical wide beam.

| Feature Name:           | Physical Layer High-Band   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4903               |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002               |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node        |
| Access Type             | NR                         |

The enhancement introduces PM counters in the NRCellDU MO class for

increased beam observability. The PM counters in the Beam MO

class             are introduced to observe beam granularity.

Benefits

Beam observability PM counters in the NRCellDU MO class support

the better observability of the radio quality. Counters in the

Beam MO class provide beam-level granularity of MCS data.

This MO class represents the information acquired regarding each beam, required for

the following purposes:

- Beam performance management
- Utilization measurement generated in the RAN related to beam transmission
- Beam measurement and beam failure procedures

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following PM counters are introduced for beam observability:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioBeamSwitchSuccMacCe
- NRCellDU.pmRadioBeamSwitchSucc
- NRCellDU.pmRadioNarrowBeamAcqTimeDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioServingBeamDlDistr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPuschDistr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPucchF0Distr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPucchF2Distr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbRsrpDistr

Interfaces

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.1 is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.c: 21.Q1: Random Access Preamble Discard in High-Band Cells

The enhancement introduces the random access preamble discard function for High-Band

cells.

| Feature Name:           | Physical Layer High-Band   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4903               |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002               |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node        |
| Access Type:            | NR                         |

The received timing advance (TA) for the random access preamble can be greater than the

maximum allowed timing offset derived from each configured cell range. In such cases,

the preamble discard function based on the configured cell range ignores random access

preambles.

Benefits

Operators can define the maximum range of the serving cell that is the maximum signal

path distance from the base station. Any preamble received from outside the

configured cell range makes it difficult for the UE to connect and maintain the

connection. As a result, such preambles are discarded. Processing preambles which do

not succeed due to the maximum allowed timing offset based on the configured cell

range result in random access performance degradation. The random access preamble

discard function can eliminate such performance degradation.

Capacity and Performance

As related to this function, the following RACH PM counters are introduced:

- Beam.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1Ooc
- Beam.pmRadioRaAttTaDistr

The preamble discard function can increase the overall RACH msg1 failure rate. The

failure rate resulted by this function is observable with the help of the

Beam.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1Ooc counter.

Operation

Random access preambles are discarded if their timing offset exceeds the derived

timing offset of the configured cell range. The gNodeB

discards the strongest power preamble that is potentially beyond the configured

timing offset based on the cell range. The preamble discard function is based on the

NRCellDU.cellRange attribute.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.1 is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.d: 21.Q3: High-Band EMF Counters Monitoring Solution

transmission. The observed transmitted power is averaged over a configurable

measurement window. This way, operators are able to observe the transmitted power to

be aligned with EMF regulatory requirements.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- Beam.pmRadioEirpDlDistr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioPowerDlDistr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmRadioScaledTxPowerMax

These counters are only pegged when they are defined in the user-specified

scanner.

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRSectorCarrier.powerMeasAvgTime attribute to configure the

measurement window.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Summary and Benefits

This feature

enhancement provides PM counters for observing the

performance

of UEs with limited coverage at cell edge through PM counters.

The PM

counters

enable observability of uplink SINR

performance

on High-Band, including initial access messages.

The

improved observability makes it possible to assess the impact of any High-Band

feature separately for UEs in poor and good uplink

SINR

conditions.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Observability of RACH and PUSCH performance, including uplink SINR.
- Observability of improvements that are achieved through any High-Band feature.
- A possible alternative to performing active drive tests if High-Band features are introduced.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces PM counters to observe the cell coverage during

initial access and connected mode. It is recommended to use the introduced PM

counters to monitor a given feature when it is disabled and when it is enabled. Then

the counter values can be compared for improved

observability.

The following PM counters are introduced to

monitor

cell coverage during initial access:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPreambleSinrMsg3AckDistr
