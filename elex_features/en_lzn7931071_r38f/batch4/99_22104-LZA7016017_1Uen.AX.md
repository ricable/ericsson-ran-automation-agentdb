Hardware

The feature is supported on FR2 TDD Massive MIMO radio units. A radio type that supports

multiple or split PAAM segments is required.

Limitations

No

known

limitations.

Network Requirements

If neighbor nodes are configured with different PSCell frequencies, the network is

recommended to be configured to support inter-frequency handovers.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multiple PSCells High-Band

This feature adds the option to use two PSCells based on the attributes configured

for the cells in the sector, allowing for data transfer in two PSCells in the same

sector.

The feature selects multiple PSCells in a sector based on the number and the capability

of the cells. To use multiple PSCells in a sector, at least two cells must have uplink

capability, and the cells must be on different PAAM segments. The feature selects up to

two cells with uplink capability as PSCell candidates. If only one cell is configured

with uplink capability, only one PSCell is

selected.

The optimal operation of the feature can be ensured with the configuration of PSCell

candidates on the highest and lowest frequencies in the sector. This maximizes the

probability that PSCells are assigned to different PAAM segments. If PSCell candidates

are not configured on the highest and lowest frequencies in the sector, it is possible

that the PSCell candidates are assigned to the same PAAM segment. In this case,

the

feature is disabled.

Configuration in the Secondary Cell Group

The PSCells must have uplink capability and must be configured for different PAAM

segments of the sector.

Uplink capability is configured by setting the value of the

NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute to

DL\_AND\_UL. The NRCellCU.pSCellCapable

read-only attribute indicates whether the cell is

PSCell-capable.

For more information on the configuration of sector carriers in a multiple PSCell

setup, see Manage Radio Network.

Configuration in the Master Cell Group in EN-DC

In the MCG, the following configuration is required for the

EUtranCellFDD or the EUtranCellTDD MO

instances that cover the sector with multiple PSCells:

- The GUtranCellRelation MO must be configured for every PSCell candidate to represent the relationship between the E-UTRAN cell and the PSCell candidate.
- The GUtranFreqRelation.endcB1MeasPriority attribute must be set to the same value for each PSCell candidate to ensure that traffic is evenly distributed between the PSCells.

To configure only one PSCell in the SCG, the GUtranFreqRelation MO

must not be configured in the MCG for the second PSCell. The lack of configured

GUtranFreqRelation MO ensures that the second PSCell is not

included in the B1 measurement object list and the UE does not attempt to connect to

the cell.

For more details on the Master Cell Group configuration in EN-DC, see Basic Intelligent Connectivity

Configuration in the Master Cell Group in NR-DC

In the MCG, the following configuration is required for the

ExternalNRCellCU MO instances that cover the sector with

multiple PSCells:

- The NRCellRelation MO must be configured for each PSCell candidate to represent the relationship between the NR cell and the PSCell candidate.
- The NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4 must be set to the same value as the number of PSCell candidates. Setting the corresponding value for the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4 attribute ensures that all PSCells are included in the A4 measurement object list and the UE can attempt to connect to any one of the cells.

For more information on the Master Cell Group configuration in NR-DC, see NR-NR Dual Connectivity.

Operational Process

1. The Secondary Node selects uplink-capable carriers with the lowest and the highest frequencies as PSCell candidates.
2. The Master Node configures the list of frequencies based on the following criteria: For EN-DC, the configuration is based on the configured cell relations and priority levels. For NR-DC, the configuration is based on the following: The configured frequency and cell relations The nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4 parameter that defines the maximum number of measurement objects.
3. The list is sent to the UE.
4. The UE performs measurements on the configured frequencies to find the candidate PSCells.
5. The Master Node randomly assigns UEs to the two PSCells.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Multiple PSCells High-Band

The optimal configuration for this feature is a sector with at least four cells,

where the cells are configured for at least two PAAM segments.

Related concepts

Feature Operation of Multiple PSCells High-Band

## 8.1 Intra-frequency Mobility between PSCells

The NR PSCell mobility relies on intra-frequency mobility as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This means that the PSCell for a UE is

kept on the same PSCell frequency at mobility. Additionally, the load distribution

between the two PSCell frequencies, done during EN-DC establishment, is preserved.

Figure 1   Intra-frequency Mobility for 4CC

Figure 2   Intra-frequency Mobility for 8CC

For more information, see NR

Mobility and NR-NR Dual Connectivity.

## 8.2 Intra-frequency Mobility between 4CC and 8CC

Figure 3   Intra-frequency Mobility between 4CC and 8CC

In Figure 3, intra-frequency mobility is

possible between the PSCell1 of Secondary Node 1 and the PSCell1 of Secondary Node 2 if

the High-Band frequency for the cells is the same.

For PSCell4, there is no corresponding PSCell on the same High-Band frequency in the 8CC

configuration. From a mobility perspective, there is no need for cell relations between

PSCell4 and SCell4. If such cell relations exist, for example, added by the NR Automatic

Neighbor Relations feature, it is important that the

NRCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to

false to avoid triggering handover toward the SCell4.

If the UE reports the SCell4 as an intra-frequency PSCell candidate, the evaluation of

this PSCell candidate can fail. This can be caused by a missing cell relation or that

the NRCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to

false for the reported cell.

In EN-DC configurations, depending on the

IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.endcActionEvalFail attribute, the

Secondary Node can ignore the report or trigger the Secondary Node release. In this

case, it is recommended to configure the Secondary Node to ignore the report and instead

rely on inter-frequency mobility.

For more information, see NR Mobility and NR-NR Dual Connectivity.

## 8.3 Inter-frequency Mobility between 4CC and 8CC

Inter-frequency mobility is provided through the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

function of the NR Mobility feature. Inter-frequency mobility is only supported for

EN-DC.

Figure 4   Inter-frequency Mobility between 4CC and 8CC

In Figure 4, inter-frequency mobility is

only needed between PSCell8 on Secondary Node 1 and PSCell4 on Secondary Node 2.

In the direction from PSCell4 to PSCell8, there are no issues because the Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage function can be used with no special considerations. However,

in the direction from PSCell8 to PSCell4, the frequency is the same in PSCell4 and

SCell4, which is the serving cell, and this might have the following consequences:

- The UE requires a measurement gap in order to measure on the PSCell4 frequency, even if the frequency is used and a serving cell (SCell4) exists.
- The UE reports its own SCell4 cell instead of the PSCell4, and that a handover is initiated toward SCell4. To avoid this, it is recommended to define a cell relation between PSCell8 and SCell4 with the NRCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute set to false.Note: It is also possible to reduce the risk of this unwanted handover by setting the A5 threshold2 to a value that is 3 dB higher than the A2 threshold for MCPC.

For more information, see NR Mobility and NR-NR Dual Connectivity.

## 8.4 Configuring Multiple PAAM Segments for AIR 1281

For

radios with virtual PAAM segments, the use of two PAAM segments can be

enforced by setting the AasData.antSegmentation attribute to

SPLIT\_H\_50\_50.

For radios with virtual PAAM segments, the default antenna segmentation in the

AasData.antSegmentation attribute is set to

AUTO. The node determines the antenna segmentation based on the

aggregated NR sector carriers associated with the radio unit. As a result, it is

possible that the node automatically chooses to use an antenna segmentation with one

PAAM segment. To enforce the use of two PAAM segments, it is recommended to set the

AasData.antSegmentation attribute to

SPLIT\_H\_50\_50.

## 8.5 Optimal Configuration with Two Component Carrier Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The optimal configuration of the feature has the following characteristics:

- The sector is configured with at least four uplink-capable cells, and maximum two of these cells use the same PAAM segment. To optimize carrier aggregation in this configuration, the PSCells must share the PAAM segment with their associated uplink SCell.

Example 1 shows the optimal configuration for

the feature.

Example 1   Configuration with Two PAAM Segments and Eight

Cells

Figure 5   Distribution of Two PAAM Segments and Eight Cells

The requirements of the optimal configuration are fulfilled by the following

characteristics:

- At least four cells are uplink-capable.
- The PSCell candidates are configured for different PAAM segments.

The feature selects the uplink-capable sector carriers with the lowest

and the highest frequencies as PSCells. As a result, the following cells are PSCell

candidates:

- F1, as it has the lowest frequency.
- F8, as it has the highest frequency.

Since these cells use different PAAM segments, F1 and F8 are selected as

PSCells.

The requirements of the optimal configuration are also fulfilled by

the following configuration details:

- There are eight cells in the sector.
- The cells on the lowest and highest frequencies are uplink-capable.
- The uplink-capable cells are configured in adjacent cell pairs of each PAAM segment.

The uplink-capable cells adjacent to the PSCells can be scheduled as

SCells. Accordingly, the following applies to this example:

- F2 is the adjacent uplink-capable cell to the F1 cell.
- F7 is the adjacent uplink-capable cell to the F8 cell.

It is possible to schedule SCells for both PSCells for the following

reasons:

- The F2 cell shares the same PAAM segment with the F1 cell.
- The F7 cell shares the same PAAM segment with the F8 cell.

## 8.6 Optimal Configuration for a Single-Sector Setup with Four Component Carrier Uplink Carrier Aggregation

In the optimal configuration of the feature, the sector is configured with eight

uplink-capable cells, and maximum four of these cells use the same PAAM segment. To

enable carrier aggregation in this configuration, the PSCells share the PAAM segment

with their associated uplink SCells.

Example 2 shows the optimal configuration for

the feature.

Example 2   Configuration with Two PAAM Segments and Eight

Uplink-Capable Cells

Figure 6   Distribution of Two PAAM Segments and Eight Uplink-Capable Cells

The requirements of the optimal configuration are fulfilled by the following

characteristics:

- Eight cells are uplink-capable.
- The PSCell candidates are configured for different PAAM segments.

The feature selects the uplink-capable sector carriers with the lowest

and the highest frequencies as PSCells. As a result, the following cells are PSCell

candidates:

- F1, as it has the lowest frequency.
- F8, as it has the highest frequency.

Since these cells use different PAAM segments, F1 and F8 are selected as

PSCells. The requirements of the optimal configuration are also fulfilled by the

following configuration details:

- The sector has eight cells.
- The cells on the lowest and highest frequencies are uplink-capable.
- The uplink-capable cells are configured in adjacent cell pairs of each PAAM segment.

The uplink-capable cells adjacent to the PSCells can be scheduled as

SCells. Accordingly, the following applies to this example:

- F2, F3, and F4 are the adjacent uplink-capable cells to the F1 cell.
- F7, F6, and F5 are the adjacent uplink-capable cells to the F8 cell.

It is possible to schedule SCells for both PSCells for the following

reasons:

- The F2, F3， and F4 cells share the same PAAM segment with the F1 cell.
- The F7, F6， and F5 cells share the same PAAM segment with the F8 cell.

## 8.7 Optimal Configuration with 4 CC Uplink Carrier Aggregation

In the optimal configuration of the feature, the sectors are configured with four

uplink-capable cells each, and maximum two of these cells use the same PAAM segment.

Example 3 shows the optimal configuration for

the feature.

Example 3   Configuration with Two PAAM Segments and Eight

Cells with Four Uplink-Capable Cells

Figure 7   Distribution of Two PAAM Segments and Eight Cells with Four Uplink-Capable

Cells

The requirements of the optimal configuration are fulfilled by the following

characteristics:

- Four cells are uplink-capable per sector.
- The PSCell candidates are configured for different PAAM segments.

The feature selects the uplink-capable sector carriers with the lowest

and the highest frequencies as PSCells. As a result, the following cells are PSCell

candidates:

- F3, as it has the lowest frequency.
- F6, as it has the highest frequency.

Since these cells use different PAAM segments, F3 and F6 are selected as

PSCells. The requirements of the optimal configuration are also fulfilled by the

following configuration details:

- There are eight cells in the sector.
- The cells on the lowest and highest frequencies are uplink-capable.
- The uplink-capable cells are configured in adjacent cell pairs of each PAAM segment and adjacent cell pairs between PAAM segments.

The uplink-capable cells adjacent to the PSCells can be scheduled as

SCells. Accordingly, the following applies to this example:

- F4, F5, and F6 are the adjacent uplink-capable cells to the F3 cell.
- F5, F4, and F3 are the adjacent uplink-capable cells to the F6 cell.

It is possible to schedule one SCell for both PSCells for the following

reasons:

- The F4 cell shares the same PAAM segment with the F3 cell.
- The F5 cell shares the same PAAM segment with the F6 cell.

## 8.8 Optimal Configuration with 4 CC Downlink Carrier Aggregation and 2 CC Uplink Carrier Aggregation

In the optimal configuration of the feature, if the sectors are configured with four

downlink-capable and two uplink-capable cells each, then no more than two cells are

allowed to use the same PAAM segment.

Example 4   Configuration of Two PAAM Segments and Four Cells

with Two Uplink-Capable Cells

Figure 8   Distribution of Two PAAM Segments and Four Cells with Two Uplink-Capable

Cells

The requirements of the optimal configuration are fulfilled by the following

characteristics:

- There are four cells, two of which are capable of uplink data transfer.
- The PSCell candidates are configured for different PAAM segments.

The feature selects the uplink-capable sector carriers with the lowest

and the highest frequencies as PSCells. As a result, the following cells are PSCell

candidates:

- The F2 cell, as it has the lowest frequency.
- The F3 cell, as it has the highest frequency.

Since these cells use different PAAM segments, F2 and F3 are selected as

PSCells. The requirements of the optimal configuration are also fulfilled by the

following configuration details:

- There are four cells in the sector.
- The F2 and F3 cells are uplink-capable.

The uplink-capable cells adjacent to the PSCells can be scheduled as

SCells. Accordingly, the following applies to this example:

- The F2 is the adjacent uplink-capable cell to the F3 cell.
- The F3 is the adjacent uplink-capable cell to the F2 cell.

## 8.9 Configuration for Multiple FR2 Frequencies in A4 Measurement

Multiple FR2 frequencies can be included in the A4 measurement if the Master Node is

configured with the required cell and frequency relations.

If more than one FR2 frequency fulfills the criteria to be included in A4 measurement,

all FR2 frequencies up to the value of the

NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcMaxMeasFreqA4 attribute are selected

as candidates, while maintaining the order of PSCell candidates in the randomized

list.

For this feature to be able to utilize all PSCell candidates, the Master Node must be

configured to secure the relation between the PCell and the PSCell candidates.

# 9 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 9.1 21.Q4: Three-Sector Support for Multiple PSCells High-Band

The

feature enhancement introduces support for multiple PSCells in up to three

sectors.

| Feature Name:           | Multiple PSCells High-Band   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5341                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | NR                           |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, up to three sectors can be configured with two PSCells

each. This means that the feature supports the use of six PSCells in total. If

multiple PSCells are configured in all sectors, all UEs in the coverage area can

benefit from the decreased latency associated with multiple PScells.

Capacity and Performance

In a three-sector configuration, a single sector can have up to 200 connected users

with a maximum of 300 connected users in total in the three sectors.

Operation

The enhancement provides the option to deactivate the feature through MCG

configuration. To configure only one PSCell in the SCG, the

GUtranFreqRelation MO must not be configured in the MCG for

the second PSCell. This ensures that the second PSCell is not included in the B1

measurement object list and the UE does not attempt to connect to it.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

To maintain high performance, this enhancement is supported on the following hardware

units:

- Baseband 6641
- Baseband 6648
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347

Other Network Elements

## 9.2 22.Q1: Multiple PSCells per Sector (FR2) - 3x200 CU Enabler with Multiple PSCells

This feature enhancement allows a maximum of 600 connected users in a three-sector

setup with multiple PSCells.

| Feature Name:           | Multiple PSCells High-Band   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5341                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package              |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | NR                           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement increases the maximum number of connected users to 600 over

three sectors configured with multiple PSCells. As the maximum number of connected

users for each PSCell is 100, the maximum number of 600 connected users is achieved

with the use of six PSCells in the gNodeB-DU.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement affects network capacity and performance in the following

ways:

- The maximum number of connected users for a gNodeB-DU is increased.
- A maximum of four uplink sector carriers can be configured in a sector and the use of two component carriers for each PSCell is supported for uplink carrier aggregation in a configuration with multiple sectors.

Operation

600 connected users in three sectors can be achieved by enabling multiple PSCells in

each sector.

Interfaces
