# 1 NR Key Performance and Resource Use Indicators Overview

The NR Key Performance and Resource Use Indicators feature provides network

performance observability for the gNodeB.

| Feature Name           | NR Key Performance and Resource Use Indicators          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5039                                            |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                                            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type            | NR                                                      |
| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature. No license is required. |

Summary

KPIs and RIs measure the performance and quality of a RAN. Operation and Maintenance

personnel, network engineers, and management use these observability indicators to

perform important tasks, such as:

- Supervising and optimizing radio network performance to provide better subscriber-perceived quality, or better use of installed resources.
- Rapidly detecting unacceptable performance in the network. They enable the operator to take immediate actions to preserve the quality of the network.
- Providing radio network planners with the information on traffic levels and resource use. These indicators are required for dimensioning and configuration of optimal network use.
- Troubleshooting on cell clusters of interest.

For more details about the areas of network observability, see Key Performance Indicators and License and Resource Use Indicators.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Key Performance and Resource Use Indicators

The feature has no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitation

No limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Operation of NR Key Performance and Resource Use Indicators

KPIs represent the end-user perception of a network on a macro level. Operators use KPI

statistics to compare networks against each other, and to detect problems and errors.

KPIs are calculated from Performance Indicators and Performance Management (PM) counters. The reliability,

granularity, and accuracy of the data are critical, and the data is collected

continuously.

License and Resource Use Indicators represent information at the system level that explains the system

capacity and resource use. The RI data can be used for planning and dimensioning. This

data, typically PM counters, is collected continuously (or on demand).

For more information about KPIs and RIs, see Key Performance Indicators and License and Resource Use Indicators.

Events

No new events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
