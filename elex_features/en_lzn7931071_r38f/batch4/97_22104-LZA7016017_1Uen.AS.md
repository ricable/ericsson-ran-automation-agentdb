Summary

With the Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band feature, the gNodeB can instruct the UE

to adjust the uplink power on the PSCell and SCells. The following cases are

possible:

- In non-power limited situations, the gNodeB adjusts the power based on the received PSD target.
- In power limited situations, the gNodeB adjusts the power based on the power headroom target.

With this feature, the uplink transmission power of the UE can be dynamically

adjusted for changing channel conditions through the P0 value.

This provides maximized potential UE uplink throughput and increased uplink carrier

aggregation coverage. The P0 value can be configured to be

automatically selected based on the receiver sensitivity of the radio.

The UE-specific power control mode can be configured with a MOM attribute to be

either open-loop power control or close-loop power control.

# 3 Feature Operation of Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band

The feature provides dynamic transmission power control to maximize the uplink

throughput and the use of uplink carrier aggregation.

For uplink, closed-loop power control is used with Transmit Power Control (TPC)

accumulation, according to 3GPP 38.213. This means that the gNodeB

dynamically adjusts the UE transmission power on the PSCell, and in case of uplink

carrier aggregation also on the SCell. The

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute defines the

P0 value, the initial uplink transmission power of every

connected UE.

The system can be configured to auto-select the P0 nominal values,

for PUSCH and PUCCH respectively, by setting the values of the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch attributes to 1000.

The NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucchAutoSelected and the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attributes can be used to view

the P0 value selected by the system in automatic mode.

The UE power control mode can be configured to be open-loop power control mode or

closed-loop power control mode with the

PowerControlUeCfg.puschPowerControlModeFr2 attribute.

Figure 1 shows a theoretical throughput gain with

the feature operational that is compared to the throughput using NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature without

closed-loop power control with different NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant

attribute configurations.

Figure 1   Throughput with Closed-Loop Power Control in Uplink

The feature uses a received PSD-based closed-loop power control algorithm on the PSCell

for UEs in non-power limited situations. If the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature is activated

and used, the algorithm is used on both the PSCell and the SCells. The target received

PSD is not configurable. It is set by the system depending on the used radio unit to a

level that aims to maintain peak uplink throughput.

When the target received PSD is no longer maintainable, the UE is in a power-limited

situation. In such cases, the feature uses the power headroom target value on the

PSCell. The target value depends on the number of SCells and their bandwidth. The

feature adjusts the transmission power of the PSCell to reach a power headroom target

that allows the UE to allocate enough power to transmit to the SCells.

The gNodeB performs the following adjustment steps to control the UE power:

- -1 dB
- 0 dB
- +1 dB

Power Balancing Principles

If the UE has a significant power headroom, the transmission power towards the PSCell

is increased to achieve a higher peak throughput, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Power Balancing in Closed-Loop Power Control When Power Headroom is

Significant

If the power headroom of the UE is below zero, the power balancing has the following

effect, as shown in Figure 3:

- The transmission power of the UE towards the PSCell is lowered.
- The UE can allocate power to the SCells.

This increases the throughput by achieving better carrier aggregation

coverage.

Aggregation is Insufficient

# 4 Network Impact of Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band

The feature enhances the performance of uplink carrier aggregation.

Capacity and Performance

If the NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band feature is activated, the Closed-Loop

Power Control High-Band feature allows for higher user throughput in uplink, with

increased uplink carrier aggregation coverage.

The UE might skip the SCells and carriers scheduled by the gNodeB for uplink carrier

aggregation, for example because of capacity limitations. The gNodeB scheduler

detects this when checking the related power headroom reports and adapts the

following processes to the reduced UE capabilities:

- Uplink carrier aggregation scheduling
- Uplink CLPC

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band

This feature affects the counter indicating the distribution of uplink power headroom

reported by UEs.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following counters can be used to observe the performance of the feature:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschPhrDistr The reported distribution of power headroom changes based on the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute. The amount of change depends on previous NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant settings and the amount of traffic-heavy applications in the uplink. If the previous values of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute are lower, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschPhrDistr counter also has a lower value after the feature is activated.
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschPwrSpectralDensityDistr

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces a function with which the Closed-Loop Power

Control High-Band feature can perform power control in

single-carrier

demand mode when the Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature

deactivates the SCells.

The

feature enhancement prevents unnecessary PHR reservation for

deactivated SCells, which allows a higher power usage on the PSCell.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement allows UEs to have a higher power usage on the PSCell.

Counters related to the following KPIs are increased:

- SINR
- MCS
- PSCell throughput

Counters related to the following KPIs are decreased:

- PHR
- UL BLER

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Description of Correction

The setting of the power headroom target is corrected when changing from

multi-carrier demand to single-carrier demand if the uplink carrier aggregation is

no longer used. As a consequence, the threshold for re-entry to multi-carrier demand

is decreased leading to easier re-entry. This can result in increased use of uplink

carrier aggregation and higher SCell utilization.
