beamforming on mmW bands.

Summary

The Massive MIMO High-band feature uses the 28-GHz and 39-GHz mmW bands, and supports

analog beamforming with single-user MIMO. The following functions are supported:

- Horizontal and vertical beamforming
- Up to two layers in uplink and downlink
- Beam management to find and dynamically maintain the beam pair between the UE and the gNodeB

# 2 Dependencies of Massive MIMO High-Band

The Massive MIMO High-Band feature supports the PRODUCT\_DEFAULT coverage

shape.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

The feature is supported on all Baseband units and radio units supporting NR.

For the list of baseband units and radio units supporting NR, see the following

documentation:

- Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN
- Radio Node Configurations

Limitations

Only the PRODUCT\_DEFAULT coverage shape is supported.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Massive MIMO High-Band

The Massive MIMO High-Band feature supports beam management to find and maintain the

beam pair between the UE and the gNodeB.

The coverage shape supported for the sector is PRODUCT\_DEFAULT.

Coarse analog beamforming is used to transmit the following channels and signals in

downlink:

- PSS
- SSS
- PBCH
- TRS
- CSI-RS
- PDCCH
- PDSCH
- The associated DMRSs and PTRSs

In downlink, beam management is based on the following processes:

- P1: Initial gNodeB TX beam sweep and UE beam acquisition
- P2:gNodeB beam refinement and tracking
- P3: UE RX beam sweep for refinement

In P1, beam sweeping SSBs are used to establish a coarse beam during initial access. The

UE can measure on SSBs and acquire a suitable downlink beam. The beam selection is made

known to the gNodeB by the selected RACH resources.

In P2, the gNodeB schedules aperiodic CSI-RS and aperiodic CSI or

SSB measurement reports, which are used to select gNodeB

beams.

In P3, the UE autonomously updates its beam, with no feedback required. The process can

be performed by the UE based on SSB DMRS with or without TRS and is transparent to gNodeB.

In uplink, beam management is based on beam correspondence, therefore no specific

procedure is required in addition to downlink beam management.

Coarse analog beamforming is used to receive the following channels and signals in

uplink:

- PRACH
- PUCCH
- PUSCH
- The associated DMRSs and PTRSs

# 6 Performance of Massive MIMO High-Band

The Massive MIMO High-Band feature does not affect associated KPIs, counters or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

The feature is related to the

following counters:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioBeamSwitchSuccMacCe
- NRCellDU.pmRadioBeamSwitchSucc
- NRCellDU.pmRadioNarrowBeamAcqTimeDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioServingBeamDlDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioSsbBeamSwitch
- Beam.pmRadioSsbRsrpDistr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPuschDistr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPucchF0Distr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPucchF2Distr

The

NRCellDU.pmRadioServingBeamDlDistr counter can be used to

monitor

SBB

beam utilization and

to

check beam utilization. If beam utilization is low,

the

tilt or direction of the radio unit can be changed.

Physical Layer High-Band.
