Summary

This feature improves the accessibility to a highly loaded system for emergency

calls. In this case, high load means that the number of connected UEs for each

affected Sector Carrier or Baseband Radio Node is about to reach the maximum

capacity of the system.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Emergency Call Prioritization

The feature can be used to provide higher accessibility to emergency calls in

scenarios where the maximum number of connected UEs for a Baseband Radio Node or a Sector

Carrier is about to be reached.

NR Emergency Call Prioritization is enabled by Priority-Based Admission Control. Priority

for UEs that send an RRCSetupRequest message with the establishment cause

emergency can be configured separately using the

AdmissionControl.rrcEmergencyPrio attribute. Emergency calls are

only prioritized if the AdmissionControl.rrcEmergencyPrio attribute

is set to a value lower than the value of the

AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold attribute.

For more information on the feature operation, see Priority-Based Admission Control.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Emergency Call Prioritization

The feature has impact on accessibility KPIs.

Capacity and Performance

The feature provides improved accessibility for emergency calls.

The accessibility KPIs for non-emergency calls might be degraded as the limit of the

available affected resources accessible to non-emergency calls is lowered to create

the resource pool accessible only to emergency calls. For the same reason,

accessibility KPIs for emergency calls can improve.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of NR Emergency Call Prioritization

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines

## 8.1 Configure RRC Connection Emergency Prioritization

Emergency call requests are prioritized by setting the value of the corresponding MO

attribute. RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default.

Steps

1. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute to 2.
2. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcEmergencyPrio MO attribute to a value that is lower than or equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute. Note: Because of this, in Example1, the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcEmergencyPrio MO attribute is set to 2.

RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default as the value of the

AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio attribute is set

to 1 by default. To remove the default prioritization of RRC

Re-establishment requests, do the following:

3. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio MO attribute to a value that is higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute.

Example 1   Configure RRC Connection Emergency Prioritization and RRC Re-establishment

Prioritization

```
ManagedElement=1,GNBDUFunction=1,AdmissionControl=1
admissionPrioThreshold 2
rrcEmergencyPrio 2
rrcReestablishmentPrio 1
```

## 8.2 Configure Emergency Call Prioritization, Voice Call Prioritization, and RRC Connection Re-establishment

Emergency calls, and voice calls can be prioritized by configuring the corresponding

MO attributes. RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default.

Steps

1. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute to 3.
2. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcEmergencyPrio MO attribute to 2.
3. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcMoVoiceCallPrio MO attribute to 3.

RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default as the value of the

AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio attribute is set

to 1 by default. To remove the default prioritization of RRC

Connection Re-establishment, do the following:

4. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio MO attribute to a value that is higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute.

Example 2   Configure Emergency Call Prioritization, Voice Call Prioritization, and RRC

Connection Re-establishment

```
ManagedElement=1,GNBDUFunction=1,AdmissionControl=1
admissionPrioThreshold 3
rrcEmergencyPrio 2
rrcMoVoiceCallPrio 3
rrcReestablishmentPrio 1
```
