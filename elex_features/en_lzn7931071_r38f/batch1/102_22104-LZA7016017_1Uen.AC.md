Summary

The NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support feature enables the UE to set up and

maintain emergency voice calls over NR in limited service mode. The UE is in limited

service mode when, for example, it is outside of home PLMN coverage or no SIM card

is inserted.

The feature also supports the mobility of UEs in limited service mode during emergency voice

call.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

There are no known limitations.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, ENM version 21.3 or later is

recommended.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

The NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support feature allows UEs in limited service

mode to set up an emergency voice call over NR.

The NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support feature enables the UE to set up and

maintain emergency voice calls over NR in limited service mode. The UE is in limited

service mode if it is outside of home PLMN coverage or no SIM card is inserted.

The feature is enabled on cell level by setting the

NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled attribute to true.

The change in the NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled attribute takes effect

at the next SIB1 transmission.

Operational Process

1. The ims-EmergencySupport indicator is broadcasted in SIB1 messages in every cell where the feature is enabled. Note: 5GC must support limited service mode to set this indicator in NR RAN.
2. The UE in limited service mode performs a cell selection or reselection to find and select a cell that supports emergency calls in limited service mode.
3. The UE camps on the selected cell.

As a result, the UE can establish emergency calls in limited service mode. For more

information on emergency call handling, see NR Emergency Procedures.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

The feature has an impact on the capacity of the network by granting access to

emergency calls in limited service mode.

Capacity and Performance

There is a minor impact on network capacity as UEs in limited service mode are

allowed to make emergency

calls

in this network.

Interfaces

The feature updates the following RRC protocol messages in the NR Uu interface:

- RRC RECONFIGURATION
- SIB1

Other Network Elements

The UE and the 5GC must support limited service mode.

# 5 Parameters for NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

The feature introduces the NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled MOM

attribute for configuration.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                    | Type       | Description          |
|------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

The feature introduces two EBS counters and affects three events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following EBS counters are introduced:

- pmEbsDrbEstabAttLsm5qi
- pmEbsDrbEstabSuccLsm5qi

Events

Table 3   Modified Events

| Event                            | Event Parameter      | Description                                              |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| CuCpProcInitialCtxtEstab         | limited_service_mode | Event for monitoring Initial Context Setup procedure.    |
| CuCpProcPduSessionResourceSetup  | limited_service_mode | Event for monitoring PDU Session Setup procedure.        |
| CuCpProcPduSessionResourceModify | limited_service_mode | Event for monitoring PDU Session Modification procedure. |

# 7 Activate NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012538 MO instance.
2. Set the NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled attribute to true. Note: The change in the NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled attribute takes effect at the next SIB1 transmission.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled attribute to false. Note: If the attribute is set to true while the feature is deactivated, the cell will be disabled after the node is restarted or the cell is unlocked.
2. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012538 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q3: Enhanced Feature Activation Configuration of NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support

With the feature enhancement, configuration of the emergency call support in the

network takes effect at the next SIB1 transmission.

| Feature Name           | NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5302                                     |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                              |
| Access Type            | NR                                               |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                                        |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the activation of emergency call support without

locking and unlocking the cell.

Capacity and Performance

Downtime due to configuration change is decreased.

Operation

The change in the configuration of the

NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled attribute takes place at the

next SIB1 transmission instead of the cell unlock. This means that the cell does not

need to be locked and unlocked during the feature activation for the configuration

to take effect.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Summary and Benefits

This

enhancement has the following benefits:

- When security information is received in the NGAP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, an intra-cell handover is triggered according to the 3GPP standard. Security information is synchronized with the UE, and the UE is kept in connected state instead of UE release. The same applies to UEs in limited service mode, lifting a previous restriction in the NR Limited Service Mode Emergency Call Support feature.
- NG and Xn handovers for emergency call are prioritized in overload protection algorithms.

The default list for the SecurityHandling.cipheringAlgoPrio

attribute is changed from NEA2,NEA1,NEA0 to NEA2,NEA1.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This enhancement provides updates on the following PM Events:

- CuCpProcNrHoIcPrep
- CuCpProcNrHoIcExe
- CuCpProcUeCtxtMod
- CuCpIncomingHandoverFailure

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 23.1 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
