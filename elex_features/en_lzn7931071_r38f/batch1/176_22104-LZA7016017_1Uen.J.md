Hardware

No

specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The conditions for Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are not evaluated during the

PDU Session Resource Modify procedure. The evaluation is started at the next

mobility action.

Network Requirements

ENM version 23.09 or later is required for this

feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Dynamic QoS Modification

The dynamic modification of the QoS parameters of an already established QoS flow and

DRB provides increased flexibility when changing the characteristics of the service provided

for individual UEs.

The NR Dynamic QoS Modification feature allows the modification of the QoS properties of

an established QoS flow. The modification of 5QI and Allocation and Retention Priority

(ARP)

values are supported. The modification is initiated by the 5GC and signaled over the

NG-C interface using the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure. In NR-DC, the

modification request for Secondary Node terminated PDU sessions is signaled over the

Xn-C interface.

Modifying the 5QI value can result in the change of the 5QI tables or the change of the

values defined in the following MOs representing the configuration of a QoS profile:

- CUCP5qi
- CUUP5qi
- DU5qi

The modification request of QoS properties is rejected in the gNodeB, if the values of

the CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute change because of the modification of

the QoS properties.

Changes in the 5QI and ARP values can change the assigned UE group for the UE, which can

lead to a change in the configuration of UE group-adapted features.

The ROHC configuration of a DRB affects the QoS modification in the following way:

- If the QoS modification disables ROHC on a DRB where ROHC is enabled, the QoS modification is rejected.
- If the QoS modification enables ROHC on a DRB where ROHC is enabled, the QoS modification is allowed.
- If the QoS modification enables ROHC on a DRB where ROHC is disabled, the QoS modification is allowed, but ROHC is not enabled.

PDU Session Resource Modify Procedure

Dynamic QoS Modification in NR-DC

## 3.1 PDU Session Resource Modify Procedure

The following changes can be applied to an already established Packet Data Unit (PDU)

session during the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure:

- Setting up new QoS flows
- Releasing QoS flows
- Modifying the QoS properties of established QoS flows

Figure 1   PDU Session Resource Modify Procedure

1. The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message that includes the PDU session information to the gNodeB.
2. The gNodeB validates and applies the modification of the QoS properties of the QoS flows in the PDU session.
3. The gNodeB sends the RRC RECONFIGURATION message to the UE. The message contains the modified values of the QoS properties of the used DRBs.
4. The UE sends the RRC RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message to the gNodeB to the modification of the QoS properties of the used DRBs.
5. The gNodeB sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message to the AMF.
6. The UE sends the NAS PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message to the AMF.

## 3.2 Dynamic QoS Modification in NR-DC

In NR-DC, the dynamic modification of QoS properties is done in the PDU Session

Resource Modify procedure and the Secondary Node Modification procedure.

The 5GC sends the new QoS properties to the Master Node in the NGAP PDU SESSION

RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message. For Secondary Node terminated DRBs, the

Master Node forwards the new QoS properties to the Secondary Node in the XnAP

S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message. The Secondary Node applies the changes

to the Secondary Node terminated PDU session. The Master Node triggers the

reconfiguration of the UE by sending the RRC RRCReconfiguration message

to the UE.

The modification request of QoS properties is rejected in the Master Node and Secondary

Node if the value of the CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute is affected

because of the modification.

NR-NR Dual Connectivity

## 3.3 Dynamic QoS Modification in EN-DC

The dynamic modification of the QoS properties of Secondary Node terminated DRBs

(split

and MCG) and E-RABs is performed for the UE in EN-DC.

The

dynamic modification of QoS properties in EN-DC is triggered by the

E-RAB Modify procedure. The modification information is forwarded by the Master Node to

the Secondary Node using the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification

procedure. The EPC sends the S1AP E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message to the

Master Node. The Master Node transfers the modification information of the QoS

properties in the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the Secondary

Node over the X2-C interface.

The Secondary Node applies the modified properties of Secondary Node terminated DRBs with

the received information from the Master Node.

If the application of the

modified

QoS properties is successful, the Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION

REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the Master Node. The Master Node reconfigures

the UE with the modified parameters and sends the X2AP SGNB RECONFIGURATION

COMPLETE message to the Secondary Node.

If the transfer of the QoS modification information is unsuccessful, the Secondary Node

sends the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST REJECT message

to

the Master Node and initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure.

The modification request of QoS properties is rejected in the Secondary Node if the value

of the CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute changes because of the modification

of the QoS properties.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Dynamic QoS Modification

The feature affects retainability KPIs and NR-DC performance.

Capacity and Performance

The following KPIs might degrade when the feature is active:

- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only

Since the gNodeB validates an increased number of QoS parameter values during

QoS modification, the number of PDU Session Resource Modify procedure failures might

increase in the gNodeB resulting in the KPI degradation.

If the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure has modification

information for a QoS property that is not allowed to be modified, the procedure

fails. In EN-DC, when the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification

procedure fails the Secondary Node is released. In NR-DC, when the Master Node

initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure fails the UE and the Secondary Node

are released.

The failure of the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure has

the following effect on the performance:

- UE throughput degradation until the Secondary Node Addition procedure is triggered for the UE.
- In NR-DC, the attempted and successful NR-DC setups are increased.
- In EN-DC, the attempted and successful EN-DC setups are increased.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following interfaces: :

- Xn-C The XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message on the Xn-C interface is updated with the PDU Session Resource Modification Info - SN terminated IE. The XnAP S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message on the Xn-C interface is updated with thePDU Session Resource Modification Response Info - SN terminated IE.
- Xc-C The X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message is updated with the SgNB UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE and the E-RABs To Be Modified Item IE.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Dynamic QoS Modification

The feature does not introduce or affect any parameters.

# 6 Performance of NR Dynamic QoS Modification

Successful and rejected modification of QoS properties can be monitored by using the

PM parameters associated with the feature.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 8.1 23.Q4: Dynamic QoS Modification in EN-DC

The feature enhancement allows the dynamic modification of the QoS properties of

already established Secondary Node terminated DRBs in EN-DC.

| Feature Name           | NR Dynamic QoS Modification   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5622                  |
| Value Package Name     | Advanced RAN Slicing          |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4019                  |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                     |

Summary and Benefits

With the feature enhancement, the EPC can dynamically modify the QCI and the

Allocation and Retention Priority

(ARP)

parameters of an already established Secondary Node terminated DRBs. The

modification is validated in the Master Node and the Secondary Node, and it is

signaled to the UE by the Master Node.

The dynamic modification of QoS properties provides increased flexibility when

changing the characteristics of the service in EN-DC.

Capacity and Performance

If the transfer of the QoS modification information from the Master Node to the

Secondary Node is unsuccessful, the Master Node initiated Secondary Node

Modification procedure fails. As a result, the Secondary Node starts the Secondary

Node Release procedure for the UE. This has the following effects on performance:

- The UE throughput degrades until the Secondary Node Addition procedure is triggered for the UE.
- The number of attempted and successful EN-DC setups might increase. The following PM counters might increase in the Secondary Node: NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeScc NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- The SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI might degrade. This effect can be observed in the Secondary Node. The NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenbAct PM counter is impacted.

The feature enhancement updates the

CuCpProcX2MnInitiatedSgnbModification event in the Secondary

Node.

Operation

The dynamic QoS modification of Secondary Node terminated DRBs is done through the

Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure.

The CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute in the Secondary Node are not

allowed to be modified in an established Secondary Node terminated split DRB.

If the QoS modification affects these attributes, the QoS modification request is

rejected. As a result, the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification

procedure fails and the Secondary Node starts the Secondary Node Release procedure

for the UE.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement updates the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST

message on the X2-C interface.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No

specific network requirements.
