# 1 Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover Overview

The feature prolongs the time holdover period if the primary time synchronization

reference is lost on the node.

Summary

While the primary time synchronization reference is available on the node, over-the-air

measurements from the neighboring nodes are collected and monitored for stability.

If the primary time synchronization reference fails, the node directly switches from

monitoring mode to assisted mode, using the most stable over-the-air source. Stable

over-the-air measurements are actively used to maintain the existing clock

characteristics and high quality.

# 2 Dependencies of Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover

In order for the feature to be operational, the Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring

and the Assisted Time Holdover features must be activated.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature is supported on NR TDD only.

If the node switched to assisted mode, it is not able to provide over-the-air

assistance to other nodes.

The Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature increases cell availability depending

on the following factors:

- Long term stability of the OTA assisting reference
- Radio signal conditions
- Available holdover budget on the assisted node

The Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature, which is a prerequisite of

this feature, must be

activated

to assure that 3GPP TDD synchronization requirements are met. For more information,

see Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover

The feature uses a stable over-the-air

synchronization signal for prolonging the time holdover period if the primary time

synchronization reference is lost.

When the GNSS or PTP over Ethernet G.8275.1 primary time reference is active, the node is

collecting and monitoring the stability of over-the-air measurements from neighboring

nodes.

The Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature activates if a fault happens on the

primary time reference. When the feature activates, the over-the-air assisting reference

becomes active and takes over as assisting reference. During operation, the node remains

time

synchronized in

the RNT TIME LOCKED state. Stable over-the-air measurements are used

to maintain the existing clock characteristics and high quality.

Figure 1   Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover Operation

# 4 Network Impact of Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover

The feature provides increased cell availability for NR TDD nodes and has impact on

the F1-C and Xn-C

interfaces.

Capacity and Performance

The cell downtime is decreased because of the increased cell availability.

Interfaces

The F1-C interface communicates the synchronization information between

the gNodeB control unit and the DU.

The Xn-C interface communicates the synchronization information between

nodes.

Other Network Elements

All nodes in the network need to be upgraded to the software version that contains

the Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature for the communication of backhaul

synchronization information to work. License is only needed for nodes that are

intended to use the feature.

# 5 Parameters for Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover

The feature introduces the

OverTheAirSync MO class that represents properties of termination of

over-the-air synchronization, and enables the AssistingReference MO

class         to encapsulate it.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover

## 9.1 Configure Over-the-Air as an Assisting Time Reference

Prerequisites

- The Over-the-Air Assisted Time Holdover feature license is installed and activated (FeatureState=CXC4012518 is ACTIVATED).
- The RadioEquipmentClock MO is created with the following attribute settings: The RadioEquipmentClock.selectionProcessMode attribute is set to QL\_ENABLED. The RadioEquipmentClock.currentRadioClockReference attribute refers to GNSS or PTP over Ethernet G.8275.1.
- The RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute shows RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED.
- The node is configured with the Radio Interface-Based Time Monitoring feature as an assisting node or as a monitoring node.

Steps

1. Create an OverTheAirSync MO instance under the Synchronization MO.
2. Create an AssistingReference MO instance under the RadioEquipmentClock MO and configure the following attributes:
    1. Set the AssistingReference.encapsulation attribute to point to the OverTheAirSync MO instance created earlier.
    2. Set the AssistingReference.priority attribute to a unique value to be used for this assisting reference instance.
    3. Set the AssistingReference.administrativeState to UNLOCKED.
3. Close the configuration session. A consistence check is automatically done by the managed element after closing the configuration session. The session is closed if the consistency check passes. The configuration session remains open if the consistency check does not pass. If the configuration session remains open, the transaction needs to be closed manually.

Results

One

OverTheAirSync MO and one AssistingReference

MO are created and configured. The created AssistingReference MO

represents the over-the-air assisting reference.
