Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to this feature:

- The feature is only supported in dynamic grants.
- The feature is only supported for Master Node terminated MCG DRBs.
- The feature can only be used in cells with Low-Band or Mid-Band configuration.
- When the UEs are scheduled with PUSCH repetition, SCell scheduling is stopped.

Network Requirements

The UE must support PUSCH Repetition Type A in the band of the PCell.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Dynamic Slot Aggregation for VoNR

The feature sets up PUSCH repetition for UEs if the necessary conditions are

fulfilled.

During UE context setup, the gNodeB checks if the following circumstances apply:

- The UE is in a Low-Band or Mid-Band cell.
- The DRBs that are associated with the UE are part of the MCG.
- The UE supports PUSCH Repetition Type A in the band of the PCell. Note: UEs using the pusch-RepetitionTypeA-r16 IE for indicating capability are considered to support PUSCH Repetition Type A in all valid bands.
- The PuschRepUeCfg.puschRepMode attribute is set to DYNAMIC.

If all of these conditions are fulfilled, the UE is configured with PUSCH Repetition Type

A. This means that the UE can repeat uplink transmissions in multiple slots with a

single uplink grant.

The feature uses the UE Grouping Framework to provide different configuration options for

different UE groups through the PuschRepUeCfg MO.

UEs scheduled with PUSCH repetition are allocated on the edge of the band to prevent

fragmentation. Each of the subsequent retransmissions is allocated on the opposite edge

of the band as the previous one.

The PuschRepRel16Drx MO can be used to set alternative DRX values that

can be used when PUSCH repetition is active. The

PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxMode attribute can be used to further

control which UE uses which DRX timers.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Dynamic Slot Aggregation for VoNR

This feature can affect capacity and performance, UE battery life, and cell

interference.

Capacity and Performance

The feature is expected to improve PDDCH utilization and coverage for UEs in poor

channel conditions. The feature can reduce UE downlink throughput, and can have a

negative impact on PCell and SCell throughput.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature can reduce UE battery life.

The feature can increase cell interference.

# 5 Parameters for NR Dynamic Slot Aggregation for VoNR

The feature introduces the PuschRep, the

PuschRepUeCfg, and the PuschRepRel16Drx MO classes

with attributes for configuring PUSCH

repetition.

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012621 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Dynamic Slot Aggregation for VoNR

The feature supports the creation of different configurations for different UE groups

using the UE Grouping Framework.

To set up UE group specific configurations, the following attributes have to be

configured:

- PuschRep.ueConfGroupType
- PuschRepUeCf.ueConfGroupList
- PuschRepUeCf.ueGroupList
- PuschRepUeCf.prefUeGroupList

It is possible to create DRX profiles for any of these UE groups to override some of the

usual DRX settings with PUSCH repetition-specific ones. This might be necessary when the

UE is in poor channel conditions and needs better PUSCH repetition conditions. For this,

the PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxRetxTimerUl and the

PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxInactTimer attributes can be used.

Increasing the UL retransmission timer or inactivity timer will maintain the PUSCH

performance, but can result in decreased UE battery life.

## 9.1 Controlling DRX timer settings

DRX timer settings can be further controlled using the

PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxMode attribute.

If the PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxMode attribute is set to

FORCED, the PUSCH repetition specific DRX configuration is used for

all UEs in the group. If the PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxMode

attribute is set to ACTIVE, the PUSCH repetition specific DRX

configuration is only used for UEs that do not support starting the DRX HARQ RTT timer

after the end of the last transmission (within a bundle) of the corresponding PUSCH

transmission. UEs that support starting the DRX HARQ RTT timer after the end of the last

transmission (within a bundle) of the corresponding PUSCH transmission use the legacy

DRX configuration.

# 10 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 10.1 24.Q1.0: Enhanced PUSCH Repetition Type A

This feature enhancement improves various aspects of PUSCH Repetition Type A.

| Feature Name           | NR Dynamic Slot Aggregation for VoNR   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5471                           |
| Value Package Name     | Voice over NR                          |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4017                           |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                    |
| Access Type            | NR                                     |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                              |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces frequency diversity for PUSCH Repetition. UEs

scheduled with PUSCH repetition are allocated on the edge of the band to prevent

fragmentation. Each subsequent retransmission is allocated on the opposite edge of

the band as the previous one.

With the feature enhancement, UEs that support starting the DRX HARQ RTT timer after

the end of the last transmission (within a bundle) of the corresponding PUSCH

transmission can use the legacy DRX configuration.

The feature enhancement adds support for suspending SCell scheduling only while PUSCH

Repetition is used. After a certain period of scheduling without PUSCH Repetition,

SCell scheduling is resumed.

These improvements are expected to have the following benefits:

- Improved coverage for UEs in poor coverage
- Improved PDCCH capacity
- Improved DRX performance

Capacity and Performance

UEs that support the new DRX timer behavior are expected to sleep longer.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

PuschRepRel16Drx.puschRepDrxMode attribute for controlling

DRX behavior of UEs scheduled with PUSCH repetition.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

capability handling.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                              |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces support for the

pusch-RepetitionTypeA-v16c0 IE. This IE can be used to

indicate the capability of a UE to use PUSCH Repetition Type A in each band

separately. For more information on the IE, see 3GPP TS 38.306.

Capacity and Performance

Because of the higher number of UEs set up with PUSCH repetition, the following KPIs

can degrade:

- Average DL MAC DRB Throughput
- DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The Uu interface is updated with the pusch-RepetitionTypeA-v16c0

IE in the UE Capability Information RRC message..

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The UE must support the pusch-RepetitionTypeA-v16c0 IE.
