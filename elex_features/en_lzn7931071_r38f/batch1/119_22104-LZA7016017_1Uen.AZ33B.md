Summary

The feature introduces codebook-based beamforming to the PDCCH. This type of

beamforming is based on the Type I Codebook and increases PDCCH coverage and PDCCH

capacity compared to common channel beamforming. UE throughput at the edge of the

cells is increased as a result. The feature also supports a fallback mechanism

between codebook-based beamforming and common channel beamforming to provide

continuous UE connectivity.

Additional Information

For more information about the PDCCH, see Physical Layer Mid-Band and Physical Layer Low-Band.

For more information about the Type I Codebook, see 3GPP TS 38.214, NR;

Physical layer procedures for data.

# 2 Dependencies of Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming

The feature interacts with other features because of the fallback mechanism and the

gain difference between the different types of beamforming.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming

The feature uses UE downlink measurements to create a focused PDCCH beam.

The feature uses codebook-based beamforming for the PDCCH to create a focused PDCCH beam

for a UE. The potential focused beams define an envelope that has an increased coverage

compared to common channel beamforming. PDCCH capacity is also increased.

Figure 1   Increased Coverage of Codebook-Based Beamforming

Codebook-based beamforming uses the PMI to select a UE-specific precoding method for the

PDCCH. The PMI is an information element contained in the CSI report. The UE selects a

precoder matrix from the Type I Codebook based on downlink measurements, and assigns a

PMI to this matrix. The PMI is then sent to the gNodeB as part of the CSI report. This

procedure requires the UE to be in connected mode.

Selecting a UE-specific precoding method results in a focused PDCCH beam for the UE. This

beam has a higher gain compared to the beam created by common channel beamforming. As a

result, the envelope defined by the potential focused PDCCH beams has an increased

coverage compared to common channel beamforming.

For more information about CSI reporting, see the following documents:

- Massive MIMO Low-Band
- Massive MIMO Mid-Band
- Physical Layer Low-Band
- Physical Layer Mid-Band

## 3.1 Fallback Mechanism

The gNodeB uses common channel beamforming instead of codebook-based beamforming if

the PMI is outdated. This helps to provide continuous UE connectivity.

In regions with good PDCCH coverage, common channel beamforming is

used to transmit DCI which aperiodically triggers CSI reports. This helps to achieve

faster recovery if the PMI is outdated or unreliable.

The gNodeB switches between common channel beamforming and codebook-based beamforming

according to the following considerations:

- The gNodeB switches to codebook-based beamforming when there is a significant benefit to gain for the UE compared to the use of common channel beamforming.
- The gNodeB monitors the number of the consecutive uplink HARQ DTXs, and at a predefined threshold, it switches from codebook-based beamforming to common channel beamforming for the PDCCH in both the uplink and the downlink.
- The gNodeB switches back to codebook-based PDCCH beamforming after the next successful CSI report.

# 4 Network Impact of Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming

The feature improves PDCCH coverage and PDCCH capacity and has an E5 interface

update.

Capacity and Performance

PDCCH coverage is increased, resulting in an improved throughput for UEs at the edge

of the cell. PDCCH capacity is increased.

CCE aggregation level 1, 2, or 4 is improved.

If the DL HARQ DTX Rate and the UL HARQ DTX Rate KPIs are degraded after activating

the feature, the system can be configured to be more robust through the

NRCellDU.pdcchLaBfGainFraction attribute.

Interfaces

The E5 Ericsson proprietary interface is updated to properly measure the time between

successful CSI reports.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming

Setting the NRCellDU.pdcchLaBfGainFraction attribute affects

capacity, robustness, and how the PDCCH link adaptation considers the gain

difference.

The NRCellDU.pdcchLaBfGainFraction attribute can be set to favor

capacity or robustness in the following ways:

- If the value is set to the maximum, capacity is maximized. PDCCH link adaptation fully considers the gain difference. Note: The feature is configured to favor capacity over robustness by default.
- If the value is set to the minimum, robustness is maximized. PDCCH link adaptation does not consider the gain difference. This can increase the coverage.
- If the value is set between the maximum and the minimum, the PDCCH link adaptation shifts from capacity enhancement to robustness enhancement. PDCCH link adaptation partially considers the gain difference.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces an improved fallback mechanism, which ensures

that common channel beamforming is used when it can improve performance. Switching

to common channel beamforming can be more beneficial in the following cases:

- Consecutive DTX is detected. With common channel beamforming, the UE is more likely to detect the transmission.
- Aperiodic CSI report is scheduled on aggregation levels 2 or 4. With common channel beamforming, the effects of unreliable or outdated PMI are mitigated, which increases the success rate of transmissions.
- Outdated aperiodic CSI reports are detected. With common channel beamforming, the effects of outdated aperiodic CSI reports are mitigated.

The feature enhancement also introduces hardware support for non-AAS CPRI FDD

radios.

Capacity and Performance

The impact on capacity and performance can be observed through the following

KPIs:

- Both PDCCH robustness and capacity are improved.
- CCE aggregation level 1, 2, or 4 might be improved.
- Uplink and downlink throughput might increase in the cell because of the reduced occasions of PDCCH blocking PDSCH and PUSCH.
- The DL HARQ DTX Rate and the UL HARQ DTX Rate KPIs might increase or decrease depending on the NRCellDU.pdcchLaBfGainFraction attribute.

If the Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming feature is already

activated before this feature enhancement, changes can be observed in the following

KPIs:

- CCE aggregation level 1, 2, or 4 might be degraded.
- Uplink and downlink throughput might be degraded in the cell because of the increased occasions of PDCCH blocking PDSCH and PUSCH.
- The DL RLC Success Rate KPI might increase or decrease.
- The DL HARQ DTX Rate and the UL HARQ DTX Rate KPIs might increase or decrease.

For more information on KPIs, see Key Performance Indicators.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellDU.pdcchLaBfGainFraction attribute, which replaces the

NRCellDU.pdcchLaSinrOffset attribute if PDCCH codebook-based

beamforming is enabled. With the new attribute, the feature can be optimized to

focus more on capacity or robustness.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement introduces hardware support for non-AAS CPRI FDD radios.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement makes it possible to use the Coverage- and

Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming feature with NR Mid-Band CPRI TDD radios.

This feature enhancement also improves the fallback mechanism of the feature. With

the improved fallback mechanism, the gNodeB monitors the number of the consecutive

uplink HARQ DTXs. At a predefined threshold, the gNodeB switches from codebook-based

beamforming to common channel beamforming for the PDCCH in both uplink and downlink.

The gNodeB switches back to codebook-based PDCCH beamforming after the next

successful CSI report.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The feature is supported on a wider range of radios.
- Improved PDCCH BLER performance when codebook-based PDCCH beamforming is enabled.

activated before this feature enhancement, changes can be observed in the following

cases and KPIs depending on network behavior:

- CCE aggregation level 1, 2, or 4 might be degraded.
- Uplink and downlink throughput might be degraded in the cell because of the increased occasions of PDCCH blocking PDSCH and PUSCH.
- The DL RLC Success Rate KPI might increase or decrease.
- The DL HARQ DTX Rate and the UL HARQ DTX Rate KPIs might increase or decrease.
