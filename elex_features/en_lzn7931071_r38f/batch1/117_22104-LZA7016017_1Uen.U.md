# 1 NR Additional Maximum Power Reduction Support Overview

The feature helps UEs to reduce their transmitted power based on 3GPP

requirements.

Summary

The feature supports A-MPR according to the 3GPP standard, so UEs can reduce their transmitted

power to comply with regulatory requirements. All UEs must adjust their maximum

power according to the A-MPR values specified in 3GPP for the selected frequency

bands. With the help of the feature, the UEs receive the necessary signalling values

to set their power to the correct value.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Additional Maximum Power Reduction Support

The feature has interactions with other features, and has an ENM requirement because

an attribute is introduced.

Because of this, power reduction can negatively impact the efficiency of repetition. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

The feature is only supported when the Network Signaling value is set to NS\_04,

NS\_27, or NS\_05U.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 21.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Additional Maximum Power Reduction Support

The Network Signaling value of the cell and the used frequency band are broadcast to the

UEs to allow the calculation of the power reduction for each uplink allocation.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. A-MPR is only activated if the Network Signaling value is set to one of the following values:
    - NS\_04
    - NS\_27
    - NS\_05U
2. If A-MPR is activated, the system checks if the Network Signaling value is consistent with the used frequency band. The allowed combinations are listed in Table 6.2.3.1.1-2: Mapping of network signaling label in 3GPP TS 38.101-1. If the Network Signaling value is not consistent with the used frequency band, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised.
3. The Network Signaling value and the frequency band are mapped to the additional spectrum emission value. To communicate the valid A-MPR settings to the UE, the SIB1 broadcast information is updated with the additional spectrum emission value.
4. At cell unlock, the SIB1 broadcast is sent with the additional spectrum emission value.
5. The UE power reduction is calculated for every uplink allocation. The power reduction is the maximum of the A-MPR and MPR values.

Network Signaling Value

The Network Signaling value is represented by the

NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute, where the value is

determined in the following way:

- For NS\_&lt;two digit number&gt;, the value of the attribute is the value of the two digit number. For example, for NS\_04, it is 4, and for NS\_27, it is 27.
- For NS\_&lt;two digit number&gt;U, the value of the attribute is the value of the two digit number multiplied by 100. For example, for NS\_03U, it is 300.

A-MPR Value

The A-MPR value is determined based on the appropriate tables in 3GPP TS

38.101-1. For example, if the Network Signaling value is

NS\_27, the A-MPR value is determined with the tables in the

A-MPR for NS\_27 section. If the tables show a threshold, the A-MPR

is set to the maximum allowed value.

MPR Value

The MPR value is determined based on Table 6.2.2-1: Maximum power reduction

(MPR) for power class 3 in 3GPP TS 38.101-1. MPR is used by

the gNodeB only if the A-MPR is active.

The MPR value is the highest allowed value shown in the 3GPP specification.

Allocation Types

To determine the A-MPR or MPR values, sometimes it is necessary to know if the

allocation is inner, outer, or edge. For this, the description in the 6.2.2 UE

maximum output power reduction subclause of 3GPP TS 38.101-1

is used. The feature is only applicable for contiguous allocations.

Adjustment to Link Adaptation

Compensation for the power reduction in uplink scheduling is done according to the

A-MPR tables defined in 3GPP TS 38.101-1.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Additional Maximum Power Reduction Support

The feature adds IEs to the NR RRC interface.

Capacity and Performance

The feature can reduce the uplink performance of UEs.

Interfaces

The AdditionalSpectrumEmission and the

NR-NS-PmaxList IEs in the SIB1 message are added to the NR

RRC interface.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Additional Maximum Power Reduction Support

The feature introduces an MO attribute to set the Network Signaling value for the

frequency band.

# 6 Performance of NR Additional Maximum Power Reduction Support

This feature has no associated KPIs, counters, and events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
