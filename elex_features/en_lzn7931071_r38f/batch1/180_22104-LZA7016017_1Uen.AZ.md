Summary

The standalone deployment of NR High-Band enables a self-contained NR RAN that can

operate without support from LTE or other NR deployments. It is designed for medium

to good radio conditions and stationary UEs. FWA UEs can attach directly to the NR

PCells,

perform the random access procedure

and

get in RRC\_CONNECTED state.

This

feature is supported for up to three-sectors and each sector can have up to eight

cells.

Up

to eight carrier components in downlink and up to four carrier components in uplink

are

supported. The supported cell range is

1,100 m.

Data transfer of up to 800 MHz in downlink and 400 MHz in uplink is possible within

a sector. Up to 100 UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED state are supported in each sector.

This feature includes the following functions:

- 5GC-initiated paging with idle mode DRX
- Random access
- Connection establishment
- Data transfer
- Dynamic system information update
- Support for MOCN configurations

Paging

5GC-initiated paging is a functionality which enables the UE to receive and decode

paging messages sent by the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).

The network uses paging to request the establishment of a

Non-Access

Stratum

(NAS)

signaling connection to the UE.

Paging is the only way for the network to notify the UE in idle mode about the

incoming data sessions. Since DRX is normally used by the UEs, broadcast of paging

must occur during a non-DRX or an awake period of the UE. Optimal configuration of

paging and related idle mode DRX parameters can achieve the following benefits:

- It reduces the power consumption of the UE.
- It enables the UE to stay in idle mode and receive notifications through paging when there is incoming data.
- It allows the network to know the location of the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-IDLE stage on Tracking Area level.

UE-specific DRX allows an idle mode DRX cycle to be

negotiated between the UE and the AMF during the NAS registration procedure. The DRX

cycle can be used to page the UE up to the maximum of the default value set in the

Paging.defaultPagingCycle attribute.

Random Access

Random access is one of the basic functions in NR RAN. The UE uses the function for

the following purposes:

- Obtaining access to the NR network
- Gaining uplink time alignment
- Requesting an uplink grant without a dedicated scheduling request source

The CBRA process is initiated by the UE when trying to gain access to the network.

The UE randomly selects one random access preamble code from the available list of

codes. After the selection, the UE transmits the preamble code in uplink through

PRACH to gain access to the network.

Contention can occur under the following conditions:

- Multiple UEs attempt to access the network through the same PRACH slot.
- The UEs that attempt to access the network use the same preamble code.

The CBRA process involves additional signaling to resolve contention.

Connection Establishment

The NR standalone connection establishment function sets up a signaling connection between the

UE and the AMF. When the signaling connection is established, message can be

exchanged between the AMF and the UE through the gNodeB. A type of message exchanged

between the AMF and the UE is the NAS

message.

These messages are used for the following functions:

- Registration
- Registration area update
- Establishment of Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions for the UE

The NR standalone connection establishment function also supports the following

functions:

- Establishment of a secure radio link
- Retrieval of UE radio capabilities that are not available in the gNodeB

Data Transfer

The NR standalone data transfer function enables the network to set up DRBs and

PDU

sessions

to send and receive user data.

The function provides the following possibilities:

- Add QoS flows in existing PDU sessions
- Modify QoS flows in existing PDU sessions
- Remove QoS flows in existing PDU sessions

The AMF

provides

a QoS

Flow

ID (QFI). For more information on QFI, see E2E QoS Guideline.

When the NR RRC Connection Re-establishment feature is configured, the RLF starts a

timer in the gNodeB to wait for the UE to send a request for the RRC connection

re-establishment procedure. If the NR RRC Connection Re-establishment feature is not

configured, the gNodeB releases the UE context without waiting for the request for

the RRC connection re-establishment procedure.

This feature uses network RLF detection. The RLF detection is based on the maximum number of

downlink RLC transmissions that

reaches

DRBs or SRBs. RLF initiates the network to release the UE context.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access

## 3.1 NG-C Interface to 5G Core Network Function

The 5GC architecture is service-based. The system functionality is achieved as a set of

network functions that provide service access to other authorized network functions.

A network function is a component of the network infrastructure that provides a specific

functional behavior. A network function is made up of network function services.

The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) tracks the UE registered in the system.

The AMF coordinates signaling for network functions in the 5GC. It also provides service

operations for initiating NGAP messages towards the gNodeB.

The gNodeB connects to the AMF through the NG-C interface, which

consists of NGAP protocol messages transferred between the AMF and the gNodeB.

### 3.1.1 NG-C Setup

In an NR standalone deployment, the NG-C connection is set up between a gNodeB and the 5GC. The NG-C setup procedure must be preceded by

the creation of the TermPointToAmf MO on the gNodeB. The MO is created with one of the following methods:

- Manually
- By the ENM
- By the system

The NG-C is set up according to the following sequence:

- The NG-C setup process is initiated when the TermPointToAmf MO is unlocked on the gNodeB. This is achieved by setting the TermPointToAmf.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED with one of the following methods: Manually By the ENM By the system
- The gNodeB uses an SCTP to set up a connection to the AMF of the 5GC. A DNS resolver is used when an SCTP association is set up. Table 2 Attributes Supplying the Local SCTP Endpoint IP Address of the AMF IPv4 IPv6 Primary IP Address TermPointToAmf.ipv4Address1 TermPointToAmf.ipv6Address1 Secondary IP Address TermPointToAmf.ipv4Address2 TermPointToAmf.ipv6Address2
- When the SCTP connection is set up, the gNodeB sends an NG-C setup request to the AMF including the following information: NR CGI gNodeB identity PLMN identity TAC Paging DRX
- The AMF sends an NG-C setup response to the gNodeB.
- The TermPointToAmf.operationalState attribute changes to ENABLED.

#### 3.1.1.1 TermPointToAMF Lock and Unlock Procedures

The TermPointToAmf MO represents the connection endpoint of the Access

and Mobility Management Function (AMF) of the 5GC and the gNodeB.

If the TermPointToAmf.administrativeState attribute is set to

LOCKED, the gNodeB initiates an NGAP reset

procedure. After the procedure, the SCTP association between the gNodeB and the AMF is terminated.

If the TermPointToAmf.administrativeState attribute is set to

UNLOCKED, the following procedure is executed:

- The gNodeB initiates an SCTP association to the AMF.
- The gNodeB sends an NGAP NG SETUP REQUEST message to the AMF.
- The AMF sends the NGAP NG SETUP RESPONSE message to the gNodeB.

When the procedure is complete, the NG-C connection between the gNodeB and the AMF exists. The

TermPointToAmf.operationalState attribute is set to

ENABLED and the

TermPointToAmf.availabilityStatus attribute is empty.

### 3.1.2 NGAP Procedures for the NG-C Connection

In an NR standalone deployment, the NG-C connection is set up between the gNodeB and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) of

the 5GC. When the NG-C setup procedure is completed, the gNodeB

and the AMF are connected by the NG-C. If the NG-C connection is functional, the

TermPointToAmf.operationalState attribute is set to

ENABLED.

The gNodeB initiates the appropriate NGAP procedure to

re-establish the NG-C connection to the AMF, if any of the following cases applies:

- NGAP setup after NG-C connection failure NG-C connection re-establishment is started if a failure either in the gNodeB or the AMF occurs, or when the timer set in the GNBCUCPFunction.maxCommonProcTime attribute expires.
- NGAP setup after the gNodeB restarts

A reset of the NG-C connection can be initiated by the AMF if it detects 5GC failure.

During the NGAP reset procedure, the TermPointToAmf.operationalState

attribute remains ENABLED.

#### 3.1.2.1 NGAP Setup after NG-C Connection Failure

The SCTP tracks the NG-C connection between the gNodeB and the

Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) of the 5GC. If there is an NG-C connection

failure, the NG-C link between the gNodeB and the AMF breaks.

When the NG-C link breaks, the following procedure is executed:

- The SCTP receives notification of the NG-C connection failure.
- The TermPointToAmf.operationalState attribute displays DISABLED. As a result, the TermPointToAmf.availabilityStatus attribute changes to DEPENDENCY\_FAILURE.
- The SCTP initiates an SCTP association between the gNodeB and the AMF to restore connection.
- When the SCTP association is restored, the gNodeB starts an NG-C setup procedure by sending the NGAP SETUP REQUEST message to the AMF.
- The AMF responds with the message.
- The NG-C connection between the gNodeB and the AMF is restored, and the TermPointToAmf.operationalState attribute displays ENABLED. As a result, the TermPointToAmf.availabilityStatus attribute is empty.

#### 3.1.2.2 NGAP Setup after Node Restart

The gNodeB initiates and maintains the NG-C connection to the

Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) of the 5GC. If the connection was

established before the restart, the gNodeB re-establishes the

connection after the restart.

The value of the TermPointToAmf.administrativeState attribute is

stored in the gNodeB and retrieved after the node restart

procedure is completed. If the value of the

TermPointToAmf.administrativeState attribute is

UNLOCKED, the gNodeB initiates the NG-C

setup procedure.

## 3.2 Feature Operation of Connection Establishment in High-Band

The UE initial access contains the following procedures:

1. The random access procedure
2. The RRC connection establishment procedure
3. The UE registration procedure, including NAS signaling and the initial context setup

After the initial access, the UE can request to establish a Packet Data Unit (PDU)

session. However, the UE can be registered in the network without a PDU session

establishment.

The NR RAN supports network slice and core network selection mechanisms. These mechanisms

are based on the Single-Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI) list

received from the UE. The NR RAN interacts with the UE over the RRC layer and enables

UE-associated signaling with the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).

Operational Process

Figure 1   Connection Establishment Signaling before Initial Context Setup

Figure 2   Connection Establishment Signaling at Initial Context Setup and Registration

Completed

1. Random Access After the UE decodes SIB1 in the serving cell, the random access procedure is performed between the UE and the gNodeB. Therefore, a signaling connection between the UE and the gNodeB is established.
2. RRC Connection Establishment As part of the RRC connection establishment, the UE sends a Non-Access Stratum (NAS) registration request to the gNodeB in the RRCSetupComplete message.
3. UE Registration - AMF Selection The gNodeB receives the AMF identifier with the UE identity. This is compared with the AMF identity received at NG link setup with one of the following outcomes: If a match of AMF identifiers is found, a matched AMF is available and the corresponding NG-C link is operational, the NGAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE is routed to the specific AMF. If a matched AMF is not available, no match is found or the NG-C link is not operational, a new AMF is selected from the pool that receives the message. If the AMF identifier is a random value in the UE identity, an AMF is selected from the pool. Note: Optionally, if a proper subscription permanent identifier is not found in the UE identity, the AMF initiates the UE identity retrieval. The gNodeB supports the AMF Status Indication procedure over NG-C interface. An AMF is considered as unavailable if its all associated GUAMIs are set to unavailable by Unavailable GUAMI List IE in the AMF STATUS INDICATION message. Note: For more information about AMF STATUS INDICATION procedure, see 3GPP TS 38.413 NG-RAN; NG Application Protocol (NGAP) .
4. UE Registration - NGAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE The NGAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE, which contains the NAS registration request, is sent to the selected AMF by the gNodeB. The NAS registration request triggers the NAS signaling connection which is established between the gNodeB and the AMF.
5. UE Registration - Authentication and Key Agreement After the required UE identifier is available for the AMF, Authentication is performed as follows: The AMF sends the gNodeB the NGAP DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message. This contains the NAS authentication request message. The gNodeB sends the RRC DLInformationTransfer message to the UE. The UE forwards the NAS PDU received in the message. As a response, the UE sends the RRC ULInformationTransfer message to the gNodeB. The message contains a NAS PDU. The gNodeB sends the NGAP UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message to the AMF, forwarding the NAS PDU received from the UE. This message contains the NAS authentication response.
6. UE Registration - NAS Security Activation NAS security context is used by starting the NAS signaling security between the UE and the AMF. The NAS security signaling is performed with the corresponding NAS keys and NAS security algorithms. The procedure comprises the following message exchanges: The AMF sends the gNodeB the NGAP DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message. This contains the NAS security mode command message. The gNodeB sends the RRC DLInformationTransfer message to the UE. As a response, the UE sends the RRC ULInformationTransfer message to the gNodeB. The gNodeB sends the NGAP UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message that contains the NAS security mode complete message.
7. UE Registration - Initial Context Setup The Initial Context Setup procedure establishes the initial UE context in the gNodeB as follows: For more information on the Initial Context Setup in NR Standalone, see 3GPP TS 38.413; Rel-15; NG-RAN; NG Application Protocol (NGAP).
    1. The AMF sends the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the gNodeB. This contains the NAS registration accept message. If the UE is not newly registered, the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message can include the UE capabilities stored in the AMF. If the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message does not contain PDU session information, the UE capability check is performed at the first PDU session establishment.
    2. The NAS REGISTARTION ACCEPT message is forwarded to the UE by the gNodeB in the RRC DLInformationTransfer message.
    3. At the reception of the RRC DLInformationTransfer message, the UE and the gNodeB perform the Access Stratum Security Activation procedure. The gNodeB sends the RRC SecurityModeCommand message to the UE. As a response, the UE replies with the RRC SecurityModeComplete message.
    4. UE Capability Refresh and Reporting The gNodeB evaluates the relevance of the UE capability information supplied by the AMF and initiates the RRC UECapabilityEnquiry message if the UE capability information needs to be refreshed for relevance. The UE reports capabilities by responding with the RRC UECapabilityInformation message. After that, the refreshed set of UE capability information is relayed to the AMF by the gNodeB in the NGAP UE RADIO CAPABILITY INFORMATION message. The refresh is performed if band-specific UE capability information is missing for any of the 3GPP bands carried by all the NRFrequency MOs configured in the gNodeB. Specifically, this covers the case of no UE capability information received from the AMF.
    5. UE Capability Check The UE capability check is performed to optimize the UE radio configuration according to the reported capabilities. If the check is successful, the UE is reconfigured based on its capabilities and the activated features on the gNodeB. This is done by exchanging the RRCReconfiguration and the RRCReconfigurationComplete messages between the gNodeB and the UE. If the UE fails the capability check, it is released to RRC\_IDLE state.
    6. UE Radio Capability Check The purpose of the UE Radio Capability Check is that the AMF requests the gNodeB to indicate if the UE radio capabilities are compatible with the network configurations for IMS voice. The AMF initiates the signaling by sending the NGAP UE RADIO CAPABILITY CHECK REQUEST message to the gNodeB. The required information is sent by the gNodeB to the AMF in the NGAP UE RADIO CAPABILITY CHECK RESPONSE message.
    7. When the initial UE context is established in the gNodeB, it signals this to the AMF by sending the NGAP UE INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.
8. UE Registration - Registration Completed The UE sends the RRC ULInformationTransfer message to the gNodeB, which contains the NAS REGISTRATION COMPLETE message. The UE registration in the network is completed when the AMF receives the NGAP UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message from the gNodeB.

After the UE is registered in the network, it can request to establish a PDU

session.

NR Air Interface Protection

### 3.2.1 Handling of Overlapping Operating Bands

The following attributes contain operating bands signaled in SIB1 to the UE:

- NRCellDU.bandList
- NRCellDU.bandListManual

The

UE goes through the order of bands and picks the first band it supports. The network

then picks the same band for the PCell, and freely chooses the band for the SCells.

Finally, the information is synchronized in the gNodeB.

When the operating bands on the gNodeB overlap, the gNodeB prepares the affiliation of the cells to the different

overlapping operating bands based on UE capabilities.

The gNodeB reconfigures the UE based on its capabilities,

including cell and measurement configurations, with the

RRCReconfiguration message to provide the most optimized UE

connectivity in the network.

## 3.3 UE Capability Check Framework

The UE capability check framework for NR standalone ensures proper UE

handling based on the reported UE

capabilities and the features that are activated on the gNodeB.

It allows for the following mechanisms:

- To perform UE capability check based on network configuration.
- To configure the UE based on the reported capabilities.
- To handle UEs that fail the capability check.

To acquire UE capabilities, the gNodeB initiates the UE

capability enquiry procedure to the UE by using the following exchange of RRC

messages:

1. The gNodeB sends the RRC UECapabilityEnquiry message to the UE. This message contains the network configuration to which the UE capabilities are compared.
2. The UE responds with the RRC UECapabilityInformation message that contains all the capability information the network requested.

The UE capability enquiry procedure is only performed in the following cases:

- The UE capabilities are not received from the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
- The UE capabilities are not stored in the gNodeB
- The received capability information is missing band-specific information for at least one of the 3GPP bands carried by all the NRFrequency MOs configured in the gNodeB

Based on the evaluation of the received UE capability information, the gNodeB proceeds with either of the following:

- Reconfigures the UE to provide the most optimal radio configuration.
- Provides a mechanism for the handling of UEs that fail the capability check by not supporting the minimum capabilities required by the network.

The AMF is updated with the new UE capability information with a UE CAPABILITY

INFO INDICATION message.

## 3.4 Feature Operation of Paging

Paging is used by the core network to notify a specific UE in RRC\_IDLE state about

incoming data sessions. Paging messages are sent by the core network to all gNodeBs in the Tracking Area.

The UE tracks the PDCCH at regular intervals, according to the DRX configuration, to

check for the presence of a paging message. The UE can spend the remainder of the time

in sleep mode. DRX behavior of the UE is configured by parameters broadcast in SIB1.

Operational Process

1. The RAN receives NGAP paging messages without priority.
2. Paging messages are transmitted in all cells within the affected Tracking Area by the gNodeB on the PDSCH. The DCI for paging is broadcast on PDCCH where the information about the modulation and coding scheme of the PDSCH data containing the RRC paging message is found.
3. The DCI for paging on PDCCH is transmitted with a CRC, which is scrambled with the P-RNTI. The DCI for paging notifies the UE about the presence of a paging message.
4. When a UE detects a DCI for paging on the PDCCH, it demodulates and decodes the paging message that is contained in the PDSCH and forwards it over the PCH to the MAC layer. The PCH transport block contains the exact identity of the terminal being paged. If the UE does not find its own identity on the detected PCH, then it discards the PCH data and sleeps, according to the DRX cycle.

### 3.4.1 Reception of NGAP Paging in High-Band

When the NR network receives an incoming data session targeting a UE registered in the

network, the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) tries to notify the UE. It

transmits an NGAP paging message over the NG-C interface to all gNodeB within the Tracking Area where the target UE is

registered. The NGAP paging message contains the information required for the gNodeB to uniquely address the target UE at the non-DRX period

of the UE, that is, when the UE is not in sleep mode.

#### 3.4.1.1 Paging Overload Protection

A paging overload protection mechanism is used to improve gNodeB reliability and

robustness. This mechanism protects the gNodeB from being overloaded by paging signaling

incoming from the core network.

The Paging.pagingDiscardTimer attribute is used to determine how long

a received paging message is retained without being sent. If the configured time

expires, the message is discarded.

Incoming paging intensity is continuously tracked, and if it reaches the maximum allowed

value, the paging message is discarded.

Incoming paging intensity is tracked by NGAP. If there is a paging overload in the

gNodeB-CU, paging messages are discarded and the

GNodeBCUCPFunction.pmPagNgDiscarded counter is stepped.

### 3.4.2 Discontinuous Reception

UEs in idle mode use DRX to reduce power consumption.

Parameters controlling DRX are contained in the SIB1 message broadcast in the cell. These

parameters are used by the UE to calculate when to wake up to monitor the PDCCH. The UE

monitors one paging occasion for each DRX cycle associated with a paging frame. The

length of a paging frame is one radio frame that is 10 ms.

A paging occasion does not necessarily reside inside a paging frame. The paging frame

serves as a starting point for calculating the paging occasion positions. A paging

occasion is a set of PDCCH Monitoring Occasions (PMO) and can consist of multiple time

slots, for example, subframe or OFDM symbol.

The UE uses a formula to calculate its paging frames and paging occasions, indicating

specific subframes that might contain paging messages addressed to that UE. The UE is

required to monitor all of its paging occasions to determine if a paging message is

addressed to it.

The PMOs for paging are determined according to the

pagingSearchSpace identity configured by the RRC.

#### 3.4.2.1 UE-Specific Discontinuous Reception

UE-specific DRX allows UEs to request a DRX cycle that is suitable for the software

applications and services that they support.

UE-specific DRX allows an idle mode DRX cycle to be negotiated between the UE and the AMF

during the NAS Registration procedure. The UE-specific DRX enables the UE to select a

DRX cycle for improved downlink latency at the cost of higher UE battery

consumption.

Lower core network paging latency is expected because UEs can request DRX cycles suitable

for the supported software applications and services.

The DRX cycle can be used to page the UE up to the maximum of the default value set in

the Paging.defaultPagingCycle attribute.

### 3.4.3 Transmission of the RRC Paging Message to the UE

Each gNodeB that receives the NGAP paging message from the Access

and Mobility Management Function (AMF) sends an RRC paging message to the cells that

belong to the Tracking Area stated in the NGAP paging message. The RRC paging message is

transmitted in the paging frame and paging occasion of that specific UE. If the RBS

sends several NGAP paging messages to UEs that have the same paging frame and paging

occasion, then information about more than one UE can be included and broadcast in the

same RRC paging message. The message notifies all the referenced UEs about incoming data

sessions addressed to them.

### 3.4.4 Dynamic System Information Update

This function enables the update of system information in SIB1 while the

TermPointToAmf.administrativeState attribute is set to

UNLOCKED. The gNodeB informs UEs through paging messages to fetch

the updated system information. The paging message that informs the UE is a short

message on PDCCH and it uses DCI format 1\_0. If the system information update in SIB1

and a paging record are scheduled in the same slot, the system information is received

by PDCCH and the paging record is received by PDSCH.

The system information is updated in SIB1 for the following reasons:

- The PLMN list is updated.
- An NG link break occurred.
- The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) configuration is updated.
- The value of the TermPointToAmf.administrativeState is changed.
- The SectorCarrier MO class sent a notification on power change.

The following attributes take effect after the system information is updated

dynamically:

- NRCellDU.imsEmSupportEnabled
- NRCellDU.pZeroNomPucch
- NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant
- NRCellDU.qQualMin
- NRCellDU.qQualMinOffset
- NRCellDU.qRxLevMin
- NRCellDU.qRxLevMinOffset

SIB1 is broadcast only when the NRCellDU.secondaryCellOnly attribute

is set to false.

## 3.5 Feature Operation of Random Access in High-Band

Random access in NR standalone allows the UE to obtain the following network components:

- Access to the NR network
- Uplink timing synchronization

The gNodeB and the UE can set up a successful RRC

connection after the following events occur:

- Sending the random access preamble message
- Exchanging the contention resolution message

In CBRA, the UE randomly selects one random access preamble code from a list of available

codes. Contention can occur when the UE makes multiple attempts to access the cell in

the same PRACH slot with the same preamble code. To resolve contention, CBRA requires

additional signaling at the time of code selection.

The

NR standalone High-Band cell can process 50 accesses per second or one PRACH occurrence

in every second

frame.

For improved coverage, the starting symbol within a slot is symbol 0.

The following requirements must be fulfilled for the random access procedure to

operate:

1. The RACH configuration is applied to the cell.
2. The UE reads the system information in SIB1.

Operational Process

Figure 3   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The gNodeB broadcasts SIB1 on the BCCH.
2. The UE sends a random access preamble on the PRACH to the gNodeB (Msg1).
3. The gNodeB sends the assigned resources through the PDCCH and sends the random access response on the PDSCH (Msg2).
4. The UE sends an RRC SETP REQUEST message on the PUSCH (Msg3).
5. The gNodeB sends the Contention Resolution Message on the PDSCH. Note: This is a PDSCH transmission addressed to the temp-C-RNTI. The temp-C-RNTI contains the UE Contention Resolution Id.
6. The gNodeB sends the RRC SETUP message on the PDSCH.
7. The UE sends the RRC SETUP COMPLETE message to the gNodeB on the PUSCH.

CORESET#0 is used for Msg 1-4 during the RACH procedure. After Msg4 is sent and the

RRC setup is finished, CORESET#1 is used for scheduling the UE.

### 3.5.1 Random Access Preamble Transmission in High-Band

The UE receives system information that enables it to perform a random access attempt.

The following information is provided in the system information:

- SSB postions
- PRACH format to be used
- SSB to PRACH mapping
- RACH occasions

PRACH preamble format A3 is used by default in High-Band standalone deployment.

The UE reads the SSBs. The SSB with the highest signal strength is selected and its index

is provided as part of Msg1.

The preamble is generated by the UE and transmitted over PRACH.

### 3.5.2 Random Access Response Message

The random access response message is transmitted on the PDSCH to a specific RA-RNTI

address. The random access response message can contain responses to more than one

detected random access preamble code. Multiple random access response messages can be

sent within the random access response window. Therefore, the NR system can respond to

random access attempts from multiple UEs, transmitted in the same PRACH subframe.

The UE monitors the PDCCH for the specific RA-RNTI address. The address matches the

subframe number in which the random access preamble burst is transmitted.

The random access response message includes the following information:

- The random access preamble sequence code
- An initial uplink grant for transmitting the subsequent data on the uplink channel
- Time alignment information that ensures the time alignment of subsequent uplink data transmissions. In this way, uplink data transmissions do not interfere with uplink transmission by other UEs in adjacent subframes.
- Temporary C-RNTI

The random access message, which is Msg2, is transmitted using DCI Format 1\_0 on PDCCH. A

PDSCH transmission contains allocation information for the Msg3 PUSCH transmission. The

random access response reception is successful on the following conditions:

- It is received within the random access response search window.
- It contains the random access preamble identifier that matches the transmitted random access preamble index.

### 3.5.3 RRC Setup Request

The UE sends the RRC Setup Request in Msg3 using SRB0. When the RRC SETUP

REQUEST message is transmitted, the UE starts the t300 timer to monitor the

RRC connection establishment procedure. If the procedure is successful, the gNodeB responds to the UE with an RRC SETUP

COMPLETE message. If the procedure fails, the gNodeB

replies with an RRC REJECT message.

In both cases, the UE expects to receive a reply from the gNodeB

before the t300 timer expires.

### 3.5.4 Contention Resolution

After the UE transmitted the RRC SETUP REQUET message, the gNodeB sends the UE a Contention Resolution Id MAC Control

element to resolve the contention. This is followed by an RRC SETUP

message to configure the UE for SRB1.

For NR standalone, contention resolution is realized with the following procedures:

- The gNodeB sends a downlink DCI on the PDCCH.
- The UE decodes a subsequent UE Contention Resolution Id MAC control element on the PDSCH.

The Contention Resolution Id MAC control element is referred to as contention

resolution message.

### 3.5.5 RRC Setup Complete

After the reception of the RRC SETUP message, the UE transmits the

RRC SETUP COMPLETE message on SRB1. The PUSCH transmission carries

the RRC SETUP COMPLETE message. The reception of the PUSCH transmission

in the gNodeB signifies the following:

- The UE received the contention resolution message.
- The CBRA procedure is complete.

### 3.5.6 Power Ramping

The random access transmission process uses open-loop power

control. The UE estimates the transmission power required to achieve a specified

reception power value for the first random access burst. Power ramping can be used for

subsequent retransmission bursts. The process continues until the following conditions

occur:

- The UE successfully receives a response from the NR system.
- The maximum number of transmission attempts is reached.

Figure 4   Power Ramping

## 3.6 Feature Operation of Data Transfer

The data transfer function establishes and configures the requested PDU session and its

DRB to send and receive user data on the network.

### 3.6.1 PDU Session Resource Setup Procedure

The Packet Data Unit (PDU) session resource setup procedure enables the setup of a PDU

session and its corresponding DRB to establish the sending and receiving of user data.

The procedure is initiated by the UE in RRC\_CONNECTED mode. The PDU session can be set

up with the PDU session resource setup procedure or during the initial context setup

procedure.

Figure 5   PDU Session Resource Setup Procedure

1. The UE requests a PDU session establishment through the NAS PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.
2. The gNodeB forwards the UE request to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).
3. The AMF allocates the requested PDU session.
4. The AMF sends a NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message including the PDU session information to the gNodeB.
5. The gNodeB allocates the required SRB and DRB resources and establishes the user plane tunnels.
6. The gNodeB sends the RRC RECONFIGURATION message to the UE.
7. The UE sends the RRC RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message to the gNodeB.
8. The gNodeB sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message to the AMF.

The network is ready to send and receive user data.

### 3.6.2 Inactivity Supervision

In NR standalone, a configurable user plane inactivity timer is configured during the

initial context setup procedure. When the timer elapses, the

Packet Data Unit (PDU) session resource release procedure is triggered.

Figure 6   Inactivity Supervision

1. The InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimer timer expires.
2. The gNodeB sends the NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).
3. The AMF sends the NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the gNodeB.
4. The gNodeB sends the RRC RELEASE message to the UE.
5. The gNodeB releases the UE context.
6. The gNodeB responds with a NGAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message to the AMF.

### 3.6.3 PDU Session Resource Modify Procedure

The following changes can be applied to an already established Packet Data Unit (PDU)

session during the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure:

- Setting up new QoS flows
- Releasing QoS flows
- Modifying the QoS properties of established QoS flows

Figure 7   PDU Session Resource Modify Procedure

1. The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message that includes the PDU session information to the gNodeB.
2. The gNodeB validates and applies the modification of the QoS properties of the QoS flows in the PDU session.
3. The gNodeB sends the RRC RECONFIGURATION message to the UE. The message contains the modified values of the QoS properties of the used DRBs.
4. The UE sends the RRC RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message to the gNodeB to the modification of the QoS properties of the used DRBs.
5. The gNodeB sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message to the AMF.
6. The UE sends the NAS PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message to the AMF.

### 3.6.4 Exceeding System Limits

The number of DRBs for each Packet Data Unit (PDU) session is limited to four, and the

number of DRBs for each UE is limited to eight. If this limit is exceeded when new QoS

flows and DRBs are to be established, the gNodeB rejects the establishment of the

additional QoS flow in the PDU session. The gNodeB then sends the PDU SESSION

RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message to the Access and Mobility Management

Function (AMF) with the rejected flows in the failure list.

## 3.7 TCP Optimization in NR Standalone in High-Band

TCP optimization provides reduced queuing delay in the user plane traffic in an NR

standalone deployment to improve end-user performance. For TCP optimization in NR

standalone, AQM is used in the Radio Link Control (RLC) buffer in the gNodeB if the RLC

buffer includes at least five RLC SDUs.

The AQM mode is set through the AqmCfg.aqmMode attribute and can be

one of the following:

| AQM MODE0   |    | No AQM is used. Packets are discarded if the maximum number of packets is                             reached for each radio bearer in a gNodeB. Packets are also discarded if                             they become older than 1 second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| AQM MODE1   |    | AQM is active. Recommended AQM mode for DRBs with non-GBR traffic.  A single packet is discarded when it becomes older than the minimum age                             threshold. The minimum age of packets is calculated as 2 *                                 AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT.  A prohibit timer, set as 4 * AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT,                             is present between discarding single packets.  All packets that are older than the maximum age threshold are discarded.                             The maximum age of packets is calculated as 10 *                                 AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT. |

## 3.8 Shared NR RAN MOCN Support

This feature supports MOCN configurations in

NR

standalone deployments for High-Band.

This feature supports MOCN configurations if the Shared NR RAN feature is also active in

the node. For more information, see Shared NR RAN.

This feature has privacy and security implications due to the MOCN support. For

recommended actions, see Privacy Implications of Shared RAN Features in

Manage Security.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access

This feature can decrease downlink throughput, and uses NGAP and RRC messages to set

up and maintain connection with the UE.

Capacity and Performance

NR Standalone High-Band cells can process 50 accesses each second or one PRACH

occurrence in every second frame.

The overhead from SIB1 and paging decreases downlink throughput. The actual overhead

varies with paging information and the number of UEs in the PCells.

This feature allows for a cell coverage range of up to

4,000 m.

For cell ranges over 1,100 m, the Extended Propagation Delay Support

High-Band feature must be activated.

This feature extends the cell coverage range by configuring an additional gap symbol

in special slots between downlink and uplink. Using the additional gap symbol

reduces downlink throughput. No degradation in uplink throughput is expected.

Additional

gap symbols are configured if the value of the

NRCellDU.cellRange attribute is higher than 579 m or no value

is set for the attribute. If no value is set for the

NRCellDU.cellRange attribute, the cell coverage range is set

to the default value of 1,100 m. The increase in cell coverage range and the

resulting downlink throughput reduction are shown in Table 3.

Table 3   Downlink Throughput Reduction due to Additional Gap Symbol

| Cell Range (m)   |   Gap Symbols between Dowlink and Uplink | Downlink Throughput Reduction   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access

## 9.1 Configure NG-C Interface Termination Point between gNodeB and the Core Network

Steps

1. Create the SctpEndpoint MO.
2. Set the local port number for SCTP endpoint in the SctpEndpoint.portNumber attribute to 38412.
3. Create the GNBCUCPFunction MO.
    1. Configure the GNBCUCPFunction.gNBId attribute with gNodeB identity.
    2. Configure the NRCellDU.pLMNIdList attribute with the applicable PLMN identity, so that the GNBCUCPFunction.pLMNId attribute contains the actual value.
4. Create the LocalSctpEndpoint MO under the EndpointResource MO that is referred by GNBCUCPFuntion.endpointResourceRef attribute.
5. Set the LocalSctpEndpoint.interfaceUsed attribute to NG.
6. Set the LocalSctpEndpoint.sctpEndpointRef attribute to an instance of the SctpEndpoint MO.
7. Create the TermPointToAmf MO.
8. Set the primary and secondary IP addresses of the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) of the 5GC under the TermPointToAmf MO based on the IP protocol they use. The TermPointToAmf.ipv4Address1 attribute represents the primary IPv4 AMF address, while the TermPointToAmf.ipv4Address2 attribute represents the secondary IPv4 AMF address. The TermPointToAmf.ipv6Address1 attribute represents the primary IPv6 AMF address, while the TermPointToAmf.ipv6Address2 attribute represents the secondary IPv6 AMF address. Configure the IP addresses in one of the following ways: IP Address Version Configurable Attribute IPv4 address TermPointToAmf.ipv4Address1 and TermPointToAmf.ipv4Address2 IPv6 address TermPointToAmf.ipv6Address1 and TermPointToAmf.ipv6Address2

Results

The TermPointToAmf MO is defined with the AMF IP address.

An NG-C connection for the NG-C setup procedure exists between the gNodeB

and the AMF in the 5GC.

Related Information

3GPP TS 38.412, NG-RAN; NG signalling transport, Release 15, 7

## 9.2 PLMN Service Is Unavailable Because of NG-C Link Break

The gNodeB and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)

of the 5C are connected by an NG-C link. If all NG-C links for a specific PLMN break,

the gNodeB loses connection to all AMFs supporting the PLMN, and

the PLMN service becomes unavailable.

If the PLMN service is not available because all NG-C links for a specific PLMN break,

the PLMN Service Unavailable alarm is raised with the additional

text indicating the PLMN with unavailable service.

## 9.3 Cell Range and Root Sequence Index Settings

The RRC configuration of the UE involves the setting of the

prach-RootSequenceIndex and the

zeroCorrelationZoneConfig attributes. For the settings of these

parameters defined in 3GPP, see 3GPP TS 38.211; NR; Physical Channels and

Modulation.

The NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attribute configures the value of the

prach-RootSequenceIndex attribute and

zeroCorrelationZoneConfig is set by the gNodeB.

## 9.4 Inactivity Timer Configuration

The NR standalone Data Transfer function enables a configurable user plane inactivity

timer. When the timer elapses, an NR Standalone UE release is triggered.

Table 6   Configurable Timer

| Timer Name                              | Time Duration                                                               | Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimer | Configurable, 10 s default value  Minimum value: 1 s  Maximum value: 7200 s | The time period while the NR standalone UE can be inactive before UE                                 release. |

## 9.5 Configure Paging for High-Band Cells

Paging configuration affects UE power saving and latency.

Paging is enabled by default in all PCells. For High-Band cells, the supported values

for the Paging.n attribute are T1\_2 or lower.

The value of this attribute affects UE power saving and latency.

Steps

1. Perform one of the following actions:
    - Set the Paging.defaultPagingCycle attribute to a higher value such as 256 if higher UE power saving is desired.
    - Set the Paging.defaultPagingCycle attribute to a lower value such as 32 if shorter latency is desired.

Feature Operation of Paging

## 9.6 Configure the PCell

PCells must be configured manually.

Prerequisites

- Both uplink and downlink must be enabled on the sector carrier of the PCells.
- The NR Standalone High-Band with Multiple PCell Support feature must be activated if more than one PCells are configured in each sector.
- PCells must have the lowest ARFCN in the sector among cells that have both uplink and downlink.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.secondaryCellOnly attribute to false on the PCells. This attribute controls the transmission of the SIB1 in the cell. Note: Only one PCell can be configured in each sector if the NR Standalone High-Band with Multiple PCell Support feature is not activated.
2. Set the NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attribute to 1 in the PCells and the PSCells. It is recommended to set this attribute to different values in each cell if there are neighbor PCells or PSCells in the same frequency. For example, if this attribute is set to 0 in a PCell, it must be set to 8 in a neighbor PCell.
3. Set the UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell to false to prevent placing PCells on the E-UTRAN frequency that is defined in the EUtranFreqRelation MO instance.
4. Set the NRCellDU.ssbDuration attribute to one of the following values:
    - empty
    - 3
5. Leave the NRCellDU.ssbFrequency and the NRCellDU.ssbOffset attributes as their default values to use auto-selection. These values can be configured manually, as well, if the use of auto-selection is not desired.
6. Set the NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute to OVERLAP.
7. Set the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute to NOT\_ALLOWED.

## 9.8 Attribute Changes Related to NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

Some attributes used by the NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access feature

are planned to be deprecated by the NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

feature.

The following attributes are applied when the

GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute and the

GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute are set to

false:

- CUUP5qi.aqmMode
- CUUP5qi.estimatedE2ERTT
- CUUP5qi.packetDelayBudget
- CUUP5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset
- CUUP5qi.tOooUlDelivery
- DU5qi.aqmMode
- DU5qi.estimatedE2ERTT
- DU5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset

The following attributes introduced by the NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature

are applied for the GNBCUUPFunction and

GNBDUFunction MO classes when theGNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute and the

GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute are set to

true:

- AqmCfg.aqmMode
- AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT
- AqmCfg.tDiscardDl
- AqmCfg.tOooUlDelivery

If the deprecated attributes are not in use in the configuration, it is recommended to

configure the attributes introduced by the NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

feature in the configuration to avoid any migration impact.

Restarting the node is required after the values of the

GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute and the

GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute are

changed.

For more information regarding the affected attributes and

migration impact, see NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile.

## 9.9 Configuration Options for Idle Mode Cell Reselection

It is possible to configure

gNodeBs

in NR Low-Band and Mid-Band cells to allow cell reselection towards cells in NR Standalone

High-Band deployments in idle mode.

### 9.9.1 Cell Reselection from NR Low-Band and Mid-Band to NR Standalone High-Band

It is possible to configure the

gNodeBs

in NR Low-Band and Mid-Band cells to allow cell reselection towards NR Standalone High-Band

cells in idle mode.

Configuring Cell Reselection

It is recommended to configure cell reselection in the following ways:

- Configure the gNodeB in NR Low-Band and Mid-Band cells to allow cell reselection to NR standalone High-Band cells in idle mode through the SIB2 and SIB4 system information broadcasts.
- Configure the gNodeB in NR Low-Band and Mid-Band cells to prevent connected mode mobility to High-Band frequencies.
- Do not configure NR standalone High-Band-capable UEs with dedicated cell reselection priorities that override the values provided in the system information broadcast.

Allowing Idle Mode Cell Reselection

Cells in NR Low-Band or Mid-Band deployments can be configured to allow cell

reselection towards cells in NR standalone High-Band deployments for UEs in idle

mode. To allow cell reselection,

an

instance of the NRFreqRelation MO class must be created for the

NR standalone High-Band frequency in the Low-Band or Mid-Band

cell.

It is recommended to configure the following attributes of the

NRFreqRelation MO instance in the Low-Band or Mid-Band gNodeB

to allow cell reselection to High-Band frequencies for NR Standalone

High-Band-capable UEs:

- Set the NRFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority and the NRFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attributes to the highest possible cell reselection priority value for the High-Band frequency.
- Set the NRFreqRelation.qQualMin and the NRFreqRelation.qRxLevMin attributes in the NR Low-Band or Mid-Band cell to the same values as the values set in the NR Standalone High-Band cell.
- Set the NRFreqRelation.threshXHighP and the NRFreqRelation.threshXHighQ attributes to 0 to enable cell reselection to the NR Standalone High-Band PCell immediately when the cell selection criteria are fulfilled.

Preventing Sending Dedicated Cell Reselection Priorities

It is recommended to set the

TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.actionAtRelease attribute to

DISABLED to prevent the gNodeB in NR Low-Band and Mid-Band

deployments from sending dedicated cell reselection priorities to NR standalone

High-Band-capable UEs at connection release.

Preventing Connected Mode Measurements and Mobility to High-Band

Frequencies

When

an NRFreqRelation MO instance exists in the NR Low-Band or

Mid-Band cell, the following NR features might start measurements on NR standalone

High-Band frequencies when the UE is in connected mode:

- NR Automated Neighbor Relations
- NR Minimization of Drive Tests
- NR Mobility
- NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements
- NR Traffic Steering
- UE Coverage Measurements

To prevent these features from performing measurements, the gNodeB in Low-Band and

Mid-Band cells must be configured to exclude the High-Band frequency. Table 7 shows the recommended attribute

configurations in the gNodeB

for

NR Low-Band or Mid-Band

deployments

to

prevent measurements and mobility to High-Band frequencies in connected mode.

Table 7   Recommended Attribute Settings for the NR Standalone High-Band

NRFreqRelation MO Instance

| Feature Name                          | Attribute Name                                 | Recommended Setting   |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| NR Automated Neighbor Relations       | NRFreqRelation.anrMeasOn                       | false                 |
| NR Minimization of Drive Tests        | NRFreqRelation.mdtMeasOn                       | false                 |
| NR Mobility                           | UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell | false                 |
| NR Security-Initiated UE Measurements | UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor            | 0                     |
| NR Traffic Steering                   | UeMCNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell | false                 |
| UE Coverage Measurements              | UcmNrFreqRelProfile.ucmTargetFactor            | 0                     |

When the attributes are configured to prevent measurements and mobility to High-Band

frequencies in connected mode, blind RwR can still be triggered for the UE by the NR

Remote Interference Management feature. To prevent triggering blind RwR, it is

recommended to set the value of the

OffloadNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rimOffloadType attribute to

NOT\_ALLOWED.

Using the recommended settings for the attributes does not prevent setting up NR-DC

configurations for UEs. Manual configuration of cell relations between the Low-Band

or Mid-Band PCell and the High-Band PSCells is required to set up

NR-DC

for UEs.

# 10 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 10.1 24.Q1.0: MOCN and Extended Cell Range Support for NR Standalone High-Band for Fixed Wireless Access

This feature enhancement adds support for MOCN and extends the cell coverage range to

1,100 m

for NR Standalone High-Band deployments.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement extends the cell range support of NR Standalone High-Band

networks up to

1,100 m.

Support for MOCN configurations is introduced for NR Standalone High-Band

deployments, which allows networks to be shared between up to 12 operators. MOCN

configurations can be used in NR Standalone High-Band deployments if the Shared NR

RAN feature is also active in the node.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement allows for a cell coverage range of up to

1,100 m.

This feature enhancement extends the cell coverage range by configuring an additional

gap symbol in special slots between downlink and uplink. Using the additional gap

symbol reduces downlink throughput. No degradation in uplink throughput is

expected.

An additional gap symbol is configured if

the

value of the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute is

higher

than

579 m

or no value is set for the attribute. If no value is set for the

NRCellDU.cellRange attribute, the cell coverage range is set

to the default value of

1,100 m.

The increase in cell coverage range and the resulting downlink throughput reduction

are shown in Table 8.

Table 8   Downlink Throughput Reduction due to Additional Gap Symbol

| Cell Range (m)   |   Gap Symbols between Dowlink and Uplink | Downlink Throughput Reduction   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0–579            |                                        2 | 0%                              |
| 580–1,100        |                                        3 | 3%                              |

This feature enhancement does not introduce any PM counters. However, existing PM

counters can be used to observe performance in MOCN configurations.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the cell range-related performance

of the feature:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioRaAttTaDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1MaxMsg3Sched
- NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbFailMsg1Ooc
- NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbFail3Dtx

The following PM and EBS counters can be used to observe downlink MAC PDU volume in

serving cells in a MOCN configuration for each UE:

- NRCellDU.pmEbsnMacPduVolDlUePCell
- NRCellDU.pmEbsnMacPduVolDlUeSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacPduVolDlUePCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacPduVolDlUeSCell

Operation

This feature enhancement has privacy and security implications due to the MOCN

support introduced. For recommended actions, see Manage Security.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is applicable for the following units (12 SSBs only):

- AIR 1281 with configuration mode 1 and 2
- AIR 5322 with configuration mode 1 and 2
- Streetmacro 6705 with configuration mode 1 and 2

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version

23.3 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows an idle mode DRX cycle to be negotiated between the

UE and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) during the

Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) Registration procedure. This DRX cycle can be used to page

the UE up to the maximum of the default value set in the

Paging.defaultPagingCycle attribute.

This feature enhancement enables the UE to select a DRX cycle for improved downlink

latency at the cost of higher UE battery consumption.

Lower core network paging latency is expected because UEs can request DRX cycles

suitable for the supported software applications and services.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to improve DRX

observability:

- NRCellDU.pmPagDiscardedRan
- NRCellDU.pmPagReceivedRan

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the NRCellDU.ueSpecificDrxMode

attribute, which is enabled by default. Therefore, UE-specific DRX is enabled for

the newly created and for the existing NRCellDU MO instances.

This feature enhancement can be disabled by setting the

NRCellDU.ueSpecificDrxMode attribute to

DISABLED.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the NG-C interface by adding the

Paging-DRX IE to the NGAP PAGING message.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

The AMF must support UE-specific DRX and the UE must request a DRX cycle in the NAS

Registration Request message.
