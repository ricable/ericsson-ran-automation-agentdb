Summary

The Jumbo Frames feature allows Ethernet frames with a maximum payload length of 9000 bytes.

An Ethernet jumbo frame is defined as having a payload larger than 1500 bytes.

Jumbo frames provide a more efficient use of the available network bandwidth in high traffic

conditions. When this feature is enabled, the number of packets per second is

reduced for all involved UEs. This means that the feature efficiently handles

traffic when packet processing is a bottleneck.

# 2 Dependencies of Jumbo Frames

The configurations of the

Jumbo Frames feature must be supported by the relevant Ethernet-related network

elements.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The jumbo frame size must be supported by all Ethernet switches the jumbo frames

cross.

The configured frame size must be supported by all destination Ethernet ports.

# 3 Feature Operation of Jumbo Frames

The

Jumbo Frames

feature allows Ethernet frames with a maximum payload length of 9000 bytes.

The Baseband unit supports jumbo frames on the Ethernet ports. To use this function, the MTU

value must be configured accordingly.

The default MTU for Baseband IP interfaces is 1500 bytes. This can be modified in the

InterfaceIPv4 MO or the InterfaceIPv6 MO.

However,

using a larger MTU size for the IP interfaces can have a negative effect on the

performance.

For Ethernet jumbo frames, the RBS supports the MTU of 9000 bytes. Depending on the frame

types supported by the Baseband unit, the used MTU can be lower than the configured MTU.

To send IP packets that exceed the Ethernet MTU, the IP layer must first fragment the packets

to align with the Ethernet MTU.

Even if Ethernet jumbo

frames of 9000 bytes are supported on the transport level in Baseband, the configuration of

jumbo frames on the UE level might cause fragmentation and reassembly in other parts of the

network and lower

performance.

Switching and Bridging Operation

The Jumbo Frames feature is always enabled for switching and bridging operations. Jumbo

frames are supported for tagged and untagged frames. The operation flow is the following:

1. A packet with a payload of up to 9000 bytes is received on a port of the switch or bridge.
2. The packet is switched or bridged in the same way as ordinary Ethernet packets, as described in Ethernet Switching. The MAC learning process and tables remain the same. This means that the packet is either sent out on the outgoing interface, or broadcast out on all interfaces except the incoming interface. This is independent of whether the packet is a normal or a jumbo frame.

IP Routing and IP Termination Operation

The IP routing and IP termination operation flow is the following:

1. A packet with a payload of up to 9000 bytes is received on a port of the router, or is generated internally for sending on an outgoing interface.
2. The packet is routed as an ordinary IP packet that has a length of up to 1500 bytes, as described in Static Routing and OSPFv2.
3. If necessary, fragmentation is performed to avoid sending an IP packet or fragment larger than the configured MTU of the outgoing link.
4. The packet or fragment is sent out on the outgoing interface.

Even though jumbo frames are supported on both incoming and outgoing interfaces,

fragmentation can be required if the interfaces have a different MTU. Some equipment in the

network cannot support frames with payloads of up to 9000 bytes even if they support the

Jumbo Frames feature.

If fragmentation is not allowed, the packet is discarded and a Packet too

big Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message is sent back to the

source.

For more information on fragmentation, see the following documents:

- RFC 791: Internet Protocol
- RFC 1122: Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers
- RFC 2460: Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification

# 5 Parameters for Jumbo Frames

This feature is affected by parameters related to the MTU.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter         | Type      | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| InterfaceIPv4.mtu | Affecting | The value of the MTU can be configured by this parameter. |
| InterfaceIPv6.mtu | Affecting | The value of the MTU can be configured by this parameter. |

# 6 Performance of Jumbo Frames

This feature has no associated KPIs, counters, and events.

KPIs

The feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Jumbo Frames

E2E

MTU settings need to be adjusted to avoid fragmentation.

To achieve the best performance and prevent fragmentation, the

E2E

MTU must be adjusted based on what the Baseband and the transport network can handle.

The E2E MTU being the MTU over the air interface and in the packet core.

Figure 1 gives the E2E view of the user plane

network protocol stack with IPsec for an NR SA network. For the LTE and NR NSA setup

this looks similar, except that the SDAP layer is not relevant there.

Figure 1   User Plane Protocol Stack with IPsec (NR SA)

Even if jumbo frames of 9000 bytes are supported on the transport level in Baseband, the

configuration of jumbo frames on the UE level might cause fragmentation and reassembly

in other parts of the network and lower performance.

Maximum supported E2E MTU size of 1888 bytes

The maximum supported GTP-U packet size in the Baseband is 1930 bytes. Considering

the possible RAN overhead in the worst-case scenario of 28 bytes, and additional

consideration for future extensions of 14 bytes (for example over F1-U interface),

this 1930 bytes GTP-U packet size in Baseband corresponds to a maximum supported E2E

MTU size of 1888 (1930 - 28 - 14) bytes.

The worst case considers the remote leg in the NR-DC deployment, where the overhead

is as follows:

8B (GTP-U header) + 4B (GTP-U optional header) + min 8B (DL User Data) + 3B (PDCP) +

4B (MAC-I) + 1B (SDAP) = 28 bytes.

E2E MTU size of 1888 bytes, requiring an MTU size of 2091 bytes in the transport

network to avoid fragmentation

This applies in case the RAN traffic is protected by IPsec and IPv6 is used in both

inner and outer network as follows:

1888B + 28B (GTP-U + RAN overhead) + 14B (future extension) + 8B (UDP) + 40B (inner

IPv6) + 73B (maximum ESP overhead) + 40B (outer IPv6) = 2091B.

The ESP overhead can be 22-73 bytes depending on the used encryption and integrity

algorithms. It also depends on the padding, which differs depending on the size of

the inner IP packet to be sent. For example, in case of AES\_GCM\_16, the ESP overhead

is 34-37 bytes (depending on the padding).

Configuring IP interface MTU when using jumbo frames

The default MTU for Baseband IP interfaces is 1500 bytes. When using jumbo frames,

the IP interface MTU must be manually configured in theInterfaceIPv4.mtu and InterfaceIPv6.mtu

attributes.

To prevent fragmentation in an IPv4 transport network, the MTU in Baseband must be

configured according to the MTU in the transport network. This is needed for the

outer InterfaceIPv4 in case of IPsec, or the

InterfaceIPv4 used by the application (for interfaces like S1

and NG) in case of no IPsec.

In case of an IPv6 transport network, the MTU in Baseband is automatically adjusted

with Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD). The MTU in Baseband can therefore be set to 9000

bytes.

In case of IPsec, the MTU for the inner interface in Baseband is automatically

adjusted based on the MTU for the outer interface and the IPsec overhead. The MTU

for the inner interface can therefore be set to 9000 bytes.

For more information about the ESP overhead for different algorithms, and adjustment

of MTU for inner interface, see IPsec.

For more information about configuration of transport and MTU, see Manage Transport Network.

MTU settings in different deployments

Table 3 shows the required MTU in the

transport network in different deployment with maximum E2E MTU of 1888 bytes. In all

cases, additional overhead of 50 bytes apply (for GTP-U + RAN overhead of 28 bytes,

future extensions of 14 bytes, and UDP of 8 bytes).
