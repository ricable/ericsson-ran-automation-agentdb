Summary

Certain weather conditions can cause atmospheric ducts, which might affect the cells

and cause interference between downlink and uplink slots. The feature detects and

identifies cells that are affected by remote interference and detects the

interference level difference between the special slot and the uplink slot.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Remote Interference Detection

The feature has a dependency towards the Downlink Slot Blanking for TDD Pattern

Coexistence feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Remote Interference Detection

The feature can identify remote interference by measuring the declining noise slope

character between the uplink symbol in the special slot and the last DMRS symbol in the last

uplink slot.

Atmospheric Duct

Atmospheric duct is a seasonal, weather-dependent phenomenon, which can duct the

downlink signal of the cell traffic to follow the curve of the Earth, traveling

further with less attenuation. In TDD networks, when a guard period no longer offers

sufficient protection against cross-link interference, atmospheric duct can cause

interference in the uplink traffic of other cells with the same frequency.

Figure 2   Interference Slope Character

Remote Interference Detection

Figure 3   TDD Uplink and Downlink Switching Period for Consecutive and Single Uplink

Slots

Figure 3 shows the possible cases for

one-shot slope detection for different TDD patterns.

The remote interference detection process is the following:

1. The NRCellDU.rimDetectionEnabled is set to true.
2. The interference level difference is calculated by the gNodeB for each TDD uplink and downlink switching period from the interference levels of the front and the end symbol for remote interference detection. If the difference is high, a one-shot slope is detected.
3. If the slope ratio is over 50% during the RIM detection period, the NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState attribute is updated to true. The NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState attribute is updated at the end of every RIM detection period.
4. If unexpected high interference is detected during the RIM detection period, the NRCellDU.rimHighIpnState attribute is updated to true. The NRCellDU.rimHighIpnState attribute is updated at the end of every RIM detection period.

Interference States

Interference states can be identified using the

NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState and the

NRCellDU.rimHighIpnState attributes.

Table 2   Interference States

| Attribute                                                              | NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState =                                         false                                 | NRCellDU.rimDetectedSlopeState =                                         true                                                  |

counter.

DuPerCellRimRep

PM event to provide observability of the slope ratio for each remote interference

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
