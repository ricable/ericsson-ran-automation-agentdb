Summary

If two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, the two signals possibly create PIM. PIM signals created by

downlink carriers can interfere with signals transmitted by uplink carriers. If PIM

is detected, PIM supervisor triggers PIM avoidance.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Automatic configuration of PIM avoidance based on PIM detection results
- Increased observability of PIM avoidance gains through a PM counter

# 2 Dependencies of NR PIM Avoidance

The accuracy of results provided by the NR PIM Avoidance feature can be affected by

the presence of other activated features.

Hardware

The feature is only supported on Remote radio units with external antenna.

Limitations

- The feature supports only NR FDD sector carriers.
- The feature supports only a single Baseband unit.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 22.2 or later is required

for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR PIM Avoidance

The feature relies on identifying the slots when PIM-affected UE is transmitting and

requesting muting in those slots. This feature handles up to three aggressor sector carriers

for each victim sector carrier based on the PIM detection results.

Enabling and Disabling the Feature

The feature does not require license activation. To enable the feature, the NR PIM

Detection feature is required to be activated, and the

NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidLevel attribute must be set to a

non-zero value.

The feature can be disabled by setting the

NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidLevel attribute to

0.

PIM Avoidance Status

The PIM avoidance status is represented by the

NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidStatus attribute. It has the

following statuses:

| true   |    | PIM avoidance is active.   |
|--------|----|----------------------------|
|        |    |                            |
| false  |    | PIM avoidance is inactive. |

After the feature is enabled, PIM avoidance becomes active for a sector carrier if

any aggressor sector carriers are detected for the given victim sector carrier.

# 4 Network Impact of NR PIM Avoidance

The feature can reduce downlink and mute PDSCH resources to decrease PIM-originated

interference power.

Capacity and Performance

Configuring the feature with information on detected aggressors imposes negative KPI

impact on downlink, related with occasional muting of the PDSCH resources which aim

to decrease PIM-originated interference power.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

- NRCellDU.pmPdschPimBlankedSlot
- NRCellDU.pmPdschPimBlankingReq
- NRCellDU.pmRadioRecEffectiveIpNPwrDistr

The feature also affects the following PM counters:

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q3: NR PIM Avoidance in Baseband

The feature enables NR PIM avoidance on the Baseband Radio Node.

Summary and Benefits

When two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, the two signals possibly create PIM. PIM signals created by

downlink carriers can interfere with signals transmitted by uplink carriers. When

PIM is detected, PIM supervisor triggers PIM avoidance.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Automatic configuration of PIM avoidance based on PIM detection results
- Increased observability of PIM avoidance gains by an introduced PM counter

Capacity and Performance

Configuring the feature with information on detected aggressors imposes negative KPI

impact on downlink. Muting of the PDSCH resources, which aim to decrease

PIM-originated interference power, also occurs.

Operation

The following MO attributes are introduced:

- NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidDlMutingPeriod
- NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidLevel
- NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidStatus

The NRSectorCarrier.pimAvoidLevel attribute must be set to a

non-zero value in order to enable this feature. The change takes effect immediately

after the attribute is configured.

The following PM counters are introduced:

- NRCellDU.pmPdschPimBlankedSlot
- NRCellDU.pmPdschPimBlankingReq
- NRCellDU.pmRadioRecEffectiveIpNPwrDistr

The NRCellDU.pmRadioRecEffectiveIpNPwrDistr counter can be used to

observe measured noise and interference power on PUSCH for each uplink

transmission.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 22.2 or later is required for this feature.
