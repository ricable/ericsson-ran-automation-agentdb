known limitations.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later for this

feature.

The UE must be a RedCap UE as specified in 3GPP TS 38.306 Release 17 and

compliant with the 17.2.0 or later version of the RRC protocol.

The gNodeB must be compliant with the 17.2.0 or later version of the NGAP

protocol.

The gNodeB must be compliant with the 16.11.0 or later version of the XnAP

protocol.

# 3 Feature Operation of Ericsson Reduced Capability Enabler

RedCap support is controlled by SIB1 and SIB4 IEs on the NR cell level.

Support for RedCap UEs is controlled on the NR cell level for connection establishment

and on the frequency relation level for mobility. Mobility support for RedCap UEs

includes connected mode mobility and idle mode mobility.

RedCap UEs can access and perform mobility to NR Low-Band cells that are part of an

ESS cell pair. For

more

information on

ESS-related features, see Ericsson Spectrum Sharing All-In-One User

Guide.

RedCap Support Control

SIB1 contains information that helps evaluate if a RedCap UE is allowed to access a

cell.

The cellBarredRedCap1Rx-r17 and the

cellBarredRedCap2Rx-r17 SIB1 IEs, which are used to indicate if a

cell is barred for RedCap UEs, are controlled by their corresponding MOM attributes

in the following way:

- If the NRCellDU.redCap1RxEnabled attribute is set to true, the value of the cellBarredRedCap1Rx-r17 IE is set to notBarred and is sent in SIB1.
- If the NRCellDU.redCap2RxEnabled attribute is set to true, the value of the cellBarredRedCap2Rx-r17 IE is set to notBarred and is sent in SIB1.

If the NRCellDU.redCap1RxEnabled or the

NRCellDU.redCap2RxEnabled attribute is set to

true, the intraFreqReselectionRedCap-r17

IE, which controls intra-frequency mobility, is set to allowed and

it is sent in SIB1.

SIB4 contains information relevant for inter-frequency mobility, including

information about NR frequencies and neighboring inter-frequency cells. SIB4

information can also be used for idle and inactive measurements.

The redCapAccessAllowed-r17 SIB4 IE is used to indicate if

RedCap UEs can access a given frequency.

The redCapAccessAllowed-r17 IE is controlled by the

NRFreqRelation.redCapEnabled attribute. The

redCapAccessAllowed-r17 IE is only sent in SIB4 if the

NRFreqRelation.redCapEnabled attribute is set to

true.

Xn Signaling between gNodeBs to Indicate RedCap Support

Information about RedCap support is shared between gNodeBs for mobility purposes.

RedCap support information is sent in SIB1. When the value of the

NRCellDU.redCap1RxEnabled or the

NRCellDU.redCap2RxEnabled attribute is changed, the updated

value is transferred from DU to CU in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE

F1AP message. The value of the attributes is then sent to all external gNodeBs. If

the F1-C interface is not configured, the new attribute value stays in the DU until

it is transferred to the CU in the F1 SETUP REQUEST F1AP message.

Xn signaling between gNodeBs is achieved through sending the RedCap

Broadcast Information IE in the Served Cell Information

NR IE in the following XnAP messages:

- NG-RAN NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE
- XN SETUP REQUEST
- XN SETUP RESPONSE

After the content of the RedCap Broadcast Information IE is

received, it is stored in the gNodeB CU for each external NR cell to determine if

RedCap UEs can connect to the target cell.

Identification

RedCap UEs are detected at connection establishment and at incoming handovers.

At connection establishment, RedCap UEs are identified by LCID 35, which

is found in the MAC subheader of Msg3. If a RedCap UE is identified at connection

establishment, the RedCap support value is set in the

RedCap indication IE field of the INITIAL UL RRC

MESSAGE TRANSFER F1AP message, which is sent to the CU.

At incoming NG handovers, RedCap UEs are identified by the

supportOfRedCap-r17 IE in the

UE-NRCapability IE. If RedCap UEs are not

supported in the target cell according to the SIB1 configurations, the handover is

rejected and the RedCap UE not supported IE is sent in the

HANDOVER FAILURE NGAP message.

For handovers from LTE cells, the RedCap indication IE is sent in the HANDOVER

REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE NGAP message.

## 3.1 Cell Capacity for RedCap UEs

The number of RedCap UEs that a cell can admit can be scaled in increments on the

cell level.

Basic Capacity Support

RedCap UEs are not supported on the network by default. The admission of RedCap UEs

can be enabled and configured on the cell level if the required resources are

available.

The Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package provides support for up to 20 RedCap UEs

in cells where Ericsson Reduced Capability is enabled.

Extending the RedCap UE Capacity Support

Cell capacity limit for RedCap UEs can be scaled individually based on capacity

requirements with the NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute. This

allows extending the supported number of RedCap UEs of the cell.

The operator can enable additional Ericsson Reduced Capability value packages that

offer capacity resources for extended capacity on cells where the Ericsson Reduced

Capability Base Package is already enabled.

The following value packages offer extended levels of capacity support on the cell

level for the Ericsson Reduced Capability product and RedCap UEs:

- The Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer value package extends the capacity support for up to 100 RedCap UEs.
- The Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity value package provides capacity support for an unlimited number of RedCap UEs.

The Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package and the value packages fulfill different

levels of capacity requirements. The value packages provide additional capacity

units as resources for extended RedCap UE support. The RedCap UE cell limit can be

configured based on the available capacity units.

When

configuring capacity resources, the available resources must be divided between the

cells. In each cell, each capacity level must be built on the resources provided by

the previous level. This means that capacity levels that provide lower capacity

resources always act as a foundation that can be expanded with the next capacity

level.

## 3.2 RedCap UE Cell Capacity Levels

Each level of RedCap UE support requires the appropriate capacity resources and

configurations.

Basic RedCap UE Support

The basic capacity support for RedCap UEs allows the cell to admit up to 20 RedCap

UEs.

This configuration requires the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package to be

enabled.

To

enable this configuration on the cell level, the

NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute must be set to

BASIC.

Advanced RedCap UE Support

The advanced capacity support for RedCap UEs allows the cell to admit up to 100

RedCap UEs.

This configuration requires the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package and the

Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer value package to be enabled.

To

enable this configuration on the cell level, the

NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute must be set to

ADVANCED.

Maximum RedCap UE Support

The maximum capacity support for RedCap UEs allows the cell

to

admit an unlimited number of RedCap UEs. The RedCap UE capacity

of the cell is limited only by the capacity limitations imposed on the Baseband.

This configuration requires the following base and value packages:

- Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package
- Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer
- Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity

To

enable this configuration on the cell level, the

NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute must be set to

MAXIMUM.

## 3.3 RedCap UE Rejection

RedCap UEs can be rejected from connecting to a cell if the cell lacks the required

capacity resources or the capacity limit is exceeded.

No RedCap UEs are admitted to the cell if the available Ericsson Reduced Capability

capacity resources

are insufficient for supporting the

configured RedCap UE capacity level of the cell. This happens if the RedCap UE capacity

level of the cell is misconfigured and does not match the available capacity resources.

In this case, the MO Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the

Key

alarm

is raised.

RedCap UEs are also rejected from connecting to a cell if the

Ericsson

Reduced Capability Enabler feature is not activated.

If the number of RedCap UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode exceeds the capacity limit of the cell,

additional RedCap UEs

can

only be admitted in the following cases:

- The RedCap UE requests an emergency voice call.
- The RedCap UE performs RRC\_CONNECTED mode mobility.
- The RedCap UE sends an RRC connection reestablishment request.

# 4 Network Impact of Ericsson Reduced Capability Enabler

The feature introduces IEs to enable support for RedCap UEs.

Capacity and Performance

RedCap UEs are expected to work with lower maximum throughput compared to non-RedCap

UEs because of the lower bandwidth support of the RedCap UE type.

EBS-N events can be filtered for RedCap UEs with the redCapUe UE

grouping selection criterion to observe the behavior of RedCap UEs connected to the

network.

The number of RedCap UEs is included in the total number of RRC\_CONNECTED UEs for

each capacity module and in each cell.

The number of DRBs and the SE/TTI value for RedCap UEs is the same as non-RedCap NR

UEs.

Interfaces

This feature affects the following interfaces:

- Uu The UE-NRCapability IE is updated with the following IE fields: supportOfRedCap-r17 longSN-RedCap-r17 am-WithLongSN-RedCap-r17 The RRC SIB1 message is updated with the following IE fields: cellBarredRedCap1Rx cellBarredRedCap2Rx intraFreqReselectionRedCap The RRC SIB4 message is updated with the redCapAccessAllowed-r17 IE field.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Ericsson Reduced Capability Enabler

Configuring two BWPs allows RedCap

UEs

to operate on a smaller portion of the total cell bandwidth.

To allow

RedCap

UEs

to connect to cells with bandwidths larger than 20 MHz, the option to

configure two BWPs in connected mode is introduced.

The following BWPs must be configured:

| InitialBWP   |    | Used                             for common signaling. It is configured with                             the                             minimum channel bandwidth, which is 20 MHz for FDD and must be                             configured to 20 MHz for TDD.                   |
|--------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P-BWP1       |    | Used                             for UE-dedicated traffic.                             It is configured with the                             same bandwidth as InitialBWP during the following procedures:  RRC connection setup     RRC connection resume     RRC re-establishment |

## 9.1 Configuring the RedCap UE Capacity Limit on the Cell Level

The number of RedCap UEs that a cell can admit can be scaled in increments,which can

be done by distributing the available resources between the cells.

Cells can be configured incrementally with up to three capacity levels using the

following base and value packages:

- Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package
- Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer
- Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity

The Ericsson Reduced Capability base and value packages allow the scaling of the RedCap

UE capacity of the cell. Each package provides resource units for different capacity

requirements. The capacity resources represent capacity units and can be enabled on the

cell level in increments.

When configuring capacity resources, the available resources must be divided between the

cells. In each cell, each capacity level must be built on the resources provided by the

previous level. This means that capacity levels that provide lower capacity resources

always act as a foundation that can be expanded with the next capacity level.

### 9.1.1 Configure RedCap UE Capacity Limit for Three Cells

This example configuration uses three cells. RedCap UE support and the RedCap UE

capacity limit are enabled in all three cells through the

NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute on the cell level. Because

of the different RedCap UE capacity requirements of the three cells, each cell is

configured to support a different capacity level.

The capacity requirements in this example configuration are as follows:

- Cell A requires support for 20 RedCap UEs.
- Cell B requires support for 100 RedCap UEs.
- Cell C requires support for an unlimited number of RedCap UEs.

To configure the three cells with different capacity levels, the following capacity

resources are required from the capacity pool available to the operator:

- Three capacity resource units provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package.
- Two capacity resource units provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer value package.
- One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity value package.

Prerequisites

The appropriate number and type of license keys are available through the Ericsson

Reduced Capability base and value packages and are configured in the LKF for all

three cells.

Steps

1. Lock the following cells:
    - Cell A
    - Cell B
    - Cell C
2. Set the NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute of Cell A to BASIC. This configuration requires the following capacity resources: One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package. The available pool of capacity resources fulfills the configuration, and a capacity limit for 20 RedCap UEs is set on Cell A. The following pool of capacity resources remains after this configuration: Two capacity resource units provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package. Two capacity resource units provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer value package. One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity value package.
3. Set the NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute of Cell B to ADVANCED. This configuration requires the following capacity resources: One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package. One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced value package. The available pool of capacity resources fulfills the configuration, and a capacity limit for 100 RedCap UEs is set on Cell B. The following pool of capacity resources remains after this configuration: One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package. One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer value package. One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity value package.
4. Set the NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute of Cell C to MAXIMUM. This configuration requires the following capacity resources: One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Base Package. One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Advanced Explorer value package. One capacity resource unit provided by the Ericsson Reduced Capability Maximum Capacity value package. The available pool of capacity resources fulfills the configuration, and an unlimited capacity is set on Cell C for RedCap UEs. All the available capacity resources are consumed by this configuration.
5. Unlock the following cells: The RedCap UE capacity limit configured on the cells is enforced after the cell is unlocked.
    - Cell A
    - Cell B
    - Cell C

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to scale the RedCap UE capacity

of each cell according to the capacity requirements and the available capacity

resources.

This feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Fine-tuned control over the distribution of RedCap UEs in the network
- Increased observability of RedCap UEs in the network

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement is expected to increase the number of RRC connection

releases for cells in which the RedCap UE limit is reached. This can affect cells in

which the NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit attribute, which defines the

configured capacity level, is set to a value other than the default.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the NRCellDU.redCapUeLimit

attribute. This attribute can be used to configure the RedCap UE capacity level of

the cell based on the capacity requirements and the available capacity resources.

to remove non-RedCap-capable candidate frequencies when the NR Remote

Interference Management feature is triggered. This allows the RedCap UE

to be redirected to a RedCap-capable frequency as soon as possible.

If the UE is a RedCap UE, the target frequency selected for RwR by the

NR Remote Interference Management feature must be the frequency with the lowest

ARFCN that supports RedCap UEs. If no such frequency is available, the

target LTE frequency is selected based on legacy handling.
