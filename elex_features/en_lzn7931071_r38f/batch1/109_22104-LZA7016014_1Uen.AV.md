# 1 Virtual Routers Overview

The main purpose of the Virtual Routers feature is to separate traffic and routing

information between different IP domains.

Summary

The following are examples of traffic separation:

- Separating OAM and RAN traffic
- Separating traffic between operators sharing a network

The Virtual Routers feature enables shared networks in which address planning can be

done independently for each domain.

Additional Information

For more information about the feature, see Manage Transport Network.

# 2 Dependencies of Virtual Routers

The configuration of dynamic routing protocols is limited to only one virtual

router.

| Feature               | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSPFv2 (FAJ 121 4727) | Related        | When two or more virtual routers are configured, the OSPFv2 feature                                 can only be configured under one virtual router. The router instance                                 under which OSPFv2 is configured can be freely chosen. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Virtual Routers

The Virtual Routers feature makes it possible to configure multiple routers in a node,

instead of a single router.

Each router has its own routing and forwarding table. No routing of packets between virtual

routers is done in the node. Each virtual router, which forwards traffic, has a separate IP

configuration that includes static routes and interfaces. As a result, the network topology is

divided into multiple subnetworks, one for each virtual router.

All Router MO instances have the same characteristics and

capabilities.

The Layer 2 interfaces, VLANs, and Ethernet ports are connected to the router by an IP

interface. Two virtual routers can use the same VLAN ID if their IP interfaces encapsulate

different VlanPort MOs. A physical port can be shared by two virtual

routers only if the routers have different VLAN IDs.

# 4 Network Impact of Virtual Routers

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

# 5 Parameters for Virtual Routers

This feature has no configuration parameters.

# 6 Performance of Virtual Routers

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 23.Q1: Increased Number of Virtual Routers

configuration items. The following are the new limits:

- Virtual Routers: 60
- Virtual Routers supporting SCTP-based interfaces: 12
- Interface IPv4: 120
- Interface IPv6: 120
- Address IPv4: 120
- Address IPv6: 120
- VLAN Port: 120

The benefits of this feature enhancement are the following:

- More routers can be configured in the node.
- Configuration flexibility is increased for implementation of network designs based on traffic separation principle.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is supported on Baseband in RAN Compute Group 4 and 5. There

is a limit for virtual routers supporting SCTP-based interfaces set to 12 due to the

high memory consumption of SCTP servers for larger configurations.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 23.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced

by this feature enhancement.
