Summary

RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode scales the power consumption of RAN Compute units based

on hardware utilization. Power consumption is decreased by powering down the unused

hardware components of a capacity module and powering them up only when hardware

utilization must be increased.

# 2 Dependencies of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

This feature is only supported on certain RAN Compute groups. Automatic activation

and deactivation of the feature requires the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature to be

activated.

Hardware

This feature is supported on RAN Compute units in RAN Compute groups 5 and 6, except

for Streetmacro 6705. For more information on RAN Compute groups, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Limitations

This feature does not support LTE single mode. The feature supports NR+LTE Mixed Mode

Baseband configurations by decreasing the power consumption of the NR node.

If an NR capacity module is sleeping while the

RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature is enabled, and the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature

triggers the wake-up of a cell, then all cells related to the same sleeping capacity

module are woken up. In this case, the

NRCellCU.pmCellBoosterCarrWakeUp PM counter is only pegged for

the cell that triggered the wake-up. For the remaining cells in the same sleeping

capacity module, the NRCellCU.pmCellBoosterCarrWakeUp PM counter is

not pegged when those cells wake up.

An exception

is when the Booster Carrier Sleep feature might attempt to trigger the wakeup for those

cells based on traffic load. This results in the

NRCellCU.pmCellBoosterCarrWakeUp Pm counter pegging additionally.

For deployments where this behavior is not desirable, the RAN Compute

Deep Sleep Mode feature must be disabled.

Network Requirements

For manual activation and deactivation, it is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this

feature.

For automatic activation and deactivation based on the NR Booster Carrier Sleep

feature, it is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature.

If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are

supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

When the RAN Compute Deep Sleep feature is enabled and its activation is triggered,

the feature powers down unused RAN Compute hardware components. When deactivation of the

feature is triggered, the RAN Compute hardware components are powered up because of

increased hardware utilization.

The RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature can be enabled or disabled on supported RAN

Compute units by setting the PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepEnabled

attribute to true or false. The default value of the

attribute is true.

The PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus attribute shows the status of

the feature on a RAN Compute unit. If the feature is enabled, the status changes between

ACTIVATED and DEACTIVATED. If the RAN Compute unit

does not support the feature, the attribute is set to

NOT\_SUPPORTED.

Activation and deactivation of the feature can be triggered manually or automatically, as

shown in the following table:

Table 2   Triggers for Activation and Deactivation of the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

Feature

| Trigger Action         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manual activation      | The NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState                                     attributes are manually set to LOCKED, for                                     example, because of decreased traffic load.                                                                            |
| Automatic activation   | The NRSectorCarrier.availabilityStatus                                     attributes are set to OFF_DUTY automatically by                                     the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature.                                                                              |
| Manual deactivation    | The NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState                                     attribute is manually set to UNLOCKED, for                                     example, because of increased traffic load.                                                                            |
| Automatic deactivation | The NRSectorCarrier.availabilityStatus                                     attribute is set to NO_STATUS automatically by                                     the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature after waking up the cells                                     from sleep mode. |

The RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature operates separately from the Radio Deep Sleep

Mode feature. For example, even if all sector carriers related to a capacity module are

locked or asleep, the radio unit is not required to enter Radio Deep Sleep Mode.

However, RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode is activated in such a case.

When the feature is activated, the amount of time needed to unlock a sector carrier might

be increased by the amount of time needed to power up RAN Compute hardware components

that serve the capacity module related to that sector carrier.

NR+LTE Mixed Mode Baseband configurations benefit from the reduced power consumption

provided by the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature. When the feature is enabled and the

conditions for activation are fulfilled, the feature powers down the RAN Compute

hardware components of the NR node.

Operational Process

When the feature is enabled, it is activated and deactivated based on the criteria in

Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Activation of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram of Feature Activation

1. All sector carriers related to an NR capacity module are locked manually or put in sleep mode automatically.
2. If it is possible to power down the RAN Compute hardware components, then the capacity module is put in sleep mode, and the RAN Compute hardware components that serve that capacity module are no longer in use. The feature powers down the unused RAN Compute hardware components, resulting in decreased power consumption. Note: Powering down is only triggered automatically by the NR Booster Carrier Feature if the EpBoosterCellFunction.wakeupRequiredTime attribute or the DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime attribute is configured to a value that is higher than the wake-up time of the RAN Compute Deep Sleep feature.
3. If the value of the PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus attribute is not ACTIVATED, then the attribute is set to ACTIVATED and the PowerSaving.pmRanCompDeepSleepTime PM counter is started.

Deactivation of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram of Feature Deactivation

1. The first sector carrier on any sleeping NR capacity module is unlocked manually or woken up automatically, while the value of the PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus attribute is ACTIVATED.
2. The capacity module is woken up. The feature powers up the RAN Compute hardware components that serve the capacity module. Note: This step is only applicable for the first time any of the sector carriers related to a capacity module are unlocked or woken up. Unlocking or waking up additional sector carriers on the same capacity module has no effect, because the capacity module is already powered up.
3. If any of the RAN Compute hardware components that serve a capacity module are still powered down, the PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus remains set to ACTIVATED.
4. If all RAN Compute hardware components on all capacity modules are powered up, the PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus attribute is set to DEACTIVATED and the PowerSaving.pmRanCompDeepSleepTime PM counter is stopped. Note: The feature is also deactivated when the RAN Compute unit is restarted while the sector carriers are locked. In this case, the RAN Compute hardware components are not powered up.

# 4 Network Impact of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

The feature can be used with other features and functions that decrease power

consumption for further power savings.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode is not dependent on the Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature or

the Baseband power savings function, but all of them can be enabled and activated at

the same time to further decrease power consumption. For more information, see Radio Deep Sleep Mode and Manage Hardware Equipment.

# 5 Parameters for RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

This feature introduces new attributes to configure and monitor the status of the

feature.

Table 3   Parameters

| Parameter                           | Type       | Description          |
|-------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepEnabled | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus  | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

The feature introduces a new counter, and uses existing counters to monitor power

consumption.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The feature uses the following PM counters to monitor the power consumption of the

RAN Compute units:

- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergy
- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated
- EnergyMeter.pmMaxPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmMinPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmVoltage
- PowerSaving.pmRanCompDeepSleepTime

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q3.0: Automatic Activation of RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode

This feature enhancement allows the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature to be

activated and deactivated automatically by the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                     |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature can be

activated and deactivated without locking and unlocking sector carriers manually.

This allows dynamic automated scaling of the power consumption of supported RAN

Compute units. Automatic activation and deactivation are based on the NR Booster

Carrier Sleep feature.

The feature enhancement also introduces a new PM counter which measures how long the

RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature is active for.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement negatively affects the node capacity when it powers down RAN

Compute hardware components automatically to lower power consumption.

Operation

Automatic activation and deactivation of the feature requires both the RAN Compute

Deep Sleep Mode feature and the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature to be enabled.

The feature enhancement introduces the

PowerSaving.pmRanCompDeepSleepTime PM counter. The PM counter

is started when the PowerSaving.ranCompDeepSleepStatus attribute

is set to ACTIVATED at the end of the feature activation process.

The PM counter is stopped when the attribute is set to DEACTIVATED

at the end of the deactivation process. The counter is applicable for both automatic

and manual activation and deactivation of the feature.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

Automatic activation and deactivation of the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature is

only available on radios that support the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
