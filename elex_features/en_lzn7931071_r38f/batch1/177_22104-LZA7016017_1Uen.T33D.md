Summary

The feature introduces a framework for automatic PCI conflict detection and reporting in NR

Standalone deployments. This allows for the following:

- Fast PCI conflict detection and resolution reporting for NR or LTE cells.
- Automatically identifying cells likely to cause PCI conflicts.
- Support for intra-system mobility based on NCGI measurements if the target cell is in PCI conflict.

The feature can also be used for PCI planning in customer networks to avoid PCI conflicts in

NR or LTE cells.

The temporary PCI conflict is                                 resolved when these cells are reconfigured and start transmitting                                 again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

At maximum six PCI conflicts can be recorded in the MO instances for the respective

cells. If more than six conflicts are detected, the cell information for any further

PCI conflicts cannot be recorded in the MO instances for the respective cells. If

one PCI conflict is resolved, the isPciConflicted attribute of

the cells is set to NO. The data on the resolution is kept, unless

all six slots for PCI conflict information are used. In this case, the resolution

data is overwritten.

The PM events generated on PCI conflict detection only include information on three

instances of cells in PCI conflict. If more than three cells are in PCI conflict,

the same PM event with the information on the same three cells is generated.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR PCI Conflict Reporting

The feature introduces automatic PCI conflict detection and resolution reporting, which

allow for fast PCI conflict resolution for NR cells.

The feature can automatically detect PCI conflicts. The following types of PCI conflict

exist:

- PCI collisions
- PCI confusions

| PCI collision   |    | A PCI collision occurs when a cell has a cell relation with another cell and                         they share the same PCI and frequency.                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| PCI confusion   |    | A PCI confusion occurs when a cell has cell relations with two other cells                         that share the same PCI and frequency. In cases like this, handovers can                         target the incorrect cell due to the confusion. |

## 3.1 PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting in NR Standalone Deployments

The feature can automatically detect and report PCI conflicts in NR standalone

deployments.

The automatic detection and reporting of PCI conflicts in NR standalone deployments can

be enabled by setting the PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled

attribute to true.

The detection of PCI conflicts is performed by scanning cell relations for cells that use

the same PCI and frequency.

When the feature is active, PCI conflict evaluation is triggered by the following

events:

- The PCI conflict detection and resolution reporting function is activated.
- A neighbor NR cell relation is automatically or manually added.
- A neighbor NR cell relation is automatically or manually removed.
- A neighbor LTE cell relation is automatically or manually added.
- A neighbor LTE cell relation is automatically or manually removed.
- An ExternalEUtranCell MO instance is modified.
- One or more served cells are added.
- The PCI of a neighbor NR cell is changed manually or via the X2 or Xn interface
- The frequency of a neighbor NR cell is changed manually or via the X2 or Xn interface

If a PCI collision is detected, the NRCellCU MO class and the relevant

ExternalNRCellCU or ExternalEUtranCell MO

class is updated. If a PCI confusion is detected, only the relevant

ExternalNRCellCU and ExternalEUtranCell MO

instances are updated. The following attributes are updated in the applicable MO

instances:

| isPciConflicted          |    | This attribute is set to YES if the cell is detected as part                         of any PCI conflict.          |
|--------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          |    |                                                                                                                    |
| pciConflictedCell        |    | This attribute is set to the CGI of all neighbor cells that this cell is in                         conflict with. |
|                          |    |                                                                                                                    |
| pciConflictDetectingCell |    | This attribute is set to the CGI of the cell that detects the PCI conflict                         for this cell.  |

If the PCI conflict is reported on a lightweight neighbor cell relation object, the

lightweight object is automatically promoted. In case the maximum number of neighbor

objects is reached, the gNodeB attempts to perform ranking-based automatic demotion. If

ranking-based automatic demotion is disabled, the gNodeB searches for cell relation MO

instances where all the attributes except for the isRemoveAllowed

attribute are set to the default value. Cell relation MO instances in PCI conflict are

not considered for removal or demotion. Then, from these MO instances, the gNodeB

demotes the MO instance that has the longest unused period. If the promotion of the

conflicting lightweight object is still not possible, no promotion is performed. For

more information on ranking-based automatic demotion, see NR Automated Neighbor Relations.

When new PCI conflicts are detected, the CuCpPciConflictDetectedEutra or the

CuCpPciConflictDetectedNr PM event is triggered. The PM event only contains up to three

conflicting cells.

If the PCI conflict evaluation detects that one of the conflicts reported earlier is

resolved, all the relevant MOM attributes are set to indicate no conflict. If the

NrCellCU MO has no more PCI conflicts, for specific PCI a

frequency, the CuCpPciConflictResolvedEUtra or the CuCpPciConflictResolvedNr PM event is

triggered.

## 3.2 Automatic Detection of Potential PCI Conflicts with Unknown Cells

The feature can automatically detect cells that are likely to cause PCI

conflict.

It is possible that a cell is in range of two other cells that are in PCI conflict, but

only has a cell relation to one of them. In such a case, the detection of PCI conflict

based on cell relations alone is not possible. This cell without a relation is likely to

cause PCI conflict.

If PCI conflict detection and reporting is enabled, the gNodeB can detect cells that are

suspected to be in PCI conflict based on the ratio of successful handovers to a neighbor

cell.

PCI conflict detection and reporting are enabled as follows:

- For NR cells by setting the PciConflictNR.pciConflictDetectionThreshNr attribute to a valid value.
- For LTE cells by setting the PciConflictEUtran.pciConflictDetectionThreshLTE attribute to a valid value.

If the ratio of successful handovers drops below the configured value for a neighbor

cell, a cell with the same PCI and frequency is likely to exist that is not configured

as a neighbor. In this case, the gNodeB configures the UE with an NCGI measurement for

NR cells, or an ECGI measurement for LTE cells. The use of CGI measurements triggered by

possible PCI conflict can be enabled or disabled for each UE group using the

PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDetectionNcgiMeas attribute for NR

cells and the PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDetectionEcgiMeas

attribute for LTE cells.

If the UE acquires the SIB1 of the cell, the CGI measurement report is sent to the

gNodeB. If the cell in the measurement report is the unknown cell, a neighbor relation

is created, and it is marked as having PCI conflict. If the cell in the measurement

report is the known cell, no new neighbor relation is created and the handover proceeds

based on the CGI measurement report to the known cell.

## 3.3 NCGI Measurement-Based NR Intra-System Mobility

Handovers to a neighbor cell in PCI conflict can be completed using information from

an NCGI measurement report.

The gNodeB can be configured to configure the UE with an NCGI measurement if there is a

handover to a cell in PCI conflict. This can be enabled by setting the

PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictMobilityNcgiMeas attribute to

FR1, and setting the

PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled attribute to

true.

If the UE acquires the SIB1 of the cell, the NCGI measurement report is sent to the

gNodeB. If the cell in the measurement report is an unknown cell, a neighbor relation is

created, and it is marked as having PCI conflict. If the cell in the measurement report

is a known cell, no new neighbor relation is created and the handover proceeds based on

the NCGI measurement report to the known cell.

The use of NCGI measurements for handover to a cell in PCI conflict can be enabled or

disabled for each UE group using the

PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictMobilityNcgiMeas attribute.

## 3.4 ECGI Measurement-Based Inter-System Mobility

With the ECGI Measurement-Based Inter-System Mobility function, ECGI measurements can

be used during a cell conflict to ensure that UEs are handed over to the correct

cell.

The ECGI Measurement-Based Inter-System Mobility function is adapted to the UE Grouping

Framework.

The following attributes must be configured to enable this function:

- The value of the PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled attribute is set to TRUE.
- The value of the PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictMobilityEcgiMeas attribute is set to ENABLED.

When the UE reports a cell conflict in a B1 or B2 measurement report, the gNodeB can

configure the UE with an ECGI measurement. Using the measurement report, the gNodeB can

resolve the conflict and perform a handover to the correct cell for the UE.

The procedure is performed with the following steps:

1. The UE sends a B1 or B2 measurement report for IRAT inter-system mobility to the gNodeB.
2. If the reported cell is in PCI conflict, the gNodeB requests an ECGI measurement from the UE. For this, the UE must be able to perform the ECGI measurement.
3. Depending on whether the ECGI measurement report is successfully received, and if the cell relation exists for the reported cell in the ECGI, one of the following actions is taken: If both conditions are fulfilled, the gNodeB performs the IRAT inter-system handover or release with redirect to LTE on the target cell that is indicated by the ECGI measurement report. If the measurement report is received but there is no existing cell relation, an additional lightweight EUtranCellRelation object is created through the NR Automated Neighbor Relations feature. If no measurement report is received, a UE mobility action is not performed. If an additional measurement report is received for the same PCI, the target cell can be selected automatically by either the CGI hit rate or manual configuration. For more information, see CGI Hit Rate-Based and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility.

## 3.5 CGI Hit Rate-Based and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility

When the ECGI Measurement-Based Inter-System Mobility function or NCGI

Measurement-Based NR Intra-System Mobility function cannot be performed, this function is

performed instead.

When attempting handover to a cell in PCI conflict, if the UE lacks the capability for

the required CGI measurement, or the measurement fails, the following types of handover

can be performed for the UE based on statistics collected from previous CGI measurements

or to a manually configured preferred cell:

- CGI hit rate-based handover
- Manual configuration-based handover

The following attributes must be configured to enable the functions:

- The value of the PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled attribute is set to TRUE.
- Depending on the handover type, the following configuration is used: For configuration in E-UTRAN cells, see CGI Hit Rate-Based and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility for E-UTRAN Cells. For configuration in NR cells, see CGI Hit Rate-Based and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility for NR Cells.

These functions can be triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- Any of the following conditions is true: The UE is connected with NR-DC. The UE does not support CGI reporting.
- More than two cell relations exist in the cell with the same PCI on the same reference frequency.

CGI Hit Rate-Based and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility for NR Cells

The CGI Hit Rate-Based Mobility and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility functions can

be triggered on NR cells if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- For NR intra-system handover, the PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictTargetSelectMode attribute is set to one of the following values: CGI\_HITRATE\_BASED MANUAL\_BASED CGI\_HITRATE\_MANUAL\_BASED MANUAL\_CGI\_HITRATE\_BASED
- The value of the PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictMobilityNcgiMeas attribute is set to one of the following values: DISABLED FR1 and the previous PCI-triggered CGI handover failed because of any of the following reasons: An expired T321 timer An empty CGI measurement report

CGI Hit Rate-Based and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility for E-UTRAN

Cells

The CGI Hit Rate-Based Mobility and Manual Configuration-Based Mobility functions can

be triggered on E-UTRAN cells if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- For IRAT inter-system handover, the value of the PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictTargetSelectMode attribute is set to one of the following values: CGI\_HITRATE\_BASED MANUAL\_BASED CGI\_HITRATE\_MANUAL\_BASED MANUAL\_CGI\_HITRATE\_BASED
- The value of the PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictMobilityEcgiMeas attribute is set to one of the following values: DISABLED ENABLED and the previous PCI-triggered CGI handover failed because of any of the following reasons: An expired T321 timer An empty CGI measurement report

### 3.5.1 CGI Hit Rate-Based Mobility

CGI Hit Rate-Based Mobility function is used when it is not known which cell overlaps

with the current serving cell, or when CGI-capable UEs are available.

The CGI Hit Rate-Based Mobility function can be performed if the following conditions are

fulfilled:

- The value of the PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictTargetSelectMode attribute or the PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictTargetSelectMode attribute is set to one of the following values: CGI\_HITRATE\_BASED CGI\_HITRATE\_MANUAL\_BASED MANUAL\_CGI\_HITRATE\_BASEDNote: This configuration is only applicable when there is no NRCellRelation or EUtranCellRelation MO instance in which the preferredCellManual attribute is set to TRUE.
- There are enough CGI measurement reports for the corresponding PCI cell.

### 3.5.2 Manual Configuration-Based Mobility

The Manual Configuration-Based Mobility function is used when it is known that a

certain target cell fully overlaps with the current serving cell.

The Manual Configuration-Based Mobility function can be triggered if the following

conditions are fulfilled:

- The value of the pciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictTargetSelectMode attribute or the PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictTargetSelectMode attribute is set to one of the following values: MANUAL\_BASED CGI\_HITRATE\_MANUAL\_BASEDNote: This configuration is only applicable when there are not enough CGI measurement reports for the corresponding PCI cell. MANUAL\_CGI\_HITRATE\_BASED
- There is at least one EUtranCellRelation or NRCellRelation MO instance in which the value of the EUtranCellRelation.preferredCellManual or the NRCellRelation.preferredCellManual attribute is set to TRUE. Note: If there are multiple MO instances that fulfill this condition, the first target cell that is found is selected as the mobility target.

## 3.6 PCI Conflict Reporting in EN-DC Deployments

In EN-DC deployments, the PCI Conflict Reporting feature is used to automatically detect

and report if an LTE source cell has cell relations to two or more NR neighbor cells

that have the same PCI and frequency. For more information, see Operational Process for

NR PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting in PCI Conflict Reporting.

# 4 Network Impact of NR PCI Conflict Reporting

The feature allows for fast NR PCI conflict resolution, and therefore, improves

maintenance.

Capacity and Performance

Enabling PCI conflict detection and reporting for the first time can result in

increased load on ENM. This is because of the immediate reporting of PCI

conflict-related MOM attribute value changes and lightweight neighbor object

promotion. It is recommended to enable the function for smaller groups of gNodeBs

separately.

An A3, A5, B1, or B2 measurement report can include a cell that is likely to cause

PCI conflict. This can result in a delay in handover due to the CGI measurement if

the detection of cells likely to cause PCI conflict is enabled.

The handover time to cells in PCI conflict can increase if the NCGI measurement-based

NR intra-system mobility function is enabled. This is because of the additional NCGI

measurements configured by the function.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR PCI Conflict Reporting

## 8.1 PM Events Generated by PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting

The PCI conflict detection and reporting function generates PM events in certain

cases.

When a PCI conflict is detected in an NR cell, the CuCpPciConflictDetectedNr PM event is

triggered. When PCI conflict is detected in an LTE cell, the

CuCpPciConflictDetectedEUtra PM event is triggered. These events are also triggered when

a PCI conflict is resolved, but there is one or more PCI conflict still detected.

When a PCI conflict involving an NR cell is resolved, and the source cell is no longer

detecting any PCI conflict, the CuCpPciConflictResolvedNr PM event is triggered. When a

PCI conflict involving an LTE cell is resolved, and the source cell is no longer

detecting any PCI conflict, the CuCpPciConflictResolvedEUtra PM event is triggered.

PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting in NR Standalone Deployments

## 8.2 DRX Settings for CGI Measurements Triggered by the NR PCI Conflict Reporting Feature

UEs require a DRX reconfiguration to perform the CGI measurements triggered by the NR

PCI Conflict Reporting feature.

The UE needs to be configured with a different DRX profile than the default to schedule

appropriate time to read the SIB1 of the target cell.

The DRX values for NCGI measurements triggered by the NR PCI Conflict Reporting feature

can be configured using the following attributes:

- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDrxInactivityTimer
- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDrxLongCycle
- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDrxOnDurationTimer

The DRX values for ECGI measurements triggered by possible PCI conflict can be configured

using the following attributes:

- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDrxInactivityTimer
- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDrxLongCycle
- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDrxOnDurationTimer

NR PCI Conflict Reporting

## Appendix A.b: 24.Q3.0: PCI Conflict Detection and Reporting with Mitigation Support for NR Intra-System Mobility in NR Standalone

The feature enhancement provides a framework for the NR PCI Conflict Reporting

feature to detect and report cells in PCI conflict in NR standalone deployment. Mitigation

is also provided for NR intra-system mobility scenarios to cells in PCI

conflict.

| Feature Name           | NR PCI Conflict Reporting   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5621                |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node         |
| Access Type            | NR                          |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                    |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following functions:

- The gNodeB can be configured to create automated reports about PCI conflict detection and conflict resolution with neighbor cells. Information on PCI conflict detection and conflict resolution is updated in MO attributes for the affected instances of neighbor cells. Additionally, PM events are generated when a PCI conflict or a PCI conflict resolution is detected. If a lightweight neighbor cell relation object is involved in the PCI conflict, it is automatically promoted to a visible MO instance. If the external cell referenced by the lightweight neighbor cell relation object is also a lightweight neighbor cell relation object, it is promoted as well.
- The gNodeB can be configured to detect cells in the network that are likely to cause PCI conflicts. The detection is based on handover success rates. The gNodeB triggers an NCGI or ECGI measurement procedure and creates cell relation to the detected cell if necessary. Once the cell relation is added, PCI conflict detection is performed.
- The gNodeB can be configured to trigger an NCGI measurement procedure to find the correct target PCell that is in PCI conflict during NR intra-system mobility.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Mobility KPIs might be improved by mitigating PCI conflicts based on the NCGI measurement during NR intra-system mobility.
- PCI conflicts can be identified by using the automated reporting of PCI conflict detection and resolution to neighbor cells.

Capacity and Performance

The gNodeB can trigger an NCGI or ECGI measurement to find the correct target cell

for a handover, therefore, the following mobility KPIs might improve:

- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR-to-LTE Inter-RAT Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR-to-LTE Inter-RAT Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB

For cells that are likely to cause PCI conflict and cells in PCI conflict for

mobility, the gNodeB can trigger NCGI or ECGI measurement procedures. This might

cause the following PM counters introduced by the feature to increase:

- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasEcgiRcvDrxPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasEcgiTriggerDrxPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasNcgiRcvDrxPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasNcgiTriggerDrxPciHandling

Because of the NCGI or ECGI measurement-based handovers, the following PM counters

introduced by the feature enhancement might increase:

- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutIntraGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutIntraGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutIntraGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutIntraGnbPciHandling

With the feature enhancement, the number of the following PM events might increase

because of the NCGI and ECGI measurements triggered by the gNodeB:

- CuCpEcgiMeasurement
- CuCpNcgiMeasurement

When PCI conflict detection and resolution is enabled for the first time, the load on

ENM can increase. This is caused by the changes in the values of MO attributes and

lightweight neighbor cell relation object promotions related to PCI conflict. It is

recommended to enable the function for smaller groups of gNodeBs separately.

In case the originally selected cell for handover is the correct one, the CGI

measurement procedure might cause a slight delay in the handover procedure. This can

be observed as a slight increase of the

NRCellCU.pmRrcConnReestAtt PM counter and a slight decrease

of the following KPIs:

- NR Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR-to-LTE Inter-RAT Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB

Operation

The PCI conflict detection and resolution reporting for neighbor cells can be enabled

by using the PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled

attribute.

The following MO attributes are introduced to notify the operator about the PCI

conflict detection and resolution of neighbor cells:

- ExternalEUtranCell.isPciConflicted
- ExternalEUtranCell.pciConflictDetectingCell
- ExternalEUtranCell.pciConflictedCell
- ExternalNRCellCU.isPciConflicted
- ExternalNRCellCU.pciConflictDetectingCell
- ExternalNRCellCU.pciConflictedCell
- NRCellCU.isPciConflicted
- NRCellCU.pciConflictDetectingCell
- NRCellCU.pciConflictedCell

The following PM events are introduced to observe PCI conflict detection and

resolution:

- CuCpPciConflictDetectedNr
- CuCpPciConflictDetectedEutra
- CuCpPciConflictResolvedNr
- CuCpPciConflictResolvedEUtra

PCI conflicts can be detected through the cell relations to neighbor cells with the

same PCI and frequency. However, PCI conflicts can exist even in the absence of cell

relations. Therefore, the feature enhancement provides a way to detect cells that

are likely to cause PCI conflicts based on the handover execution ratio. For such

cells, the gNodeB triggers the CGI measurement procedure to create a cell relation,

followed by PCI conflict detection.

The feature enhancement can be enabled for NR neighbor cells through the following

attributes:

- PciConflictNR.pciConflictDetectionThreshNr
- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDetectionNcgiMeas
- PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled

The feature enhancement can be enabled for LTE neighbor cells through the following

attributes:

- PciConflictEUtran.pciConflictDetectionThreshLTE
- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDetectionEcgiMeas
- PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled

The following attributes are introduced for DRX configuration for NCGI measurements

in NR:

- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDrxInactivityTimer
- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDrxLongCycle
- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictDrxOnDurationTimer

The following attributes are introduced for DRX configuration for ECGI measurements

in LTE:

- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDrxInactivityTime
- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDrxLongCycle
- PciConflictEUtranUeCfg.pciConflictDrxOnDurationTimer

The following PM counters are introduced to observe when CGI measurements cannot be

initiated because of insufficient UE capabilities:

- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasEcgiFailUeCapPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmUeMeasNcgiFailUeCapPciHandling

With the feature enhancement, the gNodeB can be configured to trigger an NCGI

measurement when handover is triggered to a cell with PCI conflict. The NCGI

measurement is used to determine the correct target cell for the handover. This

function can be enabled through the following attributes:

- PciHandling.pciConflictHandlingEnabled
- PciConflictNRUeCfg.pciConflictMobilityNcgiMeas

The following PM counters are introduced to provide observability to NR intra-system

handover procedures triggered by PCI conflict handling:

- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutIntraGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutIntraGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutIntraGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutInterGnbPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutIntraGnbPciHandling

The following PM counters are introduced to provide observability to IRAT handover

procedures to LTE cells triggered by PCI conflict handling:

- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutEutranPciHandling

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following functionality for operation during

PCI conflict:

- CGI hit rate-based mobility and handover
- Manual configuration-based handover
- Support for ECGI measurement-based handover to LTE

Mobility KPIs can be improved by mitigating PCI conflicts during the following types

of handover procedure:

- IRAT inter-system handover
- NR intra-system handover

Capacity and Performance

Control plane latency during IRAT inter-system Handover can increase. This is because

additional ECGI measurements are triggered for the UE when a B1 or B2 measurement

report is received while the reported cell is in PCI conflict.

With the use of the introduced functions, the following KPIs can improve:

- NR-to-LTE Inter-RAT Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR-to-LTE Inter-RAT Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB

While the ECGI measurements are ongoing, the following integrity KPIs might degrade

because of DRX:

- Average UL MAC UE Throughput
- Filtered MBB UL MAC UE Throughput

With this feature enhancement, ECGI-based measurements are used for a higher portion

of handovers. This can be monitored with the following PM events:

- CuCpEcgiMeasurement Note: The CuCpEcgiMeasurement PM event is triggered at an increased rate when ECGI-based mobility is performed.
- CuCpProcNRHoPrepOut
- CuCpProcNRHoExeOut

When ECGI-based mobility is performed, the following PM counters can increase:

- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepAttOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutEutranPciHandling
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutEutranPciHandling
