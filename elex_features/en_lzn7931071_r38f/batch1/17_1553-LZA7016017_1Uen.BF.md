# 1 Introduction

This document describes the NR Resource and License Use Indicators (RI) for planning

purposes by measuring traffic level and resource use.

RIs are divided into Recommended and Others.

The metrics identified as recommended are most important to monitor network performance.

Metrics classified as others supplement the recommended ones.

RIs are available for the following resource areas:

- Capacity licenses
- System load
- Physical resource use
- Processor load

The RIs are applicable for different NR deployments: NR SA, NR NSA or common to both

deployments.

The RIs are normally applicable to all bands, but since not all counters are applicable

to or supported by all bands, there may be differences. This is not shown in this

document but must be checked in counter documentation.

## 1.1 Aggregation of Resource Indicators

Most of the data indicated by RIs is measured on cell level and with a 15-minute ROP. To

calculate the RI over multiple cells or longer time intervals, the RIs can be aggregated

in the following ways:

- Over a group of cells
- Over a cluster of cells
- Over one RBS
- Over multiple RBSs
- Over a complete geographic area
- Over time periods (hour, day, week)

The following methods used for aggregation contain variants that can produce different

results:

- Aggregate the individual PM counter values across the time and geographic area using the equation: Perform the RI equation: Note: To obtain a metric over a larger area, a longer period or both, operators can replace the individual pmCounter with the aggregating pmCounter.
- Calculate the RI equation for the specific metric at the lower time and geographic resolution with the formula. Aggregate across the longer time and larger geographic area using the equation. When a formula involves the sum of fractions, for example the Σ PI(Cell&amp;ROP), the result of the formula indicates an invalid result when the results are invalid for all fractions involved. When the result is invalid for less than all fractions involved in the formula, then the invalid fractions are ignored. In this case, the value of "N" must be adjusted.
- Do both. The pmCounters can be aggregated over time (hour, day or week) for a specific cell to get a cell-specific, time aggregated RI. Then the cell RI can be aggregated over cell clusters to get an average over a geographic area. Note: This can be forced through the specific data collection tool used.

The consequences of the aggregation choice are the following:

- The use of aggregated pmCounters tend to mask separate cells or times where unusual separate results occurred in a specific period or area. This produces an overall average.
- The use of RI applied to each cell and ROP tends to highlight the effect of individual metrics as each RI is equally weighted. As a consequence, cells with minimal traffic have equal "weight" to cells with large traffic. This gives a bias any final result.
- When the denominator is fixed in every sample for the whole area and time period, then both methods produce the same result.
- When comparing two sets of results, it is important to use the same aggregation methods to avoid any differences caused by the aggregation itself rather than the underlying data.
- Aggregated quantities depending one another changes the meaning of aggregation. In this case SUM function is not appropriate.
- There is no incorrect choice between the two methods, but they are different. Choice can be driven by the data capture tool or through the desired context of use.
- If there is no specific rationale, then the first option (use aggregated pmCounters to aggregate the individual PM counters first) is preferable and slightly simpler.

When creating an aggregated RI from counters reporting a maximum value, the maximum can

be defined as one the following:

- Maximum of maximum
- Average of maximum
- Maximum of average

An alternative is to create a distribution function for the set of max values so that the

range of values can be preserved and highlighted.

## 1.2 RIs using NR Flexible Counters

It can be useful to replace or compensate the RIs, to get a result for a subset of the

UEs or bearers, or a result that excludes certain UEs or bearers. This can be achieved

by using NR Flexible counters. Each gNB counter that is used in an RI has a

corresponding EBS-N counter, and many of these support Flexible counter configuration by

filters.

NR Flexible counters are created in ENM using the EBS-N application, see Manage

Performance NR. There are several filters available, and it is also possible

to combine several filters to get an RI for different subsets of the UEs or bearers.

## 1.3 RIs with Shorter ROP

EBS-N counters can also be used to enable RIs with shorter ROP. If replacing the counters

in the RI formulas with the corresponding EBS-N counters, and if using stream delivery

of RAN Performance event data, the RIs can be created every 5 minute. For more

information, see PM Initiation and Collection in ENM Online Help CPI

Library.

## 1.4 NR Spectral Efficiency Observability

The concept of the physical resource block is not always appropriate and sufficient as a

resource measurement unit. NR features can operate with an assignment of resources that

is not an integer of the PRB. The following resource unit-related concepts are

introduced for NR spectral efficiency and PDCCH use:

- Resource Block Symbol (RBSym)
- RBSym factor
- Resource Block Symbol Expression (RBSE)

RBSym is the basic resource unit. In the frequency domain, it is defined as a common

resource block, while in the time domain, it is a symbol. The RBSym unit is measured in

Hz × sec and is not dependent on numerology and mini-slot. The RBSym factor can be

calculated on the basis of the following formula:

Equation 1   RBSym Factor Calculation

The RBSE is the value of the RBSym expressed in μ. In the frequency

dimension, RBSE is a PRB of a numerology that equals μ. In the time dimension, it

constitutes the symbol duration of a numerology that equals μ. The basic numerology of

the RBSE is μ=4.

Figure 1   RBSym Utilization Example

In a single slot, RBSym can be utilized in the following ways for DL:

- 66 PRBs x 14 symbols = 924 RBSym of total available downlink resources
- 48 RBs x 1 symbol = 48 RBSym used for PDCCH
- 56 RBs x 14 Symbols - 48 RBSym (for PDCCH) = 736 RBSym used for PDSCH
