Summary

NR Multiple TNL Associations feature enables multiple SCTP associations between gNodeB and

AMF.

The feature supports the following configurations:

- Multiple SCTP endpoints on AMF
- Single SCTP endpoint on gNodeB
- SCTP endpoints on AMF and gNodeB can be single-homed or multi-homed.

It also supports the following functionalities:

- Create, remove, and update additional AMF TNL Associations, as ordered by AMF.
- Restrict the type of signaling for each AMF TNL Association, as ordered by AMF.
- Load balance UE associated signaling over multiple AMF TNL Associations (NGAP UE - TNLA binding).

This feature has the following benefits:

- AMF scalability is improved.
- Load distribution of UE-associated signaling on NG-C connection is allowed.

Additional Information

For more information about multiple TNL associations (TNLAs), see the following

documentation:

- 3GPP TS 23.501, System architecture for the 5G System (5GS)
- 3GPP TS 23.502, Procedures for the 5G System (5GS)
- 3GPP TS 38.412, NG signaling transport
- 3GPP TS 38.413, NG Application Protocol (NGAP)

# 2 Dependencies of NR Multiple TNL Associations

This feature has no dependencies to other features, but needs to meet network

requirements.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

This feature has the following limitations:

- Possible NGAP message lost because TNL association fails, such as link break. NGAP protocol does not support message retransmission.
- Possible out-of-order NGAP message delivery when changing the TNL association used for UE-associated signaling. The TNL association can be changed on AMF request, or on TNL association failure.
- Possible out-of-order NGAP message delivery when changing the TNL association used for non-UE associated signaling. The TNL association can be changed on AMF request, or on TNL association failure.

Network Requirements

This feature is only activated on request from AMF, using NGAP signaling. To enable

this function, it requires AMF supporting configuration with multiple SCTP endpoints

on AMF according to 3GPP TS 38.412 and 3GPP TS

23.502

standards.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Multiple TNL Associations

The first TNL association between gNodeB and AMF is always initiated by gNodeB.

Additional TNL associations are created by gNodeB on the request from AMF.

After the NG-C connection is established between gNodeB and AMF, AMF can decide to

establish or remove additional TNL associations for this NG-C connection at any

time.

Up to 32 TNL associations can be established for each AMF. The total number of additional

TNL associations for all AMFs is limited to 192.

Figure 1 shows an example of deployment with a

single SCTP endpoint on gNodeB and multiple SCTP endpoints on AMF.

When multiple operators use a shared node, separate SCTP endpoint on gNodeB can be

configured for each operator, for example, Figure 2.

Figure 1   Multiple TNL Associations between gNodeB and AMF

Figure 2   Multiple TNL Associations between gNodeB and AMF with Shared NR RAN

## 3.1 TNL Association Management

TNL association management is controlled by AMF through NGAP AMF Configuration Update

procedure. The underlying SCTP association establishment is always initiated by

gNodeB.

Figure 3   TNL Association Management

Figure 3 shows the flow for TNL association

management.

1. gNodeB creates new NG-C connection with AMF.
2. Then AMF can decide to add, remove, or update TNL associations for existing NG-C connection at any time. An example trigger for this may be AMF NF scale-out or scale-in. AMF sends AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message with the list of TNL associations to be created, removed, or updated.
3. gNodeB adds, removes, or updates TNL associations, as requested by AMF. If new TNL associations are requested by AMF, gNodeB application waits until all new TNL association attempts are confirmed from lower layers, either as successful or not successful. No reattempt is made if TNL association establishment fails.
4. The list of successfully created TNL associations and the list of TNL associations that failed to be created are included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message and sent to AMF. All information about TNL associations that failed to be created is removed from gNodeB.

## 3.2 TNL Association Usage

AMF defines or changes the usage of a TNL association.

The usage of TNL associations might be restricted by AMF to the following signaling:

- UE-associated signaling only
- Non-UE associated signaling only
- No restriction. Both UE-associated and non-UE associated signaling can be used.

The usage of a TNL association is presented by the

TnlAssociation.usage attribute.

Figure 4   TNL Associations with Different Uses

Multiple TNL associations for each usage type can be established at the same time.

### 3.2.1 NGAP UE-TNLA Binding

If multiple UE-associated TNL associations are established for AMF, gNodeB can balance

the load of connected UEs on these TNL associations.

For each UE, gNodeB randomly selects one of available TNL associations according to TNL

association weight factor (the TnlAssociation.weightFactor attribute)

and usage (the TnlAssociation.usage attribute).

When the TNL association for given UE is selected, all following signaling for that UE

uses the same TNL association. AMF can rebind UE to different TNL association at any

time. gNodeB can rebind UE to different TNL association when the previously used TNL

association is not operational.

### 3.2.2 Non-UE Associated Signaling

gNodeB always uses single TNL association for non-UE associated signaling from gNodeB to

AMF, even if multiple non-UE TNL associations are established. The selected TNL

association is marked by setting the value of the

TnlAssociation.activeForNonUe attribute to true.

The selection of TNL association for non-UE association signaling is automatically done

by gNodeB and cannot be controlled by operator. TNL association weight factor and usage

are considered during the selection.

The following messages are excluded from the previous rule:

- NGAP ERROR INDICATION
- NGAP RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
- NGAP AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLELDGE

These messages are sent on the same TNL association on which the corresponding

request message was received from AMF.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Multiple TNL Associations

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

For detailed information about the PM events, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral

Document.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
