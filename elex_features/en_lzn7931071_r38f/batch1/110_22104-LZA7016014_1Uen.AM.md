Summary

Bridging allows two or more communication networks, or two or more network segments, to create

an aggregate network. A network bridge is a network device that connects multiple

network segments. Bridge behavior is defined by IEEE 802.1Q.

Ethernet bridging allows operators to save IP addresses. Ethernet bridging can also add new

site equipment without impact on the network IP address planning.

# 3 Feature Operation of Ethernet Switching

This feature allows MAC interfaces to communicate using bridges across network

segments.

A bridge connects two or more network segments and creates an aggregate network. Ethernet

frames are forwarded by the bridge between the segments. This allows communication

between MAC interfaces on the different segments. In a non-bridged configuration, the

segments are separate IP subnets and traffic must be routed between the network segments

to enable communication.

Bridging in the transport network is based on EVC. A bridge in the transport network creates

a single broadcast domain by connecting two or more network segments with each other. The

network segments consist of VLAN tagged traffic with a specific VLAN ID on an ethernet

segment. Different VLAN IDs can be used on the different segments, and the bridge is

responsible for retagging the frames. The behavior of the bridge is defined in IEEE

802.1Q.

A bridge can be configured with low latency switching capability, which provides basic

ethernet switch functionality with port-to-port latency that has a lower delay than ordinary

switching.

The bridge maintains a MAC table. This table provides information to determine when an

ethernet packet on one segment of the VLAN must be bridged to another segment. The bridge

learns on which VLAN and port the different MAC addresses are used, and builds the MAC

forwarding table. This table contains information on the MAC addresses used by stations on the

different segments. Whenever an ethernet frame is sent on one of the VLANs, the bridge

forwards it to the VLAN that contains the station with a matching destination MAC address. If

the location of the station is not found in the MAC forwarding table, the packet is flooded.

This means that the packet is sent out on all VLANs connected to the bridge except the one

from which it originated. The aging timer for the MAC forwarding table is five minutes. When a

MAC address has not been seen on the VLAN for this time, it is removed from the table.

When troubleshooting bridging, the show command can be used to display the

MAC forwarding table, or to clear the entire table or entries associated with a port and

VLAN.

# 4 Network Impact of Ethernet Switching

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

# 5 Parameters for Ethernet Switching

This feature introduces parameters related to bridging.

Connectivity.

# 6 Performance of Ethernet Switching

This feature has no directly associated KPIs, counters or events, but some traffic

counters are affected.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters. However, the VlanPort

MO class implements a set of traffic counters for ingress and egress of different types,

which are affected by this feature.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
