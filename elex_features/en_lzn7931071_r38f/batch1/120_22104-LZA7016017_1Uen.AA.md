Summary

The feature introduces the possibility of triggering the EPS Fallback procedure at

session setup. This allows the UE to continue the voice call in LTE without being

released. The feature supports the EPS Fallback procedure for UEs that do not

support VoNR to continue the voice call. The feature introduces a configuration to

control the activation of the EPS Fallback procedure during PDU session setup with

included 5QI=1 flow. The configuration affects non-emergency and emergency voice

calls.

Additional Information

For more information on the EPS Fallback procedure, see 3GPP TS 23.502; 5G;

Procedures for the 5G System (5GS).

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

If there is no existing PDU session when the 5QI=1 flow is received, only the Blind

Release with Redirect is supported as EPS fallback procedure.

Network Requirements

The feature relies on the 5GC as the QoS flow is requested with 5QI=1.

# 3 Feature Operation of Fallback Handling at Session Setup

The feature supports the activation of the EPS Fallback procedure during PDU session

setup with included 5QI=1 flow.

The feature aims to provide the possibility of performing the EPS Fallback procedure at

session setup for the UE to continue the voice call without being released.

The feature supports UEs that do not support VoNR. If the UE supports VoNR, the voice

call might continue in VoNR.

The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup attribute is used to

enable the EPS Fallback procedure at PDU session setup.

The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup attribute can trigger the

EPS Fallback procedure when the gNodeB receives the NGAP PDU SESSION SETUP

REQUEST or NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message for the

5QI=1 flow.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Process

1. The AMF sends the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST or the NGAP INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message for the 5QI=1 flow to set up a PDU session. This happens when, for example, the UE starts to lose Wi-Fi coverage during a voice call and requests the 5GC to continue the conversation through VoNR. If the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup attribute is set to INACTIVE, the gNodeB cannot proceed with the EPS Fallback procedure. The PDU Session Setup procedure with the 5QI=1 flow continues. If the McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup attribute is set to ACTIVE, it is possible to perform an EPS Fallback procedure at session setup.
2. The gNodeB checks the type of the voice call. The handling of the EPS fallback triggered at session setup depends on the configuration of the following features: EPS Fallback for IMS Voice feature for non-emergency voice calls. NR Emergency Fallback to LTE feature for emergency voice calls. For more information, see EPS Fallback for IMS Voice and NR Emergency Fallback to LTE.

# 4 Network Impact of Fallback Handling at Session Setup

Network capacity might be affected as a result of UE

handover.

Capacity and Performance

The handover to LTE can result in reduced network capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Fallback Handling at Session Setup

The feature introduces a MOM parameter to enable the EPS fallback operation at PDU

session setup.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                                | Type       | Description          |
|------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Fallback Handling at Session Setup

The feature has no impact on KPIs, counters, or

events.

KPIs

No impact.

Counters

No impact.

Events

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Fallback Handling at Session Setup

## 8.1 Enable Fallback Handling at Session Setup

The feature must be enabled manually and its operation depends on the configuration

of the EPS Fallback for IMS Voice and the NR Emergency Fallback to LTE features.

Prerequisites

The handling of the EPS fallback triggered at session setup depends on the

configuration of the following features:

- EPS Fallback for IMS Voice for non-emergency voice calls
- NR Emergency Fallback to LTE for emergency voice calls

Steps

1. Set the attribute to ACTIVE to enable the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature.

## 8.2 Disable Fallback Handling at Session Setup

The feature must be disabled manually.

Steps

1. Set the attribute to INACTIVE to disable the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature.

# 9 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 9.1 22.Q4: UE Group Adaptation for Voice Fallback at Session Setup in NR SA

This feature enhancement introduces support for UE group differentiated configuration

of the EPS Fallback procedure in the Fallback Handling at Session Setup feature.

| Feature Name           | Fallback Handling at Session Setup   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5374                         |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                      |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                         |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                  |
| Access Type            | NR                                   |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                            |

Summary and Benefits

The UE

group adaptation is introduced through the new

McfbCellProfileUeCfg MO class. The attributes in the existing

MO class are deprecated and replaced by the corresponding attributes in the new MO

class.

The UE group differentiated configuration of the EPS

Fallback

is

license-controlled

through the User- and

Service-Specific

Mobility feature.

Capacity and Performance

By using the flexible counter framework for EBS counters, operators can define

differentiated counters for different UE groups. Events can be

defined

by using UE group identifiers as separate flexible counter filtering attributes. For

more information, see UE Grouping Framework.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFbAtSessionSetup

attribute and deprecates the

McfbCellProfile.epsFbAtSessionSetup

attribute.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.
