Summary

The EN-DC RAN Slicing feature extends QoS differentiation and dynamically sharing spectral

resources to be applicable to EN-DC traffic.

This feature enables the following feature to support EN-DC traffic:

- NR Radio Resource Partitioning (FAJ 121 5337)
- RAN Slicing Framework (FAJ 121 5095)
- Priority-Controlled Scheduling (FAJ 121 5192)
- NR Relative Priority Scheduling (FAJ 121 5293)

With EN-DC slicing, the slice QoS framework is extended to provide the handling of EN-DC UEs

for the related features. When this feature is activated along with other features

such as NR Radio Resource Partitioning or RAN Slicing, EN-DC traffic is enabled to

be applicable for the features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature does not support changing SPID information using the Master Node

initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure.

The feature is only applicable to Low-Band and Mid-Band.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of EN-DC RAN Slicing

The feature enables SPID, along with PLMN, as a classifier for traffic with EN-DC

characteristics for customized QoS and resource partitioning.

SPID together with PLMN and S-NSSAI is used as a classifier in the slicing framework to

differentiate traffic with NR SA or EN-DC characteristics. Traffic with EN-DC

characteristics can have their own resource partitions with different QoS settings and

resource allocation policies.

The SPID information is propagated from the Core Network to the eNodeB.

SPID information is transferred from the eNodeB to the gNodeB over the X2 interface using

the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message at the Secondary Node Addition

procedure. The gNodeB uses the SPID information internally for traffic mapping by the

slicing framework.

To enable the handling of EN-DC traffic with SPID values, set

ResourcePartitionMember.trafficCategory to

EN-DC.

The feature also enables the matching of UEs based on SPID information. This is

configured by setting the ResourcePartitionMember.spidRfspList

parameter to the applicable value. If left empty, it matches all UEs that have the same

PLMN with ResourcePartitionMember.pLMNList.

# 4 Network Impact of EN-DC RAN Slicing

The feature enables EN-DC support for the related features.

Capacity and Performance

When this feature is activated along with the other features for customized QoS and

resource partitioning, EN-DC traffic is enabled for the applicable features.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Summary

and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides the following

benefits:

- It increases flexibility in RRP and QoS.
- It provides the possibility to control the inheritance of prioritized resources in RRP.
- It prevents traffic starvation in unmapped cell partitions.
- It increases configuration options for meeting expected performance.
- It decreases the configuration complexity for traffic that is prioritized in all cell partitions.

Capacity

and Performance

NR RRP services and traffic types configured at lower

prioritiy

can decrease in capacity.

Operation

This feature enhancement deprecates the

PartitionMapping.resourcePartitionRef attribute. The

deprecated attribute is replaced by the introduced

PartitionMapping.listResourcePartitionRef attribute.
