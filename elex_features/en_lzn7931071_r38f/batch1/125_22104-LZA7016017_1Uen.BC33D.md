# 1 Modulation-Aware Power Control Overview

The feature improves downlink signal quality by reducing EVM. The feature backs off

power from the PDSCH when it is scheduled with 256-QAM modulation.

Summary

The feature backs off power from the PDSCH to reduce EVM when power amplifiers run at

a power level that is close to or at maximum power. The power backoff avoids

clipping and reduces EVM, which results in higher throughput.

When the feature is activated, a power backoff value is determined by the radio unit.

That value is applied when 256-QAM modulation is scheduled for a UE.

Peak throughput results show gains when backoff is used at a power level that is

close to or at maximum power in ideal radio frequency conditions.

Radio reporting is valid on Massive MIMO radio units and some Remote radio units with external

antenna. For other cases, a generic backoff value is determined by the Baseband

Radio Node.

In ESS deployments, the scheduler considers the traffic load for LTE and NR cells.

The feature improves throughput for high SINR users when power and traffic are close

to or at maximum levels. The scheduler continues to guide power backoff if one of

the partner cells in the ESS configuration is locked or deactivated.

# 2 Dependencies of Modulation-Aware Power Control

The feature has dependencies to other features that have an impact on the

configuration and the coverage of NR downlink data and power control.

Hardware

The feature is not supported on the following hardware units:

- Radio Gateway
- LC-05 9xCPRI line card in conversion mode

Limitations

The UE must support 256-QAM in downlink. This limitation applies to all radio

segments.

Radio reporting is valid on the following Remote radio units:

- Radio 4485
- Radio 4486
- Radio 4490
- Radio 4490HP
- Radio 4494
- Radio 4823
- Radio 4890HP

The modulation-aware scheduler function of this feature has the best performance with

only one NR carrier on a Power Amplifier (PA). With mixed-mode carriers on the same

PA, even if full power is used, it is recommended to turn off this function in

low-load cases where power backoff is not necessary.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Modulation-Aware Power Control

The Modulation-Aware Power Control feature calculates and applies a power backoff value

based on the cell configuration.

Power backoff is applied only if the NRSectorCarrier.powerBackoffMode

attribute is set to AUTO or STATIC. This attribute is

set to AUTO by default.

## 3.1 Operational Process for Remote radio units

Remote radio units apply a power backoff value defined by the scheduler, except

when radio reporting is valid.

When radio reporting is valid, the Modulation-Aware Power Control feature is enabled by

default. Power backoff adjustment based on EVM is enabled by default and can be disabled

by setting the NRSectorCarrier.radioReportControlled attribute to

false. In this case, a generic backoff value is determined by the

Baseband Radio Node if the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed

attribute is set to true.

When radio reporting is not valid, the Modulation-Aware Power Control feature is disabled

by default. The feature can be enabled with a generic backoff value by setting the

NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute to

true.

For more information on enabling or disabling the feature, see Enable or Disable Modulation-Aware Power Control.

1. The radio unit calculates the backoff value for each radio variant based on the configuration of the radio unit.
2. If radio reporting is valid, the scheduler selects a backoff value based on EVM information if the NRSectorCarrier.radioReportControlled attribute is set to true. If radio reporting is not valid, or the NRSectorCarrier.radioReportControlled attribute is set to false, the scheduler checks the configuration of the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute. If the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute is set to true, a generic backoff value is selected. If the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute is set to false, no backoff value is selected. If the NRSectorCarrier.powerBackoffMode attribute is set to AUTO and the requirements for bandwidth allocations are met, the scheduler selects the corresponding backoff value based on user SINR. If the NRSectorCarrier.powerBackoffMode attribute is set to STATIC, the scheduler skips the bandwidth allocations check and selects the corresponding backoff value based on user SINR.
3. The selected power backoff value is sent to the physical layer.
4. The backoff value is applied against the gain value and sent to the radio unit.

## 3.2 Operational Process for Massive MIMO Radio Units

Massive MIMO radio units determine and apply a power backoff value when 256-QAM modulation

is scheduled for a UE.

The Modulation-Aware Power Control feature is enabled by default.

For more information on enabling or disabling the feature, see Enable or Disable Modulation-Aware Power Control.

1. The Baseband Radio Node calculates the different backoff value for each radio variant based on the configuration of the Baseband Radio Node. In mixed mode configuration, backoff is only applied on the gNodeB. Note: Backoff is optimized in multi-carrier deployments for radios that support large IBW.
2. The scheduler stores the backoff value sent by the Baseband Radio Node and checks the following requirements: The NRSectorCarrier.backoffMode attribute must be set to AUTO or STATIC. The UE is scheduled with 256-QAM modulation scheme. The UE is close to full bandwidth allocated in the TTI only when the NRSectorCarrier.powerBackoffMode MO attribute is set to AUTO. When the NRSectorCarrier.powerBackoffMode attribute is set to STATIC, the scheduler skips the bandwidth allocations check. Note: Additional backoff is applied for 4-layer codebook-based SU-MIMO transmissions. The use of the backoffOffset MO attribute is optional and the default value is 0.
3. If the requirements are met, the calculated backoff value is sent to the physical layer.
4. The backoff value is applied against the gain value and sent to the radio unit.

# 4 Network Impact of Modulation-Aware Power Control

The feature improves 256-QAM downlink throughput when the radio unit is close to or

at maximum power.

Capacity and Performance

256-QAM downlink throughput is improved for radios configured to operate close to or

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## 7.1 Enable or Disable Modulation-Aware Power Control

The feature can be enabled or disabled by setting the value of the

NRSectorCarrier.powerBackoffMode attribute.

Figure 1   Feature Activation

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Modulation-Aware Power Control

A specific configuration is recommended in ESS deployments when radio reporting is

not valid.

In ESS deployments, if radio reporting is valid, it is recommended to use the default

configuration of MOM attributes. If radio reporting is not valid, the following

configuration is recommended:

- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute must be set to true on the NR cell.
- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.radioReportControlled attribute must be set to false on the NR cell.
- The value of the SectorCarrier.ltePowerBackoffMode attribute must be set to STATIC on the LTE cell.

## Appendix A.c: 23.Q2: NR EVM-Aware Scheduler Support

This feature enhancement provides a

dynamic power backoff functionality to improve Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for radios

operating at full power.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                         |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides a dynamic power backoff functionality. The power

backoff can be changed per TTI based on UE SINR in NR.

This feature enhancement brings higher throughput due to improved EVM at full

power.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement brings throughput improvement. The scheduler can order less

than the default full output power per PRB for users when the resulting lower output

power and better EVM together provide improved performance.

Operation

This feature enhancement is OFF by default. This feature enhancement introduces the

attribute NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed and can be enabled

by setting it to ON.

For cases of radio mixed mode on the same PA, the backoff value might be insufficient

for radio and excessive for some users due to absence of coordination between

schedulers. Therefore, it is recommended to keep off this feature enhancement if the

traffic load is always low even if the full transmitted power is used. Operators can

turn it on with the MOM attribute when the traffic load of all carriers is high.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature has the following hardware limitations:

- This feature enhancement is supported on non-AAS-capable radios (excluding the RDS and high-band radios).
- Only CPRI is supported. This feature enhancement cannot be enabled for Radio Gateway and LC-05 9xCPRI with MOM attributes.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 23.2 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.

Summary and Benefits

The scheduler considers EVM and transmitted output power to guide power backoff and

decide how to schedule on ESS carriers.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Data throughput is improved.
- The scheduler considers the traffic load for LTE and NR cells in the ESS deployment.
- The scheduler continues to guide power backoff if one of the partner cells is locked or deactivated.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement improves throughput in ESS deployments for high SINR users

when power and traffic are close to or at maximum levels.

Existing PM counters can be used to measure the functionality of the feature

enhancement. Existing KPIs representing downlink throughput can be used to observe

the performance of the feature enhancement.

Operation

In ESS deployments, if radio reporting is valid, it is recommended to use the default

configuration of MOM attributes. If radio reporting is not valid, the following

configuration is recommended:

- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.bbOnlyBackoffAllowed attribute must be set to true on the NR cell.
- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.radioReportControlled attribute must be set to false on the NR cell.
- The value of the SectorCarrier.ltePowerBackoffMode attribute must be set to STATIC on the LTE cell.
