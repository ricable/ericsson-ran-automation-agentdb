Summary

An NTP reference provides frequency synchronization service to a node.

The NTP reference uses the NTP protocol over the IP backhaul towards an NTP server.

NTP provides the frequency accuracy required by 3GPP.

Additional Information

For more information about this feature and related topics, see the following

documentation:

- Manage Network Synchronization
- Network Synchronization
- Timing and synchronization aspects in packet networks, ITU-T G.8261
- Network Time Protocol Version 4, IETF RFC 5905

# 2 Dependencies of Clock Source over NTP

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement is expected for this feature

Limitations

An RBS can be connected to maximum eight NTP servers over an IP network. It is

recommended to use minimum two NTP servers.

An NTP server based on a commercial computer platform does not provide the accuracy

required by 3GPP. Contact Ericsson for advice on NTP servers.

Network Requirements

This feature requires that the NTP client has IP connectivity towards an NTP server

located in the transport network.

The NTP reference can be used for frequency synchronization, if the following

transport network requirements are fulfilled:

- Roundtrip delay for NTP packets must be less than 1 s.
- Packet Delay Variation for NTP packets must be less than 10 ms.
- NTP server must support 10 NTP requests per second per client.

It is highly recommended to implement QoS policies in the backhaul to process the NTP

or PTP packets with the highest priority.

# 3 Feature Operation

Operational Process

Clock Source over NTP is a network synchronization feature where the RBS locks its

clock to an NTP server that is connected over an IP network.

The NTP server and RBS generate a series of timestamps, as described in the

following stages:

1. The RBS sends NTP requests periodically to the NTP server. Every NTP request contains the Originate Timestamp that defines the time the NTP request was generated.
2. The NTP server timestamps the reception of NTP request messages with the Receive Timestamp, and transmission of the NTP response messages with the Transmit Timestamp. The NTP response message contains all three time stamps.
3. The RBS generates a fourth timestamp, Receive Timestamp, when the NTP response message is received. The set of timestamps filtered by using the Differential Time Method algorithm to find a suitable set that the RBS can use to lock its clock.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

A Differential Time Method is based on the time differences between a master NTP

server and slave RBS. The IP packet delay is computed from the time stamps of the

NTP server and the RBS. The RBS calculates the frequency drift of its oscillator

then tunes the RBS clock to the NTP server.

# 4 Network Impact of Clock Source over NTP

No impact is expected from this feature.

Capacity and Performance

Clock Source over NTP has no impact on system behavior and performance, the RBS can

lock the clock for the Uu interface to one of the preselected clock sources.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

# 5 Parameters of Clock Source over NTP

The feature introduces parameters for Baseband Radio Node in the

RadioEquipmentClockReference and the

NtpFrequencySync MO classes.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines

In addition to the timing information described above, the NTP server can also signal

information about the server. The NTP response messages contain stratum level and leap

indicator fields with varying values. Failure is indicated by the following:

- A stratum level different from one indicates that the NTP server is not controlled by a Primary Reference Clock (PRC) or possibly not synchronized at all
- A leap indication equal to three indicates that the server has a failure condition

An NTP server is considered unreliable if either failure condition is present.

The RBS sets up NTP processes for clock generation for the Uu interface towards every

preselected NTP server. The frequency of the NTP requests is 1 to 10 requests per second

towards the NTP server as the RBS attempts to align its clock. The higher request

frequency is used at startup or acquisition to make convergence time shorter and the

rate is decreased when steady state is reached.

The RBS has the NTP process towards preselected alternative NTP servers to evaluate

connectivity and quality to tolerate:

- Loss of connectivity towards the server to which the clock is currently aligned
- Degradation of quality of the server to which the clock is currently aligned

Baseband Radio Node

A precondition to this feature is that suitable InterfaceIPv4 and

AddressIPv4 MO instances are correctly configured.

The NTP reference status can be read out from the

NtpFrequencySync.ntpFrequencySyncStatus attribute.

The IpSyncRef MO class administers the NTP server process,

including the domain name and IP address of the NTP server used as clock source for

the Uu interface, as shown in the following figure:

Figure 2   Configuration of NTP Server Processes

Up to eight instances of IpSyncRef can be configured in an RBS.

The list and priority order of preselected synchronization references is configured

in the Synchronization MO.

The DSCP for NTP IP packets carrying NTP Request messages is configured with

IpAccessHostEt.ntpDscp attribute.

The IpAccessHostEt represents the IP traffic host in the RBS, see

the Transport Network Configuration document for a detailed

description.
