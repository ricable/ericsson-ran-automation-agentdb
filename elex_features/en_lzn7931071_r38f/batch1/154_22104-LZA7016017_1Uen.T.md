Summary

The feature enables the following combination of radio units to be used for one logical cell

in Low-Band:

- Two 2T2R radio units configured as one 4T4R radio unit

The feature enables the following combinations in Mid-Band:

- Two 2T2R radio units configured as one 4T4R radio unit
- Two 4T4R radio units configured as one 8T8R radio unit
- Four 2T2R radio units configured as one 8T8R radio unit

The feature can provide the following benefits by combining the radio units and reducing the

number of cells:

- Reduced number of handovers
- Reduced number of call drops
- Reduced interference between cells
- Simplified cell management

The feature uses deterministic carrier allocation to keep the optimal antenna mapping after a

radio restart or a system upgrade. This helps avoid performance decrease.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Combined Radio

The feature only supports certain types of radios and radio

configurations.

This is because the NR Timing Advance measurements are combined for all TRPs             and the location of the measurement reference point is ambiguous. |

Hardware

The feature has the following hardware dependencies:

- Massive MIMO radio units are not supported.
- The configured radio units must be of the same type.
- The recommended maximum CPRI length difference between two radio units is 5.5 km.

Limitations

The feature does not support ESS.

The NR Combined Radio feature and the LTE Combined Cell feature cannot be used in the

same frequency band within the same RAN Compute unit and the same radio.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Combined Radio

The feature uses different radio placements to ensure the best performance in different

environments and it uses deterministic carrier allocation to keep the optimal antenna

mapping.

## 3.1 Radio Unit Placement

The combined radio units can be placed in different ways to suit different

environments.

The radio units used for the logical cell can be in the same location or in different

locations.

Figure 1   Radio Units in the Same Location

If the two 4T4R radio units that create an 8T8R logical cell are in the same location, the

antenna arrays cast narrow beams that are pointing in the opposite directions. This type of

radio unit placement can be used in tunnels and along railways for example.

Figure 2   Radio Units in Different Locations

If the two 4T4R radio units that create an 8T8R logical cell are in different locations, the

antenna arrays create a flexible cell. This type of radio unit placement can be used in rural

areas for example.

## 3.2 Deterministic Carrier Allocation

The feature uses deterministic carrier allocation to keep the optimal antenna mapping

after a radio restart or a system upgrade.

Deterministic carrier allocation uses attribute settings to allocate specific antenna

branches to carriers. This keeps the optimal antenna mapping after a radio restart or a

system upgrade to help avoid performance decrease.

Deterministic carrier allocation uses the following attributes:

- NRSectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas
- NRSectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas
- NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef
- NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef

For more information about the attribute settings, see Engineering Guidelines for NR Combined Radio.

For more information about the deterministic carrier allocation, see Features for

Radio Configurations in the Ericsson Radio System Hardware library.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Combined Radio

The feature reduces the number of call drops and the interference between

cells.

Capacity and Performance

The feature reduces the number of call drops by reducing the number of handovers. It

also reduces interference between cells by reducing the number of cells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Combined Radio

The feature requires certain parameters to be configured.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                            | Type      | Description                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NRSectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas       | Affecting | These parameters are required to be set to certain values according                                 to the radio unit configuration. |
| NRSectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas       | Affecting | These parameters are required to be set to certain values according                                 to the radio unit configuration. |
| NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef        | Affecting | These parameters are required not to be empty.                                                                                       |
| NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef        | Affecting | These parameters are required not to be empty.                                                                                       |
| NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower | Affecting | The TX power must be configured as the total power of all radios.                                                                    |

# 6 Performance of NR Combined Radio

The feature performance can be observed through the handover counters.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The lower number of handovers can be observed through the handover counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Combined Radio

## 8.1 Attribute Settings for Two 4T4R Radio Units Configured as One 8T8R Radio Unit

Deterministic carrier allocation requires specific attribute settings if two 4T4R

radio units are configured as one 8T8R radio unit. RF branches 1-4 are from the

first radio unit and RF branches 5-8 are from the second radio unit.

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas and NRSectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attributes to 8.
2. Add the RF branch references to the NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef and NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attributes. The RF branch list in the NRSectorCarrier MO overrides the RF branch list in the SectorEquipmentFunction MO in the following order: RfBranch=1 RfBranch=6 RfBranch=5 RfBranch=2 RfBranch=3 RfBranch=8 RfBranch=7 RfBranch=4

## 8.2 Attribute Settings for Two 2T2R Radio Units Configured as One 4T4R Radio Unit

Deterministic carrier allocation requires specific attribute settings if two 2T2R

radio units are configured as one 4T4R radio unit. RF branches 1 and 2 are from the

first radio unit and RF branches 3 and 4 are from the second radio unit.

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas and NRSectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attributes to 4.
2. Add the RF branch references to the NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchRxRef and NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attributes. The RF branch list in the NRSectorCarrier MO overrides the RF branch list in the SectorEquipmentFunction MO in the following order: RfBranch=1 RfBranch=4 RfBranch=3 RfBranch=2

## 8.3 Configuration Check for Radio Gateway and ESS using DCA

For customers the DCA function it is recommended to run script chkDca.mos prior to

upgrade to detect any existing mismatching DCA configurations. The script is included in

an Excel file called Configuration Check for Radio Gateway and ESS, and this Excel file

is included in the Baseband Radio Node ELEX library. The Excel file contains

instructions for how to run the script.
