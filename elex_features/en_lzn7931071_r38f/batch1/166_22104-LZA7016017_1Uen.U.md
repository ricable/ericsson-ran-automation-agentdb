Hardware

This feature is supported on eCPRI-based Massive MIMO radio units, except for AIR

6468.

Limitations

This feature has the following limitations:

- FDD is not supported.
- Shared radio units are not supported.
- Up to two radio links are supported for each radio interface port on a Baseband unit.
- 25.8-Gbps eCPRI is not supported on AIR 3239 and AIR 6454.
- MAC move drop must be disabled in each EVPN bridge connecting multiple radio links to the same unit. For more information on the mac-move-drop command, see CLI Commands in the Ericsson R6000 CPI library.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

This feature identifies the radio unit to be used in the point-to-multipoint

fronthaul network based on the serial number of the radio unit or on custom identities of

network equipment ports connected to the radio unit.

The radio unit is identified in the point-to-multipoint fronthaul network using either

equipment-identity-based radio integration or topology-identity-based radio

integration.

Figure 2   Equipment-Identity-Based Radio Integration Using the Serial Number of the

Radio Unit

The serial number of the radio unit used in the point-to-multipoint fronthaul network is

set as the value of the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute.

Figure 3   Topology-IdentityBbased Radio Integration Using Custom Identities of Network

Equipment Ports Connected to the Radio Unit

The identities of network equipment ports connected to the radio unit to be used in the

point-to-multipoint fronthaul network are specified in the

NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute.

When the identity of a radio unit is set, packets from radio units with a different

identity are dropped.

Figure 4   Point-to-Multipoint Connections

This feature allows the establishment of point-to-point fronthaul networks by connecting

one radio interface port on an eCPRI-based Massive MIMO radio unit to one radio

interface port on a Baseband unit. Equipment-identity-based and topology-identity-based

radio integration in a point-to-point fronthaul network are optional. The radio unit is

identified in the point-to-point fronthaul network based on the identity of the radio

interface port on the Baseband unit.

Figure 5   Point-to-Point Connections

Radio Link Activation

1. The user creates the RiNetwork MO class.
2. The user creates the NetworkIdentity MO class as a child of the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that represents the radio unit to be used in the point-to-multipoint fronthaul network. This step is optional in a point-to-point fronthaul network.
3. The user configures the following attributes based on the radio integration method: For equipment-identity-based radio integration, the serial number of the radio unit is set as the value of the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute. For topology-identity-based radio integration, the custom identities are specified in the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute. Note: For a successful link activation, the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute must match the Interface-ID option values of the router ports connected to the unit represented by the FieldReplaceableUnit MO. For more information, see DHCP in the Ericsson R6000 library. This step is optional in a point-to-point fronthaul network. When both integration methods are configured, the value of the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute is used to identify the radio unit, and the value of the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId is ignored. The following use cases raise alarms: If the user does not configure at least one of the attributes after creating the NetworkIdentity MO class, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised with the No parameters are configured on NetworkIdentity child MO. additional text on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that represents the radio unit. When the user sets the value of the corresponding attribute of the NetworkIdentity MO, the alarm ceases. If the cable of the unit represented by the FieldReplaceableUnit MO is suspected to be connected to a different port than specified in the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute, the MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm is raised with the Value of parameter neighborPortId inconsistent with neighbor port ID values fetched from physical connections towards the unit represented by parent FieldReplaceableUnit MO. Neighbor port ID values are listed in Additional Information. additional text on the NetworkIdentity MO instance.
4. A radio interface port on the Baseband unit is associated with the radio unit. Note: If multiple links exist between a radio interface port and a radio unit, the port is associated with the radio unit only once.
5. The radio link is activated. The following use cases raise alarms: If a radio link cannot be established, the Link Failure alarm is raised with the No signal detected. Port: &lt;LDN for RiPort&gt; additional text. If a radio link fails on either of the associated ports, the Link Failure alarm is raised with the Not in operation. Port: &lt;LDN for RiPort&gt; additional text. The alarm is raised on the RiLink MO instance that represents the radio link. When the radio link is established, the alarm ceases. If the control link cannot be established, the OAM Connection to Unit Failure alarm is raised with the Connection establishment failure additional text. If the control link fails, the OAM Connection to Unit Failure alarm is raised with the Connection lost additional text. The alarm is raised on the FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance that represents the radio unit. When the control link is reestablished, the alarm ceases.
6. The configured paths to the radio unit are activated.

Radio Unit Replacement

1. A radio unit is installed or replaced.
2. The configured paths to the removed radio unit are deactivated.
3. For equipment-identity-based radio integration, the user updates the value of the NetworkIdentity.serialNumber attribute to the serial number of the newly installed radio unit.
4. The configured paths to the newly installed radio unit are activated.

# 4 Network Impact of Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

This feature increases traffic capacity in the fronthaul network.

Capacity and Performance

This feature increases traffic capacity in the fronthaul network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

For topology-identity-based integration, it is required to configure a Lightweight

DHCPv6 Relay Agent with Interface-ID option for each network equipment port

connected to the radio unit.

For more information, see Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent in the

Ericsson R6000 library.

# 5 Parameters for Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

This feature introduces parameters connected to the configuration of radio

integration methods.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                      | Type       | Description          |
|--------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| NetworkIdentity.serialNumber   | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

This feature has no associated KPIs, events, or counters.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Point-to-Multipoint Packet Fronthaul

This feature requires appropriate configuration of the fronthaul

switches.

Avoiding Fronthaul Traffic Overload

This feature does not include traffic limitation capabilities. The network must be

dimensioned to avoid fronthaul traffic overload.

Configuration of the Fronthaul Switches

The fronthaul switches must be configured in the following way:

- To support multiple radio interface ports in an Ethernet VPN bridge
- To support multiple Ethernet connections in one broadcast domain
- To support Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent with the Interface-ID option for topology-identity-based integration for each network equipment port connected to the radio unit

The fronthaul switches must be reconfigured each time the radio link changes.

Avoiding Rollback to Point-to-Point

To avoid rollback to a software version that only supports a point-to-point fronthaul

network, it is recommended to use a rollback upgrade package that supports a

point-to-multipoint fronthaul network.

Configuring Custom Identities for Topology-Identity-Based Radio

Integration

Custom identities for radio units must meet the following requirements:

- Case-sensitive free text using only alphanumerical characters, dashes and underscores.
- Limited to a length of 255 characters.
- Unique in the NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute
- Unique in other NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attributes on the node
- The NetworkIdentity.neighborPortId attribute must match the Interface-ID option values of the router ports connected to the unit represented by the FieldReplaceableUnit MO.

For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.
