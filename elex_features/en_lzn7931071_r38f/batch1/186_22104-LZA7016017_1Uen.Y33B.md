Summary

This feature allows for a trade-off between the different UE groups and optimization of

specific UE groups by introducing UE-group specific configurations and benefits for

the following functions:

| Aperiodic CSI periodicity                                                                           |    | Aperiodic CSI periodicity can be differentiated for each UE group. 								This includes the configuration of aperiodic CSI reporting intensity 								used for downlink cell group switching when no data is transmitted 								on the SCG. This is only applicable for Low-Band and Mid-Band.                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

This feature introduces support for UE group-differentiated user plane configuration

and enhancement for downlink cell group handling.

This feature implements UE grouping in gNodeB-CU-UP and gNodeB-DU to select UE and

DRB-level user-plane configurations.

Different configurations can be applied to the same 5QI for different UEs. In this case,

the following criteria needs to be applied:

- The license is activated.
- Multiple UEs have to be configured with different configurations.

Operational Process

1. At least one UE group definition is configured.
2. At least one non-default MO instance of one or more of the following MO classes is configured: AqmCfg CgSwitchCfg DcDlCfg
3. Optionally, create and configure one or more instances of the L4sCfg MO class.
4. Optionally, create non-default instances of the following MO instances: CgSwitch Drb DrbUp UserPlaneProfile
5. At least one non-base MO instance of one or more of the following MO classes is configured: CgSwitchUeCfg DrbUeCfg DrbUpUeCfg UserPlaneProfileUeCfg Where the target UE group IDs are added to the following parameters of one or more instances of the previous MO classes: prefUeGroupList ueConfGroupList ueGroupList Where references of the following MO classes are set to non-default MO instances: AqmCfg CgSwitchCfg DcDlCfg
6. Optionally, manually set the following attributes: CUUP5qi.drbRef CUUP5qi.l4sCfgRef DrbUeCfg.l4sCfgRef DU5qi.drbUpRef NRCellDU.endcCgSwitchRef NRCellDU.nrdcCgSwitchRef
7. The UE Group Evaluation is performed according to the UE Grouping Framework feature.
8. The gNodeB-CU-UP receives UE group information in the E1AP BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or the E1AP BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message. The gNodeB-DU receives UE group information in the F1AP UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message.
9. The configuration is selected based on the Algorithm for Selection of MO Class Instances Based on UE Groups process. For more information, see UE Grouping Framework. For the CgSwitchUeCfg, DrbUeCfg, and DrbUpUeCfg MO classes, the configuration is defined in the MO instances referenced by the following reference attributes: CgSwitchUeCfg.cgSwitchCfgRef DrbUeCfg.aqmCfgRef DrbUeCfg.dcDlCfgRef DrbUpUeCfg.aqmCfgRef
10. The configuration is applied to the UE or the DRB.

## 3.1 Automatic Setting of Reference Attributes

Some MO instances are automatically created, and their reference attributes are

automatically set.

Default Configuration for gNodeB-CU-UP

The following instances are automatically created:

- AqmCfg=Default\_application\_signaling
- AqmCfg=Default\_conversational\_media
- AqmCfg=Default\_other
- DcDlCfg=Default
- Drb=Default\_application\_signaling
- Drb=Default\_conversational\_media
- Drb=Default\_other
- DrbUeCfg=Base
- DrbUeCfg=Base
- DrbUeCfg=Base
- UserPlaneProfile=Default
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg=Base

The reference attributes are automatically set for the following 5QIs, if the

CUUP5qi.drbRef attribute is not manually set:

- The Default\_application\_signaling parameter 5QI is set for 5 or 69.
- The Default\_conversational\_media parameter 5QI is set for 1, 65 or 66.
- The Default\_other parameter 5QI is set for all other 5QIs.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the default values of the

automatically created instances.

Figure 1   Default Values under the UserPlaneProfile MO

Class

Figure 2   Default Values under the CUUP5qi MO Class

Unless configured manually, the DrbUeCfg.aqmCfgRef attribute is

automatically set to the AqmCfg instance that has the same RDN as

the parent Drb instance, if the RDN corresponds to one of the

automatically created instances.

For any other RDN that is not in the automatically created list, the

DrbUeCfg.aqmCfgRef attribute is set to

AqmCfg=Default\_other configuration.

Unless configured manually, the DrbUeCfg.dcDlCfgRef attribute is

set to DcDlCfg = Default.

Default Configuration for gNodeB-DU

The following instances are automatically created:

- AqmCfg=Default\_application\_signaling
- AqmCfg=Default\_conversational\_media
- AqmCfg=Default\_other
- CgSwitch=Default
- CgSwitchUeCfg=Base
- CgSwitchCfg=Default
- DrbUp=Default\_application\_signaling
- DrbUp=Default\_conversational\_media
- DrbUp=Default\_other
- DrbUpUeCfg=Base
- DrbUpUeCfg=Base
- DrbUpUeCfg=Base

The reference attributes are automatically set for the following 5QIs, if the

DU5qi.drbUpRef attribute is not manually set:

- The Default\_application\_signaling parameter 5QI is set for 5 or 69.
- The Default\_conversational\_media parameter 5QI is set for 1, 65 or 66.
- The Default\_other parameter 5QI is set for all other 5QIs.

Figure 3 shows the default values of the

automatically created instances under the DU5qi MO class.

Unless configured manually, the DrbUpUeCfg.aqmCfgRef attribute is

automatically set to the AqmCfg instance that has the same RDN as

the parent Drb instance, if the RDN corresponds to one of the

automatically created instances.

For any other RDN that is not in the automatically created list, the

DrbUpUeCfg.aqmCfgRef attribute is set to

AqmCfg=Default\_other configuration.

When deprecation handling is disabled by setting the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute to

false,

reference

attributes listed in Table 2 are automatically set, unless they

are manually set to refer to another MO instance.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

This feature reduces aperiodic CSI load and UE battery consumption.

Capacity and Performance

Offloading MCG cells by disabling MCG usage for specific UE groups can be observed

through lower PRB utilization on MCG cells.

Throughput can be improved for the benchmark UE group through increased AQM

thresholds without increasing latency for other UE groups.

Responsiveness of the switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the

Secondary Node terminated split DRB is increased for specific UE groups. This is due

to a reaction to radio resource condition changes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

## 9.1 Differentiated Configuration for Different Service UE Groups

It is possible to trade off different characteristics by using UE grouping. The following

algorithm for MO class instance selection based on UE groups selection criteria can be

used to differentiate the UE groups:

1. Create the UE grouping selection profiles using the UeServiceGroupDefinition MO class and set the selection criteria using, for example, the following variables: &lt;5qi&gt; &lt;imeisv&gt; &lt;qci&gt;
2. Configure at least one non-default MO instance of one or more of the following MO classes: AqmCfg CgSwitchCfg DcDlCfg
3. Optionally, create and configure one or more instance of the L4sCfg MO class.
4. Optionally, create non-default instances of the following MO instances: CgSwitch Drb DrbUp UserPlaneProfile
5. Create at least one non-base MO instance of one or more of the following MO classes: CgSwitchUeCfg DrbUeCfg DrbUpUeCfg UserPlaneProfileUeCfg Where the target UE group IDs are added to the following parameters of one or more instances of the previous MO classes: prefUeGroupList ueConfGroupList UeGroupList Where references of the following MO classes are set to non-default MO instances: AqmCfg CgSwitchCfg DcDlCfg L4sCfg

## 9.2 SCG Offloading for Improved Benchmarking Performance

The performance of a benchmarking UE can benefit from offloading ordinary traffic from

the SCG. The UE group with ordinary traffic is configured by setting the

UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpPreferredCg attribute to

MCG. The UE group with benchmarking UEs is configured by setting

the UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpPreferredCg attribute to

SCG.

It is recommended to keep the DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed attribute set to

ON for both UE groups, as UEs with high traffic need can still use

both MCG and SCG.

## 9.3 Differentiated AQM Thresholds for Optimized Benchmarking Performance

UE group-differentiated AQM thresholds can be used to support an ordinary UE group for

MBB-type traffic optimized for both latency and throughput, simultaneously with a

benchmarking UE group optimized for peak throughput.

The UE group with ordinary UEs is configured with the recommended values for the

AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT attribute for both DU and CU-UP.

The UE group for benchmarking is configured with higher values than recommended for the

AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT attribute for both DU and CU-UP.

## 9.4 UE Group-Differentiated Aperiodic CSI Periodicity

The tradeoff between the following two conditions can be optimized between UE groups on

Low-Band and Mid-Band:

- The need for responsiveness of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources switching and its resource usage for polling for estimated downlink radio quality
- The corresponding UE battery consumption

The UE group with ordinary UEs is configured with recommended aperiodic CSI periodicity

by using the CgSwitchCfg.dlScgNoDataAcsiPeriodicity attribute.

A UE group with selected UEs for fast responsiveness of downlink MCG and SCG radio

resources switching is configured with a lower value for aperiodic CSI periodicity using

theCgSwitchCfg.dlScgNoDataAcsiPeriodicity attribute.

Semi-stationary UEs or UEs with low requirements on latency can be configured with a

longer aperiodic CSI periodicity by using the

CgSwitchCfg.dlScgNoDataAcsiPeriodicity attribute. They can be

disabled by the switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources by using the

CgSwitchCfg.dlCgSwitchMode attribute set to

false.

## 9.5 Deprecation Handling

The following attributes are introduced for deprecation handling:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled

The GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled and the

GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attributes control

whether the legacy or the updated MOM configuration is used.

If the following attributes are set to false, legacy attributes are used

with deprecation handling:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled

If the following attributes are set to true, the introduced MOM

configuration is used:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled

Node restart is required after both changes.

Backwards Compatible Changes

For backwards compatibility, the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is used and

by default it is set to true.

All deprecated attribute values are copied from the NRCellDU MO

instances to the replacement attributes in the CgSwitchCfg MO

instances.

When normal deprecation handling is enabled, the MO instance of the introduced MO

class corresponding to the NRCellDU MO instance is automatically

deleted or created.

When normal deprecation handling is enabled, and the operator creates an

NRCellDU MO instance, instances of the following MO classes

must not be created manually:

- CgSwitch
- CgSwitchCfg
- CgSwitchUeCfg
- UeCC

If the operator wants to create instances of these MO classes together with

NRCellDU MO instances in the same transaction, the creation

of the NRCellDU MO instance must be ordered after the creation of

the listed MO classes.

Normal deprecation handling only works for NRCellDU MO instances

that are mapped to one CgSwitch MO instance, and if the number of

CgSwitch MO instances is at most 48. When an

NRCellDU MO instance is created, but there is no

CgSwitch MO instance left, deprecation handling is not

applied for that cell. Therefore, default values are used instead for the following

attributes:

- NRCellDU.endcDlLegSwitchEnabled
- NRCellDU.endcDlNrLowQualThresh
- NRCellDU.endcDlNrQualHyst

It is possible to control which configuration to use for each

NRCellDU instance by setting the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute to

false, even when more than 48 NRCellDU MO

instances are created. There is still a limitation of having 48 plus one

CgSwitch MO instances for configuration. Additionally, UE

grouping is only supported when the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to

false.

Figure 5 shows normal deprecation

handling.

Figure 5   Normal Deprecation Handling

It is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in the

CgSwitchCfg MO class if the class is available in the

Management System.

It is recommended to update the attribute values in the introduced MO classes first,

when deprecation handling is disabled and the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to

false.

Disabling deprecation handling prevents attributes in the

CgSwitchCfg MO instance from being overwritten in the

introduced management system versions. In these use cases, the

CgSwitchCfg MO instance is visible and used instead of the

deprecated attributes.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes

Changes in the following MO classes are non-backwards compatible because of the

reduced cardinality of the introduced MO classes:

- AqmCfg
- DcDlCfg
- Drb
- DrbUeCfg
- UserPlaneProfile
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg

Therefore, it is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in these MO

classes if they are available in the Management System.

If the change to the introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the

deprecation window ends, default values are applied if no configuration is

provided.

Figure 6 and Figure 7 show alternative deprecation

handling, when the altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute is set

to true.

Figure 6   Alternative Deprecation Handling in

GNBCUUPFunction

Figure 7   Alternative Deprecation Handling in

GNBDUFunction

It is recommended to migrate as soon as possible to the introduced attributes to

fully realize the benefits of the new configuration management for this feature, and

avoid using the following attributes:

- CUUP5qi.aqmMode
- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrPrioCg

- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ueConfGroupList
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ulPdcpScgRetProhibitTime

If the GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute is set

to false, the following attributes are used:

- DU5qi.aqmMode
- DU5qi.estimatedE2ERTT
- DU5qi.packetDelayBudget
- DU5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset

If the GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute is set

to true, the following attributes are used:

- AqmCfg.aqmMode
- AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT
- AqmCfg.tDiscardDl
- DrbUp.ueConfGroupType
- DrbUpUeCfg.aqmCfgRef
- DrbUpUeCfg.prefUeGroupList
- DrbUpUeCfg.ueConfGroupList
- DrbUpUeCfg.ueGroupList
- DU5qi.drbUpRef

If the switch to the introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the

deprecation window ends and no configuration is provided, the default values are

used for these attributes.

## 9.6 Migration Information

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces attributes and MO

classes for UE group-differentiated user plane configuration, for downlink cell group

switching, and for AQM.

MO classes and attributes are introduced under the GNBCUUPFunction and

the GNBDUFunction MO classes to support the introduced

functionalities. These classes and attributes co-exist with deprecated attributes.

Therefore, the migration to the introduced attributes is recommended.

Guidelines for Migration from the GNBCUUPFunction MO Class to

the UserPlaneProfile MO Class

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- There is a single instance of the UserPlaneProfile MO class.
- The attribute values defined under the UserPlaneProfileUeCfg=Base MO instance are applied to all 5QIs and QCIs.

Table 5   Mapping between Legacy and Introduced Attributes under the

GNBCUUPFunction MO Class

| Legacy Attribute                       | Introduced Attribute                           |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlAggActTime         | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggActTime           |
| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlAggExpiryTimer     | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggExpiryTimer       |
| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlPdcpInitialMcgRate | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpMcgInitialRate     |
| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlPdcpInitialScgRate | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpScgInitialRate     |
| GNBCUUPFunction.dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeLTE | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpMcgSpsTargetTime   |
| GNBCUUPFunction.dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeNR  | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpScgSpsTargetTime   |
| GNBCUUPFunction.endcDlNrRetProhibTimer | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpScgRetProhibitTime |

Guidelines for Migration from the CUUP5qi MO Class to the

Drb and the UserPlaneProfile MO

Classes

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- The CUUP5qi.drbRef attribute must reference a Drb MO instance.
- The DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance and a DcDlCfg MO instance.
- Two or more CUUP5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single Drb MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances being used for such CUUP5qi MO instances.
- Different Drb instances with a child DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM and PDCP settings. This results in different AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances.
- Automatically created Drb MO instances can be referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance.
- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DcDlCfg DrbUeCfg
- Manually created instances of L4sCfg MO class can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi instance.

Guidelines for Migration from the DU5qi MO Class to the

DrbUp MO Class

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- The DU5qi.drbUpRef attribute must reference a DrbUp MO instance.
- The DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance.
- Two or more DU5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single DrbUp MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg MO instance being used for any DU5qi MO instances.
- Different DrbUp MO instances with a child DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM settings. Different AqmCfg MO instances are needed.
- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by any DU5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DrbUp DrbUpUeCfg
