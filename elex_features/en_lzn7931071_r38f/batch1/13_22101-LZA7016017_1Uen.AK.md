| Value Package Identity   | FAJ 801 4017   |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Introduced in            | N20.Q3         |

# 2 Benefits of Voice over NR

The Voice over NR value package enables the setup of multiple DRBs in a PDU session. It

also supports the PDU Session Modification procedure that is necessary for voice over NR

services.

The function included in the value package supports VoNR calls. This allows the handling

of voice traffic directly in NR SA instead of the EPS fallback to LTE function.

# 3 Included Functions

## 3.1 Basic Voice over NR Overview

This feature provides traffic functions and protocol procedures for establishing,

maintaining, and releasing a voice call in NR.

| Feature Name           | Basic Voice over NR                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| Access Type            | NR                                                      |
| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature. No license is required. |

Summary

This feature supports VoNR calls, which allows the handling of voice traffic directly in NR SA

instead of the EPS fallback to LTE function.

The feature enables the modification of QoS parameters and the configuration of the RLC layer

to use unacknowledged mode.

The setup of multiple QoS flows and DRBs for each PDU session is supported for intra-NR mobility

scenarios and IRAT inter-system mobility scenarios to LTE.

NR mobility supports priority for voice services. This prevents handover to an NR

cell where voice service cannot be maintained.

## 3.2 NR Emergency Procedures Overview

The NR Emergency Procedures feature supports the setup of emergency voice calls in an NR

SA deployment.

| Feature Name           | NR Emergency Procedures                                                    |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | NR                                                                         |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The NR Emergency Procedures feature allows the UE to set up an emergency call over NR.

EPS fallback is performed with blind RwR in the following cases:

- If the feature license is not active.
- If EPS fallback is forced during the operation of the feature.

The feature does not support admission control with emergency call prioritization.

By using this feature, regulatory requirements can be met for emergency services.

Additionally, the operator can configure the way an emergency call is established

over NR or LTE.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature uses different ROHC profiles for different protocols, such as IP, UDP,

and RTP, that are applied to the IP flows in the voice bearer. The voice bearer can

contain multiple IP flows with the same or different protocols.

Table 1   Supported ROHC Profiles

| Profile Identifier   | Use            | Reference                    | Description                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0000               | No compression | IETF RFC 5795                | Used if there is no supported profile that matches the packet 										or if there are no more available context identifiers. |
| 0x0001               | RTP/UDP/IP     | IETF RFC 3095, IETF RFC 4815 | Used to compress IP/UDP/RTP headers. Such headers are common 										in a VoIP call or in a video stream.                    |
| 0x0002               | UDP/IP         | IETF RFC 3095, IETF RFC 4815 | Used to compress the RTCP packets, which are used in RTP 										control signaling.                                          |

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Reduced packet size by compressing the IP packet headers of voice bearers that carry VoIP calls.
- Improved coverage as fewer bits of packet headers need to be transmitted.
- Reduced need for radio resources to transmit packets through the Uu interface.

## 3.8 NR Predictive Grant with SR Adaptation Overview

The feature enables packet prediction for UEs that run services with predictable and

periodic traffic in Low-Band and Mid-Band for NR standalone deployments.

| Feature Name           | NR Predictive Grant with SR Adaptation                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5697                                             |
| Value Package Name     | Voice over NR                                            |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Access Type            | NR                                                       |
| Licensing              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature enhances the scheduling of communication services by enabling packet prediction

for UEs with predictable and periodic traffic. The gNodeB estimates the uplink

buffer size for the service based on the following known service characteristics:

- Configured service packet size
- Configured service packet interval

With the buffer estimation, the gNodeB provides more accurate resource allocation for uplink

scheduling and reduces the amount of uplink grants needed to empty the UE

buffer.

When uplink scheduling is based on packet estimation, the PUCCH Scheduling Request (SR)

triggered uplink transmission is less important. In order to reduce the triggered

SRs for the service, SR Delay Timer is used. This improves the uplink system

resources utilization and might lead to improved UE battery performance.

Additional Information

If the feature is used for voice service, see 5G Voice SA RAN Solution Guideline for recommended

features and settings.
