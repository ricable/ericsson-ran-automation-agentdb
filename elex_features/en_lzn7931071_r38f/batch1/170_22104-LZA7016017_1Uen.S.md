Summary

The feature allows the operator to change scheduling priorities by introducing the possibility

to configure rate-controlled scheduling. If the feature is enabled, the scheduler

allocates resources based on the following rate-controlled scheduling operations:

| Prioritized rate     |    | The prioritized rate scheduling operation enables QoS differentiation 								based on the scheduled rate by serving QoS flow traffic with high 								priority until it reaches the rate threshold defined for the 								operation. If QoS flow traffic is above the threshold, it is served 								with low priority. This behavior can be observed even if resource 								contention exists in the cell with UEs that are not using the 								feature.   |
|----------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                      |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Soft rate throttling |    | If there is resource contention, the soft rate throttling scheduling 								operation limits QoS flows to the rate threshold defined for the 								operation. As a result, it can save resources for other UEs in the 								cell, and therefore, it can increase their QoS.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The feature provides configuration options for resource starvation prevention to

limit the amount of spectrum resources that is available to QoS flows prioritized by

rate-controlled scheduling operations. The configuration options provide the

following benefits:

- Control over the system impact of QoS flows prioritized by rate-controlled scheduling operations.
- Reduced risk of spectrum resources getting used excessively by QoS flows prioritized by rate-controlled scheduling operations in poor radio conditions.

The feature is supported in cells with Low-Band and Mid-Band configurations.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Only PCell traffic is used for estimating the maximum channel capacity.

When resource starvation prevention is configured in ESS cells, the channel capacity

estimation does not take into account the limit on the spectrum resources that is

dynamically set by ESS for NR traffic. Because of this, the maximum channel capacity

might be overestimated.

The feature is limited to two DRBs for each UE. If a third DRB of a UE attempts setup

with the feature, the following actions can be performed:

- Set up the third DRB with the basic QoS (default priority domain).
- Reject the third DRB.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling

The feature changes the scheduling priorities of DRBs by using rate-controlled

scheduling operations.

Rate-Controlled Scheduling Operations

If any of the following attributes is set to PRIORITIZED\_RATE or

SOFT\_RATE\_THROTTLING, the feature controls the scheduling

operations of DRBs based on the scheduled rate:

- SchedulingProfile.schedulingAlgorithm
- SchedulingProfile.ulSchedulingAlgorithm

With the feature, the following scheduling operations can be used:

- DRBs configured for the prioritized rate scheduling operation are scheduled to reach the rate threshold configured for the operation. If the scheduled rate is lower than the threshold, the DRB is provided with higher priority and served before DRBs with lower priority in the same cell. Figure 1 Prioritized Rate Scheduling Operation
- DRBs configured for the soft rate throttling scheduling operation are scheduled to reach the rate threshold configured for the operation. If the scheduled rate is higher than the threshold, the DRB is provided with lower priority and served after DRBs with higher priority in the same cell. Figure 2 Soft Rate Throttling Scheduling Operation

Scheduling Process

For the DRBs configured for the rate-controlled scheduling operations, the feature

measures the scheduled rate. The feature dynamically performs the priority domain

shift for the DRB based on the comparison of the measurement and the configured

threshold set in the following attributes:

- DlRateBasedPriority.dlPrioritizedRate
- UlRateBasedPriority.ulPrioritizedRate

Based on the comparison, the following outcomes are possible for the DRB:

- If the measured rate is lower than the configured threshold, the priority domain of the DRB shifts to an elevated state. The elevated priority domain value can be configured with the DU5qi.priorityLevel attribute.
- If the measured rate is higher than the configured threshold, the priority domain of the DRB shifts to a demoted state. The demoted priority domain can be configured by setting the following attributes to HIGH or LOW: DlRateBasedPriority.dlDemotedPriority UlRateBasedPriority.ulDemotedPriority

Table 2 shows the configurable values for

each scheduling operation. The priority value expresses the priority domain, where 1

is the highest priority and 64 is the lowest priority.

Table 2   Priority Domain Values Based on Scheduling Operations

| Scheduling Operation   | Priority Domain   | Priority Value                                     | Attribute                                                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 3.1 Overload Handling

The feature allows the tracking of DRBs that are set up with the feature and handling

DRB overload.

The feature introduces observability counters to track DRBs that are configured for the

rate-controlled scheduling operations. If a DRB attempts setup with the feature, but two

DRBs are already configured, the following attributes determine the operation for the

third DRB in the uplink and downlink channels:

- UlRateBasedPriority.ulDrbOverloadHandling If the value is BASIC, the DRB is set up for the resource fair scheduling operation with the default priority domain, which is 48. If the value is REJECT, the configuration of the DRB with the feature is rejected. Figure 3 Uplink Overload Handling
- DlRateBasedPriority.dlDrbOverloadHandling If the value is BASIC, the DRB is set up for the resource fair scheduling operation with the default priority domain, which is 48. If the value is REJECT, the configuration of the DRB with the feature is rejected. Figure 4 Downlink Overload Handling

To observe if DRBs can be configured for the rate-controlled scheduling operations of the

feature, the uplink and downlink channels are checked separately. Based on the

occupation of the uplink and downlink channels, the following outcomes are possible:

- Uplink is unoccupied, downlink is unoccupied. The DRB can be set up for the rate-controlled scheduling operations.
- Uplink is unoccupied, downlink is occupied. If the DlRateBasedPriority.dlDrbOverloadHandling attribute for downlink is REJECT, the DRB setup is rejected regardless of the setup for the other channel. If the DlRateBasedPriority.dlDrbOverloadHandling attribute for downlink is BASIC, downlink can be set up for the resource fair scheduling operation. Uplink can be set up for the rate-controlled scheduling operations.
- Uplink is occupied, downlink is unoccupied. If the UlRateBasedPriority.ulDrbOverloadHandling attribute for uplink is REJECT, the DRB setup is rejected regardless of the setup for the other channel. If the UlRateBasedPriority.ulDrbOverloadHandling attribute for uplink is BASIC, uplink can be set up for the resource fair scheduling operation. Downlink can be set up for the rate-controlled scheduling operations.
- Uplink is occupied, downlink is occupied. If the UlRateBasedPriority.ulDrbOverloadHandling attribute for uplink is REJECT, the DRB setup is rejected regardless of the setup for the other channel. If the DlRateBasedPriority.dlDrbOverloadHandling attribute for downlink is REJECT, the DRB setup is rejected regardless of the setup for the other channel. If the UlRateBasedPriority.ulDrbOverloadHandling and the DlRateBasedPriority.dlDrbOverloadHandling attributes are BASIC, the DRB can be set up for the resource fair scheduling operation.

## 3.2 Resource Starvation Prevention

The feature provides configuration options to limit the impact of scheduling DRBs

with high priority.

The feature allows the limiting of the spectrum resources allocated for the

rate-controlled scheduling operations. The resource limit is added as an upper bound to

the prioritized rate configured with the

DlRateBasedPriority.dlPrioritizedRate and the

UlRateBasedPriority.ulPrioritizedRate attributes. The resource

limit can be differentiated on a DRB and cell level.

According to the value configured in the

DlResourceBasedPriority.dlResourceLimitMode and the

UlResourceBasedPriority.ulResourceLimitMode attributes, the

following resource limitation modes are possible:

- NO\_LIMIT This mode does not limit the amount of resources available for the rate-controlled scheduling operations. This is the default setting.
- LIMITED This mode determines the total amount of resources that is available for a specific DRB in a cell. The higher the value, the more spectrum resources are allowed for scheduling a given DRB with higher priority. The following attributes determine the resource limit on a DRB level: DlResourceBasedPriority.dlDrbPriorityLimit UlResourceBasedPriority.ulDrbPriorityLimit
- LIMITED\_TO\_CELL\_LIMIT This mode determines the total amount of resources that is available for all DRBs in a specific cell. The higher the value, the more spectrum resources are allowed for scheduling all DRBs with higher priority. The following attributes, which determine the resource limit on a cell level, are applied on top of the DRB-level configuration set in the DlResourceBasedPriority.dlDrbPriorityLimit or the UlResourceBasedPriority.ulDrbPriorityLimit attribute: CellPriorityShift.cellDlDrbPriorityLimitBase CellPriorityShift.cellUlDrbPriorityLimitBase

# 4 Network Impact of NR Rate-Controlled Scheduling

The feature can have an impact on the throughput.

Capacity and Performance

QoS differentiation is applied to QoS flows. This provides a balance between

cell-level throughput and quality.

If resource starvation prevention is configured for rate-controlled

traffic, there is a reduced risk of prioritized QoS flows excessively using the

system resources in poor radio conditions. This way, the performance of other

traffic might also improve.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| Access Type            | NR                              |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                        |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces configuration options for resource starvation

prevention to limit the amount of spectrum resources that is available to QoS flows

prioritized by rate-controlled scheduling operations. As a result, the feature

enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Control over the system impact of QoS flows prioritized by rate-controlled scheduling operations.
- Reduced risk of spectrum resources getting used excessively by QoS flows prioritized by rate-controlled scheduling operations in poor radio conditions.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement provides observability to monitor the ratio of the configured

prioritized rate and the estimated maximum channel capacity. Based on the ratio, the

resource limit can be adjusted.

Operation

If any of the following attributes introduced by the feature enhancement are set to a

value other than the default, a resource limit can be configured:

- DlResourceBasedPriority.dlResourceLimitMode
- UlResourceBasedPriority.ulResourceLimitMode

The following attributes are introduced for resource limitation on a DRB level:

- DlResourceBasedPriority.dlDrbPriorityLimit
- UlResourceBasedPriority.ulDrbPriorityLimit

The following attributes are introduced for resource limitation on a cell level:

- CellPriorityShift.cellDlDrbPriorityLimitBase
- CellPriorityShift.cellUlDrbPriorityLimitBase

The feature enhancement introduces the following EBS counters associated with the

NRCellDU MO to observe the operation:

- pmEbsnDrbPrioritizedRateChannelCapacityDlDistr
- pmEbsnDrbPrioritizedRateChannelCapacityUlDistr

The feature enhancement updates the following PM events with event parameters:

- DuPerUeRbTrafficRep
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr10
- DuPerUeRbTrafficRepAggr60

For more information on the EBS counters and PM events associated with the feature

enhancement, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
