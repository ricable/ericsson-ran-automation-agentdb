# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The document provides a high-level technical description of the main control channels

and signals in NR. The described elements affect control channel overhead calculation.

Technical details conform to the Ericsson product.

Examples of overhead-calculation in downlink and uplink are provided for Low-Band,

Mid-Band and High-Band.

## 1.2 Limitations

This document does not describe ways how to configure different system parameters for

dimensioning. Information on the performance optimization of control channels and guidelines

is not included in this document.

A complete resource map for all configuration combinations is not provided by this

document. Examples are given for typical configurations.

## 1.3 NR Frequency Range-Related Definitions

Low-Band, Mid-Band and High-Band are defined as representations of operating bands

with different duplex modes in 3GPP frequency ranges.

| Term Designation(1)   | 3GPP Frequency Range Designation   | Corresponding Frequency Range   | Duplex Mode   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| Low-Band(2)           | FR1                                | 0–7 GHz                         | FDD           |
| Mid-Band              | FR1                                | 0–7 GHz                         | TDD           |
| High-Band             | FR2                                | 24–50 GHz                       | TDD           |

# 2 Resource Structure

## 2.1 Frequency Domain Structure

OFDM utilizes numerous subcarriers. Each subcarrier is orthogonal to all other

subcarriers.

Subcarrier spacing is equal to the subcarrier bandwidth, which is 2µ × 15

kHz.

Figure 1   Frequency Domain Structure

## 2.2 Numerologies

Table 1   Transmission Numerologies Supported in NR

|   µ |   Δf = 2µ × 15 [kHz] |
|-----|----------------------|
|   0 |                   15 |
|   1 |                   30 |
|   2 |                   60 |
|   3 |                  120 |
|   4 |                  240 |

Ericsson products use different transmission numerologies:

- 15 kHz (µ = 0) for Low-Band
- 30 kHz (µ = 1) for Mid-Band
- 120 kHz (µ = 3) for High-Band

## 2.3 Time Domain Structure

### 2.3.1 Frames and Subframes

Table 2   Time Domain Signal Structure

| Structure Element   | Length (ms)   | Description           |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Frame               | 10            |                       |
| Subframe            | 1             | 1 frame =10 subframes |
| Slot                | 1/2µ          | 1 subframe = 2µ slots |
| OFDM symbol         | 1/(14×2µ)     | 1 slot = 14 symbols   |

Figure 2   Time Domain Signal Structure

One frame is equal to 19660800 × Tc. One subframe is equal to 1966080 ×

Tc. Tc stands for the basic time unit in NR, measured in

seconds, and Tc = 1/(480 × 103 × 4096).

The number of symbols for each structure element depends on the numerology.

Table 3   Number of OFDM Symbols for Each Structure Element

|   µ |   Slot |   Subframe |   Frame |
|-----|--------|------------|---------|
|   0 |     14 |         14 |     140 |
|   1 |     14 |         28 |     280 |
|   2 |     14 |         56 |     560 |
|   3 |     14 |        112 |    1120 |
|   4 |     14 |        224 |    2240 |

### 2.3.2 Slots

One slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols, regardless of numerology.

A long OFDM symbol is an OFDM symbol with narrow subcarrier spacing. A long OFDM symbol

always covers exactly an integer number of shorter OFDM symbols with wider subcarrier

spacing.

Figure 3   Symbol Alignment

### 2.3.3 Slot Categorization for TDD

In TDD, downlink and uplink are transmitted on the same frequency. The resources are

divided in time on symbol level.

The slots are categorized according to the following criteria:

A TDD pattern is built from slots of different categories.

### 2.3.4 Frame Structure

DDSU pattern for TDD

An example of the subframe structure is the DDSU pattern that consists of three

downlink slots and one uplink slot. The third downlink slot is a special slot. In

the special slot, three symbols are configured as a guard period that is used to

switch between downlink and uplink. This configuration is denoted 11:3:0.

Figure 4   DDSU Pattern Example for Mid-Band

Type A and B Transmissions for FDD and TDD

According to 3GPP, NR supports type A and type B transmissions. In the Ericsson

release, only Type A transmission is supported.

Figure 5   Type A and Type B Scheduling

| Type A   |    | Slot-based scheduling     |
|----------|----|---------------------------|
|          |    |                           |
| Type B   |    | Non-slot-based scheduling |

Type A scheduling is similar to LTE scheduling. In this case, the length of the

transmission is an integer number, from one to 13 symbols. Type B scheduling enables

the transmission to start at any symbol. In the current 3GPP release, the length is

limited to two, four, and seven symbols for PDSCH.

## 2.4 Physical Resources

### 2.4.1 Antenna Port

An antenna port is defined by its associated channel or signal.

The supported set of antenna ports depends on the signal configuration in the cell.

### 2.4.2 Resource Element

The smallest resource unit handled in NR consists of the combination of the

following:

- The smallest time domain unit, that is, one OFDM symbol
- The smallest frequency domain unit, that is, one subcarrier

This smallest resource unit is called resource element. Each resource element is uniquely

identified by the index pair (k, l) where

k is the index in the frequency domain and

l is the symbol position in the time domain.

Figure 6   Time and Frequency Domain Structure

### 2.4.3 Resource Block

Resource blocks describe the mapping of certain physical channels to resource elements. A

resource block is defined as 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain. In

contrast to LTE, the resource block is a one-dimensional unit in NR.

### 2.4.4 Resource Grid

A resource grid is defined for each numerology and carrier. The resource grid size is as

follows:

- One subframe = 14 × 2µ OFDM symbols in the time domain.
- 12 × NRB MAX subcarriers in the frequency domain.

NRB

MAX equals the maximum number of resource blocks for a resource grid.

Different numerologies and bandwidths can be specified for resource grids.

| 3   | 120        |                32 |                66 |

Ericsson products use different transmission numerologies:

- 15 kHz (µ = 0) for Low-Band
- 30 kHz (µ = 1) for Mid-Band
- 120 kHz (µ = 3) for High-Band

# 3 Downlink Common Control Channels and Signals

## 3.1 Channels and Signals

The following physical channels are specified to carry downlink control information in

NR:

- PDCCH
- PBCH

Besides the control channels, there are physical signals. The downlink physical signals

are the following:

- DMRS
- CSI-RS
- PTRS (High-Band)
- TRS
- PSS
- SSS
- SI

## 3.2 Physical Downlink Control Channel

The PDCCH carries downlink control information, for example, scheduling assignments. The

PDCCH is transmitted on an aggregation of one or several consecutive CCEs.

Table 7   Possible PDCCH Aggregation Levels According to 3GPP

|   Aggregation Level |   Number of CCEs |   Number of Used Resource Blocks |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
|                   1 |                1 |                                6 |
|                   2 |                2 |                               12 |
|                   4 |                4 |                               24 |
|                   8 |                8 |                               48 |
|                  16 |               16 |                               96 |

One CCE consists of six REGs. One REG equals one resource block during one OFDM

symbol.

The UE monitors the PDCCH in one or more CORESETs. According to 3GPP, a CORESET consists

of NCORESET

RB contiguous or non-contiguous resource blocks in the frequency domain. A

CORESET consists of 1 to 3 symbols in the time domain.

Ericsson products only support contiguous resource blocks in the frequency domain.

Physical Downlink Control Channel Low-Band and Mid-Band

In Ericsson products, for Low-Band and Mid-Band, aggregation levels 1, 2, 4, 8， and

16 are supported.

Figure 7   Example of PDCCH in a CORESET, Low-Band and Mid-Band

In Low-Band one to three symbols can be used for PDCCH, except in cells with 5 MHz

bandwidth, where at least two symbols are used for PDCCH.

In Mid-Band one or two symbols can be used for PDCCH, except in cells with 10 or 15

MHz bandwidth, where two symbols are used for PDCCH.

The number of symbols configured for PDCCH is controlled by the

NrCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute.

For information on the number of configurable symbols for different bandwidths, see

NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid-Band.

In some scenarios, unused PDCCH resources can be allocated for PDSCH, see NR Downlink Data and PDCCH Multiplexing.

The maximum aggregation level for PDCCH can be limited by the channel bandwidth. The

number of CCEs is dynamically adjusted for UE-specific control signaling. Table 8 and Table 9 show maximum number of available

CCEs and maximum aggregation level for different bandwidths, provided that each CCE

spans 6 RBs. The multiplexing of data is not supported for the symbol occupied by

PDCCH.

Table 8   Maximum Number of Available CCEs and Maximum Aggregation Level for Different

Bandwidths, Low-Band

| Bandwidth (MHz)(1)                             | 5    |   10 |   15 |   20 |   25 |   30 |   35 |   40 |   50 |

The NR Large Bandwidth Support Low-Band feature must be

activated to allow the configuration of cell bandwidths

above 20 MHz.

(3)

Eight CCEs are configured in 10 MHz as minimum two

symbols are configured with PDCCH.

(4)

12 CCEs are configured in 15 MHz as minimum two symbols

are configured with PDCCH.

Physical Downlink Control Channel High-Band

For High-Band, aggregation levels 4 and 8 are supported.

In High-Band patterns, the first symbol in the slot is always used for the PDCCH.

Additional PDCCH symbols are added dynamically when scheduling of uplink transmission

is performed.

In High-Band TDD patterns DDDSU and DDSU, one additional symbol for PDCCH can be

added. In TDD pattern DSUUU two additional symbols can be added.

## 3.3 Physical Broadcast Channel

The PBCH carries part of the system information required by the UE to access the network.

Together with the PSS and the SSS, it forms an SSB that is part of the initial access

procedure.

Synchronization Signals

## 3.4 Reference Signals

### 3.4.1 Demodulation Reference Signal for PDSCH

For the DMRS associated with PDSCH, the following apply:

- The reference signal is UE-specific.
- DMRS is transmitted on the same antenna port as the associated PDSCH physical resource.
- DMRS is transmitted only on the resource blocks on which the corresponding PDSCH is mapped.
- Frequency densities are 12 or six for each resource block. This means that one DMRS is transmitted every or every second subcarrier.

The

Downlink

Data and DMRS

Multiplexing

feature

allows

data to be multiplexed between DMRS subcarriers.

For

information about the limitations of this feature, see Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing.

The mapping of DMRS is relative to the slot. A UE is configured with one front-loaded

DMRS in the third symbol. Furthermore, a UE is configurable with an additional DMRS.

Figure 8   Downlink DMRS Scheduling for Transmission Type A

One front-loaded and one additional DMRS is deployed on Low-Band and Mid-Band. On

High-Band, only one front-loaded DMRS is deployed. When the High Speed UE feature is

activated, an additional DMRS is configured on Low-Band and Mid-Band, and one or two

additional DMRSs are configured on High-Band.

SSBs have priority over DMRSs. DMRSs are not sent

in

the 20 resource

blocks that

are occupied by SSBs.

Figure 9   SSB in the Downlink Slot for Low-Band and Mid-Band

### 3.4.2 Channel State Information Reference Signal

For CSI-RS, the following applies:

- Used for RSRP measurements in High-Band beam management
- UE-specific
- Used for calculating the following: CQI PMI Rank Indicator feedback
- Beamformed or non-beamformed
- Multiple users are configurable to measure the same physical CSI-RS signal
- A UE is configurable with multiple CSI-RS resources
- Used for supporting UE beam refinement on High-Band

Resources for Low-Band

In Low-Band, a CSI-RS resource spans two OFDM symbols.

In addition to CSI-RS resources, CSI-IM resources are defined. CSI-IM resources are

configured for the UE to measure downlink inter-cell interference. The pattern is

repeated in each resource block of the bandwidth.

Resources for Mid-Band and High-Band

In Mid-Band and High-Band, a CSI-RS resource spans one, two, or four OFDM symbols,

depending on the number of antenna ports.

In addition to CSI-RS resources, CSI-IM resources are defined. CSI-IM resources are

configured for the UE to measure downlink inter-cell interference. The pattern is

repeated in each resource block of the bandwidth for both Mid-Band and

High-Band.

#### 3.4.2.1 Mapping of CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs to Physical Resources on Low-Band

Two and four antenna ports are supported for CSI-RS resources for Low-Band using classic

radios.

The starting location is symbol 9. Two or four subcarriers are occupied in each resource

block.

For CSI-IM resources, the starting location is symbol 7. The pattern is fixed to 2

symbols × 2 subcarriers in each resource block.

Massive MIMO radio units support the following CSI-RS configurations:

- 8-port CSI-RS
- 16-port CSI-RS
- 32-port CSI-RS
- 8-port CSI-RS + 16-port CSI-RS
- 8-port CSI-RS + 32-port CSI-RS

For more information, see Massive MIMO Low-Band.

Using a larger number of CSI-RS ports improves link adaptation, which results in higher

average UE throughput. Larger CSI-RS port counts result in an increase in overhead as

more PDSCH resource elements are lost to the transmission of CSI-RS, resulting in lower

peak throughput.

#### 3.4.2.2 Mapping of CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs to Physical Resources on Mid-Band

The starting location is symbol 5. Four or eight subcarriers are occupied in each

resource block.

For CSI-IM resources, the starting location is symbol 3. The pattern is fixed to 2

symbols × 2 subcarriers in each resource block.

Massive MIMO radio units support the following CSI-RS configurations:

- 8-port CSI-RS
- 16-port CSI-RS
- 32-port CSI-RS
- 8-port CSI-RS + 16-port CSI-RS
- 8-port CSI-RS + 32-port CSI-RS

To mitigate CSI-RS interference between adjacent cells, the CSI-RS resource positions in

adjacent cells can be shifted with the CSI-RS Interference Mitigation function. For more

information, see Massive MIMO Mid-Band.

#### 3.4.2.3 Mapping of CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs to Physical Resources for High-Band

Two ports are supported for CSI-RS resources for High-Band.

The starting location is symbol 13. One subcarrier is occupied per resource block.

For CSI-IM resources, the starting location is symbol 13. Four subcarriers are occupied

per resource block and antenna port.

### 3.4.3 Phase Tracking Reference Signal Associated with PDSCH in High-Band

PTRS is configured for High-Band.

For PTRS associated with PDSCH, the following applies:

- UE-specific reference signal
- Compensates phase noise effects
- Present only if transmitted together with a PDSCH or DMRS
- One PTRS is transmitted every symbol, every second symbol, or every fourth symbol (time densities are 1, ½, or ¼)
- One PTRS is transmitted every 12th, every 24th, or every 48th subcarrier (frequency densities are 1, ½, or ¼ for each resource block)

PTRS mapping starts at the first symbol that contains PDSCH in the slot. Then it is

mapped to every L symbol, based on time density 1/L. PTRS is not transmitted in OFDM

symbols that contain a CORESET or a PDSCH DMRS.

PTRS mapping restarts at each DMRS symbol, and is then mapped relative to this symbol. In

two adjacent DMRS symbols, mapping restarts using the second DMRS symbol as the

reference.

In the Ericsson product, the physical resource mapping of PTRS is configured according to

the following on High-Band:

- Time density 1
- Frequency density ½
- One front-loaded DMRS

Figure 20   PTRS Physical Resource Mapping for PDSCH, High-Band

### 3.4.4 Tracking Reference Signal

TRS is realized through the CSI-RS. The TRS is used for fine synchronization in time and

frequency, Doppler, and delay spread information. Synchronization is needed for channel

estimation and demodulation.

TRS is only used in connected mode and is transmitted independently of the PDSCH

transmission.

TRS comes in bursts with the following periodicities:

- 10 ms
- 20 ms
- 40 ms
- 80 ms

TRS in Low-Band and Mid-Band

The periodicity is 40 ms on Low-Band and Mid-Band.

Each burst consists of two slots on Low-Band and Mid-Band. TRS is present in two OFDM

symbols in each slot in the TRS burst.

Every

fourth subcarrier is used for TRS.

To mitigate TRS interference between adjacent cells, the TRS resource positions in

adjacent cells can be shifted with the Optimization of TRS Resource Allocations in

Neighboring cell function. For more information, see Massive MIMO Mid-Band. This also prevents the

multiplexing of PDSCH resource elements, which means that the resource elements are

blanked and no data is transmitted in four symbols of a TRS slot.

Figure 21   Physical Resource Mappings of TRS for PDSCH in Low-Band and Mid-Band

TRS power boosting is supported on Low-Band and Mid-Band. This is enabled by

configuring several zero-power CSI-RS resources.

Figure 22   Power Boosting of TRS in Low-Band and Mid-Band

TRS in High-Band

For High-Band, TRS is transmitted in bursts with a periodicity of 20 ms. Each burst

consists of one slot.

The

TRSs use wide beams and one TRS is transmitted for each wide beam. Four TRS symbol

pairs are transmitted in three slots over a 20-ms period. All subcarriers are

allocated for the TRSs in symbols 6-10. The PDCCH and the PDSCH can be allocated in

symbols 0-5.

Figure 23   Physical Resource Mappings of TRS for PDSCH in High-Band

### 3.4.5 System Information

System Information consists of a Master Information Block (MIB) and nine System

Information Blocks (SIB). SI is transmitted mainly in case of standalone (SA).

The MIB is transmitted over the PBCH.

System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1) has a dedicated RRC message; other SIBs are

carried in SI messages.

For the SIB1, the following apply:

- SIB1 resources have priority before other channels and signals.
- Transmitted to the UE at initial setup in SA deployment and NSA deployment when LTE uses ANR for configuration of NR neighbors.
- Contains data required by the UE to evaluate if cell access is allowed.
- Contains radio resource configuration information.
- Defines the scheduling of other SIB messages.

The physical resources are mapped and used as follows:

In Low-Band and Mid-Band:

- Transmitted in one slot every 40th ms in time domain, transmission periodicity is 160 ms with variable number of retransmissions within 160 ms
- 30 RBs, data can be multiplexed in other parts of the bandwidth, outside the allocated 30 RBs

In High-Band:

- Transmitted in one slot every 40th ms in time domain, transmission periodicity is 160 ms with variable number of retransmissions within 160 ms
- For each SSB transmitted on a wide beam there is a corresponding SIB1 transmitted on PDSCH, in total 6 slots per 20 ms are used to transmit SIB1s
- A slot transmitting SIB1 cannot transmit any data on PDSCH

Figure 24   System Information

In Low-Band and Mid-Band, the number of symbols allocated for SIB1 in a slot is 10 for

bandwidths above 5 MHz and 9 for 5-MHz bandwidth.

In High-Band, SIB1 overhead is not dependent on bandwidth as SIB1 will block all other

resources in a slot to be used for PDSCH.

For SIB1 overhead the following apply:

- Low-Band: 0.5-1.6 % depending on bandwidth.
- Mid-Band: 0.1-0.7 % depending on TDD pattern and bandwidth.
- High-Band: 4.1%

In Low-Band and Mid-Band the following apply for SIBx:

- Contains information on cell reselection and warning systems.
- Transmitted in a downlink slot with periodicity defined by the siPeriodicity member.
- Transmitted across the whole bandwidth.
- Overhead caused by SIBx is expected to be low and can be neglected.

In High-Band SA, SIBx are not needed as connected mode mobility is not supported,

therefore SIBx is not transmitted in High-Band SA.

For information on SI and RRC, see 3GPP TS 38.331.

## 3.5 Synchronization Signals

### 3.5.1 Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals

PSS and SSS are used for cell-search procedures and cell identification.

PSS and SSS together carry the PCI. PSS sends one of three orthogonal sequences and SSS

sends one of 336 binary sequences. Therefore, there are 1008 unique PCIs.

### 3.5.2 Synchronization Signal Block

In the time domain, an SSB consists of four OFDM symbols, numbered in increasing order

from 0 to 3.

In the frequency domain, an SSB consists of 20 contiguous resource blocks. The

subcarriers are numbered in increasing order from 0 to 239, starting at the resource

block with the lowest number.

Figure 25   Synchronization Signal Block

The SSB is composed in the following way:

- PSS occupies 127 subcarriers in OFDM symbol 2.
- SSS occupies 127 subcarriers in OFDM symbol 4.
- PBCH occupies 20×12 subcarriers in OFDM symbols 3 and 5. In OFDM symbol 4, PBCH occupies 8×12 subcarriers.

One or multiple SSBs compose a Synchronization Signal burst set. A Synchronization Signal

burst set includes one SSB for Low-Band and Mid-Band, and 12 or 24 SSBs for High-Band.

The default Synchronization Signal burst set selects initial cells every 20 ms.

SSB resources have priority over other channels and signals.

In mid-band, SS/PBCH blocks can be shifted in time to reduce interference in case the

feature NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band is activated.

# 4 Uplink Common Control Channels and Signals

## 4.1 Channels and Signals

The following physical channels are specified to carry uplink control information in

NR:

- PUCCH
- PRACH

In addition to the control channels, the following are the uplink physical signals:

- DMRS
- SRS (for Mid-Band)
- PTRS (for High-Band)

## 4.2 Physical Uplink Control Channel

PUCCH carries uplink control information like HARQ ACKs, NACKs, and scheduling

requests.

Table 10   PUCCH Formats

|   PUCCH Format | Length in OFDM Symbols   | Number of Bits   | Frequency Range       |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
|              0 | 1–2                      | ≤ 2              | High-Band             |
|              1 | 4–14                     | ≤ 2              | Low-Band and Mid-Band |
|              2 | 1–2                      | > 2              | High-Band             |
|              3 | 14                       | > 2              | Low-Band and Mid-Band |

The short PUCCH (one or two symbols) is used for reducing feedback time. It is

transmitted at the end of a slot and it is the last or the second last symbol. One

format is supported for 1-2 bits, another for larger payload sizes.

The long PUCCH (4-14 symbols) provides improved coverage compared to the short PUCCH. One

format is supported for 1-2 bits, but others are also available for larger payload

sizes.

It is possible to piggyback uplink control information on PUSCH resources.

On Low-Band and Mid-Band, PUCCH formats 1 and 3 are

used.

Depending on the information to be carried on PUCCH, one of the following formats is

used:

- PUCCH format 1 for Scheduling Requests and HARQ ACKs or NACKs
- PUCCH format 3 for HARQ ACK or NACK

In Low-Band and Mid-Band, at least one resource block is allocated at both ends of the

carrier for PUCCH format 1.

If the NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity feature is

active, at least four resource blocks are allocated for PUCCH format 1.

In Low-Band, resource blocks for PUCCH format 3 are only configured in PCell if the

NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled attribute is set to

true.

In Mid-Band at least two resource blocks for PUCCH format 3 are configured, unless the

number of resource blocks is limited by the NRCellDU.maxPf3Resources

attribute.

However, the value of the NRCellDU.maxPf3Resources attribute is

adjusted by the system in the following cases:

- If the High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled and the value of the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute is set to a higher value than UP\_TO\_100KMPH, the maximum number of PUCCH format 3 resource blocks is six.
- When both the High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature and the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature are enabled and the value of the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute is set to a higher value than UP\_TO\_100KMPH, the maximum number of PUCCH format 3 resource blocks is four.

To configure additional PUCCH format 3 resource blocks for carrier aggregation, the

NRCellDU.additionalPucchForCaEnabled must be set to

true in the PCell and the

NRCellDU.maxPf3Resources attribute must be set to a lower value

than 4.

On High-Band, PUCCH formats 0 and 2 are used. Short PUCCH is deployed in two consecutive

symbols in High-Band TDD patterns DDDSU and DSUUU, and in three consecutive symbols in

DDSUU. The entire bandwidth is allocated for PUCCH resources in these symbols.

With the Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band feature, PUSCH

can be scheduled on unused PUCCH symbols, if no PDSCH is scheduled in any of the

corresponding downlink slots. This leads to decreased overhead and increased throughput

in uplink.

For High-Band, Scheduling Request (SR) resources are configured. When a UE has pending

uplink data to transmit, the UE triggers a pending scheduling request to notify the

gNodeB. The gNodeB configures dedicated time periodic scheduling request resources

through RRC. If such resources (SR-PUCCH) are configured, then the UE must use them,

otherwise the UE uses random access.

The SR-PUCCH uses one symbol at the end of an uplink slot. With

the Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band feature, PUSCH

can be scheduled on unused SR symbols.

## 4.3 Physical Random Access Channel

PRACH is used for random access. It allows the node to estimate the delay between the

node and the UE.

The first step in the random access procedure is the transmission of a random access

preamble.

The following preamble lengths (LRA) are defined:

- Long sequence: LRA = 839
- Short sequence: LRA = 139

PRACH resources have priority over other channels and signals such as PUSCH and DMRS.

### 4.3.1 Physical Random Access Channel for Low-Band

Both the long and the short sequences are used for Low-Band. Format 0 and format 1 are

deployed for long sequences and format B4 is deployed for short sequences.

The periodicity is 10 ms for Low-Band.

For format B4, the physical resources are mapped as follows:

- 12 symbols in a single slot in the time domain, starting at the first symbol
- 12 resource blocks in the frequency domain, starting from the first available resource block after PUCCH

Figure 26   PRACH Block in Uplink Slot, Format B4

For format 0, the physical resources are mapped as follows:

- 13 symbols in a single slot in the time domain, starting at the first symbol
- Six resource blocks in the frequency domain, starting from the first available resource block after PUCCH

For format 1, the physical resources are mapped as follows:

- 32 symbols over three slots in the time domain, starting at the first symbol
- Six resource blocks in the frequency domain, starting from the first available resource block after PUCCH

### 4.3.2 Physical Random Access Channel for Mid-Band and High-Band

Both the long and the short sequences are used for Mid-Band. Format 0 is deployed for

long sequences and format B4 is deployed for short sequences.

Only the short sequence is used for High-Band, where format A3 or format C2 is

deployed.

The periodicity is 10 ms for Mid-Band and 20 ms for High-Band.

On Mid-Band, the physical resources for format B4 are mapped in the following

configuration:

- 12 symbols in a single slot in the time domain, starting at the first symbol
- 12 resource blocks in the frequency domain, starting from the first available resource block after the PUCCH

The physical resources for format 0 are mapped in the following configuration:

- 26 symbols in two continuous slots in the time domain, starting at the first symbol in the first slot
- Three resource blocks in the frequency domain, starting from the first available resource block after the PUCCH

On High-Band, in the DDDSU pattern, the physical resources are mapped for format A3 as

follows:

- Six symbols for each random access occasion
- One random access occasion for each slot in time domain
- The last symbol is scheduling request
- 12 resource blocks in the frequency domain, but effectively no data is multiplexed at other parts of the bandwidth

Figure 27   PRACH Block in the Uplink Slot of the DDDSU Pattern, High-Band

PRACH format C2 has similar physical resource mapping as PRACH format A3.

With the Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band feature, PUSCH

can be scheduled on unused RACH symbols, if no UE setup request in progress. This leads

to decreased overhead and increased throughput in uplink, especially when PUSCH is also

scheduled at unused PUCCH and SR symbols.

## 4.4 Reference Signals

### 4.4.1 Demodulation Reference Signal for PUSCH

For the DMRS associated with PUSCH, the following apply:

- The DMRS is valid for PUSCH demodulation only if PUSCH transmission is associated with the corresponding antenna port.
- The DMRS is transmitted only on resource blocks with corresponding PUSCH mapped to them.
- Frequency density is six for each resource block, which means that one DMRS is transmitted every second subcarrier.

The

Uplink

Data and DMRS Multiplexing

feature

allows data to be multiplexed between DMRS subcarriers. For more

information, seeUplink Data and DMRS Multiplexing.

Time densities depend on configuration in the same way as the DMRS for PDSCH does. On

Low-Band, Mid-Band and High-Band, the front-loaded DMRS is located in the third

symbol.

Related Information

Demodulation Reference Signal for PDSCH

### 4.4.2 Sounding Reference Signal

The Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band and the Advanced Downlink Multi-User

MIMO Mid-Band features both use SRS. With the help of SRS, the gNodeB can estimate the

downlink channel between the UE and the gNodeB, which is used for beamforming in the

PDSCH.

The following characteristics apply to both periodic and aperiodic SRS:

- SRS is configured with the use of antenna switching.
- On RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units in RAN Compute group 5 and higher, up to 16 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.
- On other RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units, up to 8 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.
- The SRS power, that is the p0 nominal value, is configured with the NRCellDU.pZeroNomSrs attribute.
- Since SRSs are scheduled in unused uplink symbols in special slots, resources are not taken from PUSCH data. Because of this, the SRS does not cause any extra overhead for PUSCH.

Periodic SRS

For periodic SRS, a UE can be configured with a RRCReconfiguration

message to periodically transmit the SRS in the uplink over the configured

bandwidth.

The following characteristics apply to the periodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- A full-band SRS resource spans one uplink OFDM symbol in a special slot.
- A half-band SRS resource spans two uplink OFDM symbols in a special slot.
- Periodicity is with 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 slots. The default periodicity is 40 slots.
- SRS periodicity can be controlled through the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute. This attribute can be used to balance the number of UEs configured for SRS against the throughput gain for each UE.

Figure 29   Periodic SRS Mapping Example with Two UEs Using Different Comb

Offsets

Aperiodic SRS

For aperiodic SRS, the gNodeB triggers a UE to transmit aperiodic SRS on demand

through DCI format 1\_1. The UE is triggered to transmit SRS aperiodically depending

on the demand in terms of UE traffic.

The following characteristics apply to the aperiodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- Four uplink symbols need to be configured in the special subframe.
- The first and third symbol for uplink in the special slot can be configured for aperiodic SRS.
- The ports configured in the uplink symbols for carrying SRS are dynamically shared among the active aperiodic SRS users.
- Half-band SRS is not supported for aperiodic SRS.

Figure 30   Aperiodic SRS Mapping Example with Two UEs Using Different Comb Offsets

in SSF 6:4:4A full-band SRS resource spans one or two uplink OFDM symbols in the

special slot.

Coexisting Aperiodic and Periodic SRS

For periodic SRS, a UE can be configured with a RRCReconfiguration

message to periodically transmit the SRS in the uplink over the configured

bandwidth.

The following characteristics apply to the periodic SRS used for advanced

beamforming:

- A full-band SRS resource spans one or two uplink OFDM symbols in thePeriodicity is with 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 slots. The default periodicity is 40 slots.
- SRS periodicity can be controlled through the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute. This attribute can be used to balance the number of UEs configured for SRS against the throughput gain for each UE.

For aperiodic SRS, the gNodeB triggers a UE to transmit aperiodic SRS on demand

through DCI format 1\_1. The UE is triggered to transmit SRS aperiodically depending

on the demand in terms of UE traffic.

The following characteristics apply to both periodic and aperiodic SRS used for

advanced beamforming:

- A full-band SRS resource spans one or two uplink OFDM symbols in the special slot.
- Four uplink symbols need to be configured in the special subframe.
- The first and third symbol for uplink in the special slot can be configured for both periodic and aperiodic SRS.
- The comb resources are split between periodic and aperiodic SRS users.
- The ports configured in the uplink symbols for carrying SRS are dynamically shared among the active aperiodic SRS users.
- Half-band SRS is not supported when the GNBDUFunction.mixedSrsModeEnabled attribute is enabled.

### 4.4.3 Phase Tracking Reference Signal Associated with PUSCH in High-Band

The PTRS is configured for High-Band.

For PTRS associated with PUSCH, the same applies as for PTRS associated with PDSCH.

Mapping of PTRS starts at the first symbol in the slot that contains PUSCH. A PTRS is

only transmitted in OFDM symbols that contain a PUSCH resource.

Figure 32 shows the physical resource mapping of

PTRS in the following case:

- Time density: 1
- Frequency density: ½
- One front-loaded DMRS

Figure 32   Physical Resource Mappings of PTRS for PUSCH in the DDDSU Pattern, for

High-Band

# 5 Additional TDD Patterns

## 5.1 Background

3GPP provides flexible TDD patterns. For some NR deployments, the Ericsson product needs

to be aligned with specific requirements. Such a requirement, for example, is

coexistence with the LTE network. In other configurations, TDD patterns need to be

optimized for the NR network. The relation between the downlink and the uplink slots is

an example of such an optimization.

Several TDD patterns are available on both Mid-Band and High-Band TDD.

## 5.2 Additional TDD Patterns for Mid-Band

The Ericsson product reuses functionality from the first release to a great extent, while

supporting additional bands and TDD patterns. This provides the following benefits:

- 30 kHz subcarrier spacing for all channels and signals
- One SSB for each TRS
- Short PRACH format
- Single-symbol PDCCH
- Two DMRSs in downlink and uplink
- 14-symbol long PUCCH
- Same periodicities for all channels and signals as for the DDSU pattern

Figure 33   DDDSUUDDDD Pattern with 3:8:3 Special Slot Example

This configuration is especially suitable for coexistence with LTE TDD configuration 2.

When NR and LTE are deployed on the same frequency band, LTE and NR frame structures

need complete alignment. In this way, any interference between the two systems can be

avoided.

Figure 34   Synchronization on Slot Level between LTE and NR

The special slot with three downlink symbols contains only one PDCCH symbol. However, it

does not contain PDSCH or PUSCH symbols. The guard period equals 13 symbols for this

special slot configuration.

The DDDSUUDDDD pattern also allows for the special slot configurations 6:4:4 or 4:6:4.

These configurations support PDSCH with a single DMRS.

Table 11   Available TDD Pattern Examples on Mid-Band

| Pattern               | Special Slot Configuration   | PDSCH in Special Slot   |   Number of DMRSs in Special Slot |   Effective Guard Period in Symbols |

## 5.3 Additional TDD Pattern for High-Band

The available High-Band patterns have the following properties:

- 120 kHz subcarrier spacing for all channels and signals
- SSBs
- TRS slots in downlink
- Short PRACH format
- Short PUCCH

Table 12   Available TDD Patterns for High-Band

| Pattern                           | Special Slot Configuration   | PDSCH in Special Slot   |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 4+1 (DDDSU)                       | 10:2:2                       | Yes                     |
| 3+2 (DDSUU)  Balanced TDD pattern | 12:2:0                       | Yes                     |
| 2+3 (DSUUU)  Uplink-heavy         | 12:2:0                       | Yes                     |

If the Extended Propagation

Delay Support High-Band feature is active and an extended cell range is configured

through the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute, a longer guard period is

required

between downlink and uplink. To support a longer guard period, more guard symbols and

fewer downlink symbols are configured automatically to match the

required

guard period for the configured cell range.

When deploying 24 SSB, the resource usage is modified as follows:

- TRS + CSI-RS: six bursts, eight symbols, frequency density 12 (12 every resource block), periodicity 20 ms
- SSB: 24 blocks, four symbols, frequency density 12 (12 every resource block), periodicity 20 ms
- Unused: unused resource elements in symbols are not used in slots that contain SSB

The resulting downlink resource usage over the bandwidth and for each overall pattern

duration is shown in Table 19.

### 6.3.4 Uplink Resource Usage

Based on the given assumptions, the following channels and signals contribute to resource

use in uplink:

- PUCCH format 2: two + two symbols, effective frequency density 12 (12 every resource block)
- SR: one symbol, frequency density 12 (12 every resource block)
- DMRS for PUSCH: one symbol, scheduling transmission Type A, frequency density 12 (12 every resource block)
- PTRS for PUSCH: time density 1 (1 every symbol), frequency density ½ (one every second resource block) for each layer, two layers for uplink
- PRACH: short sequence, 12 blocks, six symbols, frequency density 12 (12 every resource block), periodicity 20 ms
- No SRS deployment
