Summary

Static routing enables transport and routing of IP datagrams in an IP network, enabling the

node to function as a router in an IP network. The feature enables the configuration

of the routing table that controls the routing of datagrams toward their

destinations.

# 3 Feature Operation of Static Routing

The feature operates according to IETF specifications.

The forwarding functionality of the Static Routing feature operates according to the IETF

specification RFC 1812, Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers. The host

functionality operates according to the IETF specifications RFC 1812, Requirements for

IP Version 4 Routers and RFC 1122, Requirements for Internet Hosts -

Communication Layer.

Static Routing supports null routes. This can be used to avoid routing loops that might occur

when a route becomes unavailable. More information on null routes is available in Manage Transport Network.

## 3.1 IP Packet Forwarding

A standard IP header validation is performed when an IP packet is received from an

external or internal source. The Static Routing feature then performs a route lookup to

determine the packet destination.

After performing a route lookup, the Static Routing feature takes one of the following

actions:

- If the destination address is on the node itself, the packet is delivered locally.
- If the destination is not on the node itself, the route table lookup provides the route that best matches the destination IP address. The best match is the route that has the longest prefix match with the packet destination IP. The route indicates if the destination can be reached directly from one of the interfaces on the node or through a next hop router. Depending on how the destination can be reached, the router takes one of the following actions: If the destination can be reached directly, the next hop MAC address is resolved from the destination IP address. If the destination is on a remote network, the next hop MAC address is resolved from the next hop address for the route. Once the next hop MAC address is resolved according to these steps, the packet is queued for transmission to the next hop.

## 3.2 Routes

The routing table holds the complete set of routes.

The following routes are included in the routing table:

- Static routes configured by the operator. Administrative distance is configurable for each static route.
- Dynamic routes learned from a routing protocol, for example OSPFv2. Administrative distance is configurable for each routing protocol.
- The interface routes to connected subnets. Administrative distance is 0.

Two or more routes with the same destination network prefix are

prioritized against each other by their administrative distance.

The route with the lowest administrative distance is the preferred

route to the destination.

Only one static route to a given destination subnet can be configured with a given

administrative distance.

If a static route and a dynamic route to the same destination network

have the same administrative distance, either route can be preferred.

When troubleshooting static routes, the show ip route command can be

used to display the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables.

## 3.3 Null Routes

A null route can be used as a means to avoid routing loops.

An example to illustrate the use if null routes is when an existing static route to a given

destination network, for example a locally connected subnet, becomes unavailable. Traffic to

this destination network is then routed through a less specific route, if one exists. When

using a default route (to destination 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4, or ::/0 for IPv6), such traffic can

be returned to the same router where it came from. This router then forwards it to the

destination again, creating a routing loop.

To avoid a routing loop, a null route to the destination network is created, and its

administrative distance is set to a value higher than any other routes to the same

destination. The purpose of this configuration is that when all the existing static routes

become unavailable, the null route becomes active. In this way, traffic to the destination is

discarded instead of entering a routing loop.

## 3.4 Resilience

The use of alternative paths to a given destination is supported.

Figure 1   Example of Network with Three Alternative Paths Available from the Source Node to the

Destination Node

Figure 1 shows an example of alternative paths

between two nodes. In this case, the source node can reach its destination node by three

alternative paths. Each alternative path passes through one of the next hop Routers.

With static routing, alternative paths can be achieved by configuring one route for each path

to the destination.

There is no load sharing among multiple routes to the same destination. Only one of the

available routes to the same destination is active at any given time. The configured

administrative distance for each route defines the priority of the routes. The route with the

lowest administrative distance is the preferred route.

Related concepts

Route Availability

## 3.5 Route Selection Process

The route selection process always maintains the set of active routes that constitutes

the forwarding table used for packet forwarding.

## 3.6 Route Availability

The node monitors the availability of each route, and triggers the route selection

process to recalculate the set of active routes.

The node triggers the  route selection process if the availability of a route changes state.

This is based on the following conditions:

- The availability of a route depends on the status of the IP interface over which the next hop can be reached. The value of the InterfaceIPv4.operationalState or the InterfaceIPv6.operationalState attribute must be set to enabled.
- If connectivity to the next hop for an IP route is monitored with a BFD session, the state of the BFD session is also taken into account. This is done to determine the availability of the route. The BfdSessionIPv4.sessionState or the BfdSessionIPv6.sessionState attribute must be set to up.Note: If BFD is enabled, both of the above conditions must be fulfilled for the route to be available. To avoid route flapping due to unstable links when multiple routes exist to the same destination, the following routing hold-down timers can be applied: InterfaceIPv4.routesHoldDownTimer InterfaceIPv6.routesHoldDownTimer When the conditions for route availability are fulfilled, the hold-down timer is started. The route selection process takes the route into account only when the hold down timer has expired. The first time an IP interface comes up after being created, the routing hold-down timer does not apply.

## 3.7 Failover and Failback

Failover and failback are processes that ensure that the best route is used to a given

destination subnet.

| Failover   |    | If the active route to a destination subnet is unavailable, the node chooses the route             with the lowest administrative distance to the same destination subnet. This route             becomes the new active route.   |
|------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Failback   |    | If a route to the same destination subnet with lower administrative distance than what             is currently active is available, it becomes the new active route.                                                             |

## 3.8 BFD Sessions

Single-hop BFD sessions are supported for static routes, and can be used to monitor

connectivity to next hop routers.

BFD sessions can monitor end-to-end connectivity of the entire Layer 3 segment to the next

hop router, including all underlying Layer 2 segments. BFD is used to achieve fast failover

times.

The operation of the BFD feature is described in Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.

The number of simultaneous BFD sessions supported by the data plane is limited to 120. If

this number is exceeded, a session is not available to monitor a given next hop.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
