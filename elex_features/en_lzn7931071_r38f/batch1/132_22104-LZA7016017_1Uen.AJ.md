Summary

This feature improves accessibility to a highly loaded system for prioritized UEs. In this

case, high load means that the number of connected UEs for each affected Sector

Carrier or Baseband Radio Node is about to reach the maximum capacity of the

system.

# 3 Feature Operation of Priority-Based Admission Control

Priority-Based Admission Control uses UE prioritization and prioritized resource

pools to provide higher accessibility to prioritized UEs in scenarios where the maximum

number of connected UEs for each affected Baseband Radio Node or Sector Carrier is about to

be reached.

The Priority-Based Admission Control feature uses two functions to handle the

prioritization of incoming UEs.

UE Admission Control Function 1 uses RRC parameters provided by the UE to determine

priority.  In case of a HO or a DC request the ARP Priority Level of the DRBs or the QoS

flows related to the UE is also used in the calculation. Function 1 is used to protect

resources on the gNodeB and the Sector Carriers.

UE Admission Control Function 2 uses identifiers provided by the core network as well as

RRC cause to determine priority of a UE. Function 2 is used to protect resources on a

cell level.

These function are separate and an incoming UE can go through both in any order, or only

one of them.

## 3.1 Operation of UE Admission Control Function 1

UE Admission Control Function 1 is used for prioritization on the gNodeB and the

Sector Carriers.

UE Admission Control Function 1 uses RRC parameters provided by the UE to determine

priority. In case of a HO or a DC request the ARP Priority Level of the DRBs or the QoS

flows related to the UE is also used in the calculation. This splits incoming UEs into

the following categories:

- Prioritized UEs
- Non-prioritized UEs

UE Admission Control Function 1 reserves a portion of the gNodeB resources for

prioritized UEs. The function divides the gNodeB resources into the following pools:

| Common Pool      |    | The resources in the common pool can be accessed by prioritized and                             non-prioritized UEs.   |
|------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                  |    |                                                                                                                        |
| Prioritized Pool |    | The resources in the prioritized pool can only be accessed by prioritized                             UEs.             |

Figure 1   Priority-Based Admission Control

UE Admission Control Function 1 reserves 3% of gNodeB resources exclusively for

prioritized UEs.

In a scenario where 97% of the resources are in use, the function starts rejecting

non-prioritized UEs, because all resources in the Common Pool are already in use.

In a scenario where 100% of the resources are in use, both non-prioritized and

prioritized UEs are rejected, because all resources in both the Common Pool and the

Prioritized Pool are already in use.

For more information on the current limits of these resources, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.

Figure 2   Resource Use and UE Prioritization

UE Admission Control Function 1 is used to evaluate priority during the following

procedures:

- RRC Connection Setup
- Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Resume
- Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment
- Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment
- Incoming NG Handover
- Incoming Xn Handover
- Secondary Node Addition
- Secondary Cell Group Addition

RRC Connection Setup and RRC Connection Resume requests are differentiated based on the

configured priority of the establishment and resume cause, respectively, in the RRC

messages.

RRC Connection Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default.

The prioritization of UEs during incoming handover, Secondary Node addition, and PSCell

change is based on the ARP Priority Level of the DRBs or QoS flows of the UEs that are

requesting to be connected. If any of these DRBs or QoS flows have an associated ARP

Priority Level that is lower than or equal to 8, the UE is considered a Prioritized

UE.

## 3.2 Operation of UE Admission Control Function 2

UE Admission Control Function 2 is used for prioritization on the cell

level.

UE Admission Control Function 2 uses identifiers provided by the core network as well as

RRC cause to calculate UE priority. It assigns a priority value between 1 and 255 to

each UE. A lower number means higher priority. UE Admission Control Function 2 is made

up of the following functions:

- Priority-based UE admission
- Priority-based UE preemption

The calculated priority value can be used by the priority-based UE admission and

priority-based UE preemption functions to further accommodate high-priority UEs.

The relative priority of UEs is determined through the UE Grouping Framework based on the

following network-provided identifiers:

- RRC establishment cause
- 5QI or QCI
- UE-ARP
- PLMN
- SPID or RFSP
- MCG or SCG role
- S-NSSAI
- IMEISV
- IMEISV-SVN
- IMEISV-TAC
- Paging priority

For more information on the UE Admission Group Type, see UE Grouping Framework.

UE Admission Control Function 2 is used to evaluate priority during the following

procedures:

- NGAP Initial Context Setup
- Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Resume
- Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment
- Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment
- Intra-gNodeB handover
- Incoming NG Handover
- Incoming Xn Handover
- LTE handover without Secondary Node Change
- Secondary Node Addition
- Secondary Cell Group Addition
- Intra-gNodeB PSCell Change
- Inter-gNodeB PSCell Change

Whenever the UE context is modified, UE priority is recalculated. This happens during the

following procedures:

- PDU Session Resource Setup
- PDU Session Resource Modify
- PDU Session Resource Release
- Partial PDU session release
- E-RAB Setup
- E-RAB Release
- Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification

Traffic load in a cell is monitored through the following EBS counters, associated with

the NRCellCU MO:

- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPriorityMaxSa
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPriorityMaxEnDc
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPriorityMaxNrDc
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPrioritySumSa
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPrioritySumEnDc
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPrioritySumNrDc

The gNodeB sorts the UEs in the cell based on the priority values. When the number of

connected UEs is higher than or equal to the configured limit, the gNodeB determines the

priority of the first UE that reaches the configured limit, and uses this value as the

admission priority limit. For example, in Figure 3 the admission priority limit is determined as 8.

Figure 3   Example of Determining the Admission Priority Limit in a Cell

Priority-Based UE Admission

The AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe attribute can be configured to

set the limit of the maximum number of connected UEs, which enables the

priority-based UE admission function. When the load in a cell hits the limit, the

function only admits connection requests with a priority higher than the admission

priority limit.

For example, if the admission priority limit for a cell is determined to be 8, such

as in Figure 3, an incoming UE with priority

9 will be rejected, as the priority is lower than the admission priority limit.

However, if an incoming UE has a priority of 7, it is admitted.

If a UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state is rejected during an RRC Connection Resume attempt, it

is released to RRC\_IDLE state.

Priority-Based UE Preemption

If the priority-based UE admission function is active, the priority-based UE

preemption function can also be enabled by setting the

AdmissionLimit.preemptionRate attribute to a value higher

than 0. To enable more high-priority UEs to connect, this function

periodically releases already established connections with a priority below or equal

to the admission priority limit. UEs are selected for preemption starting with the

lowest priority in the cell. This frees up resources for incoming connection

requests with higher priority.

A UE is only preempted if all the QoS flows related the UE are allowed for

preemption, meaning the Pre-emptionVulnerability IE is set to

true.

The AdmissionLimit.preemptionRate attribute determines how many of

the connections exceeding the configured limit are set as candidates for preemption.

For example, if the AdmissionLimit.preemptionRate attribute is

set to 80, only 80% of the connections over the limit are a candidate for release.

In the example shown on Figure 3, the UEs

with priority 9 and 8 are the candidates for preemption.

## 3.3 Interactions of UE Admission Control Function 1 and UE Admission Control Function 2

UE Admission Control Function 1 and UE Admission Control Function 2 can both reject

UEs based on their different priorities, even if the other function would consider the UE

high-priority.

During incoming handover, Secondary Node addition, and PSCell change UE Admission Control

Function 1 normally prioritizes incoming UEs with DRBs or QoS flows with an ARP Priority

Level less than 8. It is possible that such a UE is rejected by UE Admission Control

Function 2 before the ARP Priority Level is evaluated.

Similarly, it is possible that a UE that would be considered prioritized by UE Admission

Control Function 2 is considered non-prioritized by UE Admission Control Function 1 and

rejected.

If the total capacity limit of all sector carriers that are configured on the gNodeB is

up to the capacity limit of the gNodeB, the number of connected UEs is more likely to

hit the configured sector carrier capacity before the capacity of the gNodeB. In this

case, UE Admission Control Function 2 is more likely to block a UE trying to connect

compared to the UE Admission Control Function 1.

If the total capacity limit of all sector carriers that are configured on the gNodeB is

bigger than the capacity limit of the gNodeB, then the number of connected UEs is more

likely to hit the configured gNodeB capacity before the Sector Carrier capacity. In this

case, UE Admission Control Function 1 is more likely to block a UE trying to connect

compared to UE Admission Control Function 2.

# 4 Network Impact of Priority-Based Admission Control

The feature impacts accessibility KPIs for non-prioritized UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The feature provides increased accessibility for prioritized users.

The accessibility KPIs for non-prioritized UEs might be degraded as the limit of the

available affected resources accessible to non-prioritized UEs is lowered to create

the resource pool accessible only to prioritized UEs.

The capacity for all UEs within a cell is decreased and limited to the configured

value of the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe attribute.

Due to load measurement and reporting for each cell, overall gNodeB processing load

will increase. The amount of increase depends on the frequency of the reporting.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Priority-Based Admission Control

The feature has several associated KPIs, counters, and events.

KPIs

If the priority-based UE admission and priority-based UE preemption functions are

enabled, prioritized UEs that are normally rejected due to reaching the capacity

limit of the cell have a higher chance of being admitted, as they have reserved

resources. Because of this, if there is a high number of prioritized UEs, the

following KPIs can increase:

- UE Context Setup Success Rate
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI
- EN-DC intra-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC inter-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB

If the priority-based UE admission and priority-based UE preemption functions are

enabled, the configured capacity limit for non-prioritized UEs is reduced to secure

the prioritized resource pool. Because of this, if there is a high number of

non-prioritized UEs, the following KPIs can degrade:

- UE Context Setup Success Rate
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI
- EN-DC intra-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC inter-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB

Because of the priority-based UE preemption function, the following KPIs can degrade

for non-prioritized UEs, especially when the load is high:

- SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB
- Differentiated E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost Captured in eNodeB
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only
- DRB Retainability - Session Time Normalized per mapped 5QI Loss Rate, gNodeB triggered only

The overall change in the above KPIs depends on the ratio of prioritized and

non-prioritized UEs attempting to connect.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

## 9.1 Configure HPA Prioritization

Admission requests are prioritized by setting the value of the corresponding MO

attribute. RRC Connection Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default.

Steps

1. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute to 2.
2. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcHighPriorityAccessPrio MO attribute to a value that is lower than or equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute. Note: Because of this, in Example 1 the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcHighPriorityAccessPrio MO attribute is set to 2.

RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default as the value of the

AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio attribute is set

to 1 by default. To remove the default prioritization of RRC

Re-establishment requests, do the following:

3. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio MO attribute to a value that is higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute.

Example 1   Configure HPA and RRC Connection Re-establishment Prioritization

```
ManagedElement=1,GNBDUFunction=1,AdmissionControl=1
admissionPrioThreshold 2
rrcHighPriorityAccessPrio 2
rrcReestablishmentPrio 1
```

## 9.2 Configure HPA, Voice Call Prioritization, and RRC Connection Re-establishment

HPA and voice calls can be prioritized by configuring the corresponding MO

attributes. RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default.

Steps

1. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute to 3.
2. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcHighPriorityAccessPrio MO attribute to 2.
3. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcMoVoiceCallPrio MO attribute to 3.

RRC Re-establishment requests are prioritized by default as the value of the

AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio attribute is set

to 1 by default. To remove the default prioritization of RRC

Connection Re-establishment, do the following:

4. Set the value of the AdmissionControl.rrcReestablishmentPrio MO attribute to a value that is higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.admissionPrioThreshold MO attribute.

Example 2   Configure HPA, Voice Call Prioritization, and RRC Connection

Re-establishment

```
ManagedElement=1,GNBDUFunction=1,AdmissionControl=1
admissionPrioThreshold 3
rrcHighPriorityAccessPrio 2
rrcMoVoiceCallPrio 3rrcReestablishmentPrio 1
```

## 9.3 Configuration of the Maximum Connected UE Capacity

The value of the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe attribute must be set

taking into account the maximum number of connected UEs for each gNodeB and each sector

carrier as described in Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN, and the

desired feature behavior.

Setting this value much lower than the supported sector carrier capacity results in the

following:

- Underutilization of the cell resources
- Higher chance of guaranteed accessibility for high priority UEs
- Reduced risk of scheduler congestion
- Reduced risk of performance degradation

Setting the value of the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe attribute too

high can result in reduced accessibility for high priority UEs and higher chance of

scheduler congestion.

Setting the value to 0 disables cell-level UE admission and preemption

based on Core Network Identifiers.

The recommended value for the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe attribute

is 95% of the maximum number of UEs for a cell. This provides good accessibility

differentiation during the most common traffic scenarios. For example, a high number of

UEs with different priorities, and a portion of high priority users, such as emergency

calls and mission critical users. The number of high priority users does not exceed 10%

of the number of UEs connected to the cell. To handle less common scenarios, such as

disaster scenarios, the value of the AdmissionLimit.maxConnectedUe

attribute should be reduced to meet the safety requirements, at the cost of higher

impact to the accessibility of commercial users.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 23.Q2: Cell-Level UE Admission and Preemption Based on Network-Provided Identifiers

UEs are selectively admitted and released based on cell load and network-provided

identifiers to ensure system accessibility for higher priority

UEs.

|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5402                       |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                    |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                |
| Access Type            | NR                                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement ensures that resources reserved for high-priority UEs are

always available, as long as there are lower priority connected UEs. If resource use

is high, the following admission control functions are activated:

- Priority-based UE admission: UE priority is decided based on Core Network Identifiers. At each incoming connection request UE priority is used to decide whether a new UE can be admitted or not.
- Priority-based UE preemption: UE priority is decided based on Core Network Identifiers. Priority-based UE preemption is performed periodically to bring the cell load below the configured limit. This is done by releasing already connected low-priority UEs, until the cell load is below the configured limit.

The following result can be achieved by activating the admission control

functions:

- More successful incoming connection setups for high priority UEs compared to low-priority UEs.
- Faster setup for connecting UEs.
- The number of rejections increases for low-priority UEs.
- Low-priority UEs can be preempted.

Capacity and Performance

When the priority-based UE admission and priority-based UE preemption functions are

enabled, the maximum number of connected UEs in each cell is decreased to a

configurable maximum limit. The processing load of the gNodeB also increases because

of the load measurement and reporting. Higher frequency of reporting causes higher

processing load.

If the priority-based UE admission and priority-based UE preemption functions are

enabled, prioritized UEs that were previously rejected because of reaching the

capacity limit have a higher chance of being admitted, as they have reserved

resources. Because of this, if there is a high number of prioritized UEs, the

following KPIs can increase:

- UE Context Setup Success Rate
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI
- EN-DC intra-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC inter-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB

If the priority-based UE admission and priority-based UE preemption functions are

enabled, the configured capacity limit for non-prioritized UEs is reduced to secure

the prioritized resource pool. Because of this, if there is a high number of

non-prioritized UEs, the following KPIs can degrade:

- UE Context Setup Success Rate
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI
- EN-DC intra-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC inter-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB

Because of the priority-based UE preemption mechanism, the following KPIs can degrade

for non-prioritized UEs, especially when the load is high:

- SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB
- Differentiated E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost Captured in eNodeB
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only
- DRB Retainability - Session Time Normalized per mapped 5QI Loss Rate, gNodeB triggered only

The overall change in the KPIs depends on the ratio of prioritized and

non-prioritized UEs attempting to connect.

The following EBS counters associated with the NRCellCU MO can be

used to observe the number of connected UEs in a cell:

- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPriorityMaxEnDc
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPriorityMaxNrDc

- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPrioritySumEnDc
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelPrioritySumNrDc
