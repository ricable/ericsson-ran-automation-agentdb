# 1 NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Overview

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity enables NR carrier capacity licenses on the

radio node for High-Band. This capacity is automatically activated during software

upgrade.

Summary

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity introduces NR carrier capacity licenses configured

for High-Band on the gNodeB. Carrier frequency configuration

is more than 6 GHz. For the configuration of the NR sector carrier, one licensed

capacity unit is required for every 50 MHz bandwidth. A sufficient amount of license

units have to be available on the gNodeB when unlocking a

sector carrier. Otherwise, the unlock operation is not successful.

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity is automatically activated when the gNodeB receives a software upgrade. License activation is

not needed for this capacity. The capacity cannot be deactivated once it is

activated as a result of a node software upgrade.

# 2 Dependencies of NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity has no dependencies to other features, but

is related to the node capacity.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity is related to the overall node capacity.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity allocates licensed 25+25 MHz sector carrier

capacity units.

A sufficient amount of licensed capacity units must be available on the gNodeB before setting the

NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState to UNLOCKED.

Otherwise the operation is not successful. During carrier capacity evaluation, the gNodeB compares the number of required and available capacity

units.

Calculating the Required Capacity Units for NR Sector Carrier

The 25+25 MHz channel bandwidth is the capacity granularity when the sector carrier

is configured for a frequency band more than 6 GHz. Capacity granularity applies to

each sector for each gNodeB.

The operator can calculate the required number of 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity

units for one sector carrier with the following formula:

The NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL and the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL attributes must be set to equal

values. The &lt;configured TDD channel bandwidth&gt; is determined by the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL attribute.

The formula applies when the NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL attribute is

set to a value that places the radio channel above 6 GHz.

As an example, if the

&lt;configured

TDD channel

bandwidth&gt;

is 100 MHz, two capacity units are required.

Checking 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity

The operator can get information about the 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity of the

node by checking the CapacityState.currentCapacityLimit attribute

value.

Allocating 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units

When unlocking a sector carrier, the node checks if there are sufficient available

25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units. The following outcomes are possible:

- If there are sufficient available licenses, the gNodeB allocates the 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units to the sector carrier. The sector carrier unlock procedure continues.
- If the available 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units are insufficient for the sector carrier, the sector carrier unlock operation fails. The MO Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the Key alarm is triggered.

Releasing 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units

When locking a sector carrier, the 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated

to the sector carrier are released and returned to the pool.

Changing 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity

The number of 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units can be changed by the following

methods when a new LKF is installed:

- If the new LKF allows a lower number of 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units than the allocated license, the activated sector carriers stay in service. However, unlocking a new sector carrier is not allowed because of license allocation failure. To release the amount of units matching the new units to match the new license capacity, the operator can select sector carriers to be locked.
- If the new LKF allows more 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units, the operator can unlock more sector carriers. After the installation, the gNodeB runs the automatic recovery process of the sector carriers that failed to unlock.

Automatic Recovery Process

When a new license key with more 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units is installed

on the gNodeB, it attempts automatic recovery. The

conditions for automatic recovery are the following:

- The operator tried to unlock the sector carrier.
- The sector carrier raised an alarm due to the shortage of licensed capacity units.
- The NRSectorCarrier.operationalState attribute has the DISABLED value.

The automatic recovery unlocks as many failed sector carriers as the new capacity

enables. The sector carriers that are not unlocked by the automatic recovery still

have the DISABLED value, and the alarm is raised on them.

# 5 Parameters for NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity affects the

NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState parameter.

Table 1   Parameters

| Parameter                           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState | Affected | When set to UNLOCKED, the capacity units are checked                                 in the sector carrier and the required number of units is                                 allocated.  When set to LOCKED, all allocated capacity units are                                 released in the sector carrier. |

# 6 Performance of NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier

The NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier capacity introduces a new counter to measure the number

of allocated 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units. There are no associated KPIs or

events.

KPIs

This capacity has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This capacity introduces the following counter:

- GNBDUFunction.pmLic25Plus25MHzScActualNote: This counter shows the current number of licensed 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated to all sector carriers. If the gNodeB does not have unlocked sector carriers, the counter reports 0 value.

Events

This capacity has no associated events.

# 7 Enable or Disable Capacity

While license-controlled features need to be individually activated, capacities are

automatically enabled when the License Key File is installed on a node. Capacity cannot

be deactivated once it is enabled on the node.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity enforces the 25+25 MHz sector carrier license rules to the gNodeB as part of a software upgrade.

Software Upgrade

The 25+25 MHz sector carrier license rules are immediately enforced during the

upgrade as node restart results in unlocked cells and sector carriers. To avoid

network disturbance, operators need to have a clear upgrade strategy for all gNodeBs. The following high-level process is recommended:

1. Add 25+25 MHz Sector Carrier licenses to each customer bulk in Ericsson License Information System.
2. Download new LKFs which contain the number of licensed 25+25 MHz sector carrier capacity units depending on the customer contract.
3. Deploy the new LKFs before downloading the software.
4. Ensure that all LKFs are updated before rolling out the software.
