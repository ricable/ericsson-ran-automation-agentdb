Summary

When two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, PIM signals can occur. PIM signals created by downlink carriers can

interfere with signals transmitted by uplink carriers.

The feature detects PIM-originated interference that comes from frequencies in one

gNodeB and maps affected cells into victim-aggressor groups, which provides the

following benefits:

- It is possible to detect PIM on suspected sector carriers chosen by the system as potentially affected by PIM, either as victim or aggressor.
- Information on the detected aggressors is provided for each identified victim sector carrier.

# 2 Dependencies of NR PIM Detection

# 3 Feature Operation of NR PIM Detection

This feature introduces PIM detection for Baseband Radio Nodes in NR. PIM detection

acts as a diagnostic tool for analyzing PIM interference.

When two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, PIM signals can occur. PIM signals created by downlink carriers can

interfere with signals transmitted by uplink carriers. The feature categorizes carriers

for diagnostic purposes in the following ways:

| Aggressor   |    | A downlink carrier whose frequency undergoes intermodulation that results                             in unwanted frequency components that spread and interfere with cell                             transmissions.   |
|-------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Victim      |    | An uplink carrier that is affected by interference created through                             intermodulation.                                                                                                         |

The feature detects interference, and it maps affected cells into victim-aggressor

groups. PIM interference can occur in the following types of carriers:

- Single carriers
- Dual carriers
- Triple carriers
- Multiple carriers

These are then identified as single, dual, triple, or multiple downlink aggressors.

This feature only detects dual aggressors.

Figure 1 shows an example of PIM third order

intermodulation spectra for Baseband 25 (1940 MHz Tx and 1980 MHz Tx), 10 MHz

Bandwidth carriers.

Figure 1   Third Order PIM Spectrum Impacting 1900 MHz

Figure 2 gives an example of aggressor-victim

groups. For example, if the uplink carrier A1 is a victim, possible aggressor

combinations are as follows:

- A1A2
- A1B1
- A1B2
- A1C1
- A1C2
- A2B1
- A2B2
- A2C1
- A2C2
- B1B2
- B1C1
- B1C2
- B2C1
- B2C2
- C1C2

Figure 2   Aggressor-Victim Groups

To measure victim-aggressor dependencies, the feature considers interference and load

measurements at each analyzed sector carrier. Uplink interference power is retrieved

from the NRCellDU.pmRadioRecInterferencePowerDistr counter, reported

by the Baseband Radio Node. The most important sector carriers to detect and analyze are

the sector carriers with a PIM interference power of -112 dBm and above. PIM

interference power values are represented by the following bins:

- Bin[15]: ]-112..-108] dBm/PRB
- Bin[16]: ]-108..-104] dBm/PRB
- Bin[17]: ]-104..-100] dBm/PRB
- Bin[18]: ]-100..-96] dBm/PRB
- Bin[19]: ]-96..-92] dBm/PRB
- Bin[20]: ]-92..] dBm/PRB

The bins contain the number of samples for the measured noise and interference power.

Operational Process

The feature does not require manual activation; however, the PIM detection function

must be enabled. The PIM detection function is governed by the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled attribute.

Figure 3   Operational Sequence Diagram of PIM Detection

1. The PIM detection is initiated by setting the MO attributes to select the PIM detection candidate cell.
2. The victim-aggressor group is selected for the PIM detection based on the configuration. The victim-aggressor group is basic unit of the PIM detection and consists of one victim cell and dual aggressor cells. The victim-aggressor group selection results are shown by the NRCellCU.pimDetectionRole attribute.
3. The PIM detection is performed using the selected victim-aggressor groups.

After 24 hours, the system uses the collected data to calculate the correlation

between interference and load measurements to predict PIM impact. The PIM detection

results are shown by the CuCpPimDetectionReport event and the

NRCellCU.pimDetectionStatus attribute.

If the NRCellCU.pimDetectionStatus attribute is

PIM\_DETECTED in the PIM detection result, the cell is evaluated

as a victim. Otherwise, the NRCellCU.pimDetectionStatus attribute

is NO\_PIM\_DETECTED. For more information about the

CuCpPimDetectionReport event, see Performance of NR PIM Detection.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

- CuCpPimDetectionReport Event Event Parameter Description CuCpPimDetectionReport aggressor\_cells Aggressor ids that affect the cell. pim\_type The type of detected PIM victim-aggressor relation, which can be one of the following: PIM\_TYPE\_NO\_PIM PIM\_TYPE\_CLEAR\_PAIR\_AGGRESSOR PIM\_TYPE\_LIKELY\_PAIR\_AGGRESSOR pim\_interference\_pwr The measured PIM interference power level for this cell. pim\_detection\_reliability Reports the confidence metric of PIM measurements.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR PIM Detection

The feature detects PIM-originated interference that comes from frequencies in one

gNodeB and maps affected cells into victim and aggressor groups.

## 8.1 Configure NR PIM Detection

This feature allows the automatic selection of the sector carriers that are

potentially affected by PIM.

The NR PIM Detection function is configured on the node level and governed by the

following attributes:

- GNBCUCPFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled
- NRSectorCarrier.pimDetectionEnabled

When the GNBCUCPFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled attribute is set

to true, it takes priority over the

GNBDUFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled and

NRSectorCarrier.pimDetectionEnabled attributes.

To configure the GNBDUFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled and

NRSectorCarrier.pimDetectionEnabled attributes, the

GNBCUCPFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled attribute must be set

to false, and the node must be restarted.

Prerequisites

The

GNBCUCPFunction.resourceStatusReportF1Enabled attribute must be

set to true to ensure that the feature identifies victims and

aggressors.

Steps

1. Set the GNBCUCPFunction.pimAutoDetectionEnabled attribute to true.

aggressors towards LTE cells as victims.

The gNodeB provides load measurement information for the eNodeB so that the PIM

detection algorithm in the eNodeB might calculate whether certain NR cells can be

aggressors.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following PM events are introduced to observe EN-DC status reporting:

- CuCpX2EndcResourceStatusRequest
- CuCpX2EndcResourceStatusResponse
- CuCpX2EndcResourceStatusFailure
- CuCpX2EndcResourceStatusUpdate

Interfaces

This feature enhancement introduces the following messages on the X2 interface to

exchange load

measurement

information for multi-node PIM detection:

- EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
- EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE
- EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE
- EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.
