Hardware

(FAJ 121The feature is optimized for AIR 3268 and AIR 6488 radio units. For other

Massive MIMO radio units, dedicated calibration might be needed. Additionally, CBRS

is supported on both AIR 3268 and AIR 6488 for LTE and NR.

Limitations

- Adding or removing cells or equipment requires that the group is removed from the CBRS Domain Coordinator and readded after update.
- Mixed mode is supported only with single Baseband unit.
- Only NR Standalone deployment with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing is supported.
- Only NR TDD patterns aligned with LTE TDD configuration 1 and 2 are supported.
- Only TDD band 48 is supported for a CBRS band.
- Soft lock is not supported.
- The maximum total carrier bandwidth cannot exceed 100 MHz for AIR 3268 radio units.
- The maximum total carrier bandwidth cannot exceed 60 MHz for AIR 6488 radio units.
- Up to four cells with LTE and NR mixed mode configuration can be supported for each CBRS radio, with maximum two NR cells. Note: NR and LTE mixed mode configurations are supported with up to 3 cells and with a maximum of 2 NR carriers for AIR 6488 radio units.
- Up to two NR cells can be supported for each CBRS radio.

Network Requirements

CBRS support requires ENM with CBRS Domain Coordinator. It is recommended to use ENM

version 23.3 or higher for this feature.

For the CBRS Domain Coordinator, Domain Proxy PKI security certificate is required

for communication with SAS.

Network reliability depends on the reliability of the connection to the SAS and the

DNS.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Massive MIMO Support for CBRS

The feature allows NR CBRS for Massive MIMO radio units by restricting EIRP to comply

with FCC regulations.

The transmitted power is configured automatically by the CBRS Domain Coordinator based on

the maximum EIRP in the authorized grants from SAS and the bandwidth. The Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit feature allows

adaptive power backoff by considering the impact of downlink single-user and multi-user

MIMO transmissions to comply with EIRP requirements.

For a more detailed description of CBRS, see Citizens Broadband Radio Service

Guidelines.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Massive MIMO Support for CBRS

The feature might decrease downlink throughput to comply with power regulations.

Using CBRS can increase cell load and decrease cell availability.

Capacity and Performance

With the adaptive power limitation, downlink throughput is expected to decrease.

However, the feature provides the highest possible throughput with the given power

backoff based on FCC requirements. The throughput can be observed with the following

KPIs:

- Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average DL PDCP UE Throughput
- Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput

CBRS support increases capacity by allowing the operator to use the shared

spectrum.

The feature can decrease cell availability. This is because the NR cells and sector

carriers operating in CBRS band stay disabled until receiving an authorization from

SAS, and become disabled again if the authorization is suspended or expires.

Network load between the node and the CBRS Domain Coordinator is increased because

the time stamp and measurement collection are regularly updated.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Massive MIMO Support for CBRS

Attributes for adaptive power limitation are used for this feature to comply with

power regulations.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q4.0: AIR 6488 Band 48 NR Upgrade with Mixed Mode Support

This feature enhancement provides NR upgrade support and mixed mode support on the

n48 band for AIR 6488.

| Feature Name           | NR Massive MIMO Support for CBRS   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5569                       |
| Value Package Name     | Massive MIMO Enabler               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4004                       |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                |
| Access Type            | NR                                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                           |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Support of AIR 6488 NR upgrade on the n48 band, with either of the following beamforming types: Type-1 codebook-based downlink in multi-user MIMO or single-user MIMO beamforming Advanced downlink in multi-user MIMO or single-user MIMO beamforming Note: A 10-60 MHz NR carrier bandwidth is also supported for AIR 6488 on the n48 band.
- Support of LTE + NR mixed mode on the n48 band

Capacity and Performance

The operating bandwidth of AIR 6488 is up to 60 MHz on the n48 band.

This feature enhancement can support the following numbers of layers for multi-user

MIMO and single-user MIMO:

- For downlink transmissions, 16 layers are supported for multi-user MIMO and four layers are supported for single-user MIMO.
- For uplink transmissions, four layers are supported for multi-user MIMO and two layers are supported for single-user MIMO.

The achievable capacity and performance are impacted by the bandwidth and power

granted by SAS.

Operation

The CBRS DC upgrade is supported only on NR-capable radios.

The following conditions must be confirmed before upgrading the CBRS-DC software to

include this feature enhancement:

1. The radio software is upgraded with AIR 6488 Band 48 NR Upgrade with Mixed Mode Support.
2. The ENM version is upgraded to 24.4 or later.
3. Both upgrades are released.

CBRS applications on AIR 6488 in NR can be enabled or disabled with either of the

following beamforming types:

- Type-1 codebook-based downlink in single-user MIMO or multi-user MIMO beamforming
- Advanced downlink in single-user MIMO or multi-user MIMO beamforming

LTE support for AIR 6488 B48 is not affected.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is applicable to AIR 6488 that support the n48 band.

Other Network Elements

This feature enhancement requires the following Network Elements:

- ENM It is recommended to use ENM version 24.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
- UE This feature enhancement is only applicable to UEs that support the n48 band.
