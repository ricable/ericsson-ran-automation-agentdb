Summary

The NR RRC Connection Re-establishment feature allows the restoration of the UE context of a

UE that lost connection in the serving cell.

The NR RRC Connection Re-establishment feature supports both the intra-gNodeB and the

inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure with packet forwarding based

on configuration.

The RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is initiated by the UE when one of the following

conditions applies:

- The UE detects RLF in the serving cell
- Reconfiguration with synch failure in the serving cell
- Mobility from NR failure
- Integrity check failure
- RRC connection reconfiguration failure

The NR RRC Connection Re-establishment feature has the following benefits:

- From the gNodeB perspective, UE and bearer retainability KPIs are improved because the UE stays connected to the network with no abnormal releases.
- Reduced signaling between the 5GC and the gNodeB, because the connection of the UE is not released and set up again.
- Reduced signaling between the UE and the gNodeB because the connection of the UE is not released and set up again.
- Reduced user plane interruption time at RLF.
- Reduced downlink packet loss at RLF.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The NR RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is not possible in the following

cases:

- The UE context cannot be retrieved.
- A UE procedure other than the supported procedures is ongoing.
- The UE is configured with NR-DC.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR RRC Connection Re-establishment

This feature supports the intra-gNodeB and the inter-gNodeB RRC Connection

Re-establishment procedures with packet forwarding.

The feature introduces the following functions:

- Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure
- Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure
- Fallback to RRC Establishment procedure
- Enhanced RLF supervision

When the UE loses the connection to the serving cell, it can start the RRC Connection

Re-establishment procedure if the following conditions are met:

- The UE must be in RRC\_CONNECTED state.
- AS security must be established with SRB2 and at least one DRB.

The UE can start the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure by sending the RRC

RRCReestablishmentRequest message to the gNodeB. The message contains the

following information:

- The C-RNTI that is used in the cell where the RLF occurred.
- The PCI of the cell in which the RLF occurred.
- The Short Message Authentication Code for Integrity (MAC-I).

During the intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, the UE starts the RRC

Connection Re-establishment procedure with the last serving gNodeB where the UE context

is stored, and the gNodeB can retrieve the UE context internally.

During the inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, the UE moves to a cell

that belongs to a different gNodeB and starts the RRC Connection Re-establishment

procedure. The current gNodeB retrieves the UE context from the last serving gNodeB

through the Retrieve UE Context procedure over the Xn-C interface.

This feature can be configured with the

GNBCUCPFunction.rrcReestSupportType attribute.

## 3.1 Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

When the UE starts the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure and the gNodeB can

retrieve the UE context internally, the gNodeB continues with the RRC Connection

Re-establishment procedure.

Figure 1   Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

The Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is executed at the detection

of RLF according to the following steps:

1. The UE sends the RRCReestablishmentRequest message to the gNodeB and starts the Rrc.t301 timer.
2. The gNodeB checks the following conditions: The UE context can be retrieved internally. No UE procedures other than the supported procedures are ongoing. The UE is not configured with NR-DC. The RrcUeCfg.rrcReestForcedFallback attribute is set to FALSE.
3. After retrieving the UE context the gNodeB performs the following steps:
    - Restoring the UE context
    - Re-activating the AS security
    - Resume SRB1
4. The gNodeB sends the RRCReestablishment message to the UE on SRB1.
5. The UE sends the RRCReestablishmentComplete message to the gNodeB.
6. The gNodeB sends the RRCReconfiguration message after a successful re-establishment to resume SRB2, and DRBs, and to reconfigure the UE with any required measurement configurations.
7. The UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the gNodeB.

Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment is executed for

PDU sessions that are mapped to supported network slices. PDU sessions mapped to

unsupported network slices are reported by the gNodeB by sending the NGAP PDU SESSION

RESOURCE NOTIFY message to the AMF. The message contains a list of PDU session resources

failed to set up because not all the network slices used by the UE are supported in the

target cell.

## 3.2 Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

The UE can start the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure in a neighboring cell

of the last serving cell, where the RRC re-establishment target gNodeB can retrieve the UE

context from the last serving gNodeB.

The Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment function must be configured for the

feature to work.

For inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, the RRC Re-establishment

target and the last serving gNodeB must be connected through the Xn-C interface.

The candidate last serving gNodeBs are represented by the

ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO in the RRC Re-establishment target

gNodeB if the following conditions are met:

- The ExternalNRCellCU.nRPCI attribute under ExternalGNBCUCPFunction MO is matched with the PCI of the cell where the RLF occurred.
- The Xn-C connection between the candidate last serving gNodeB and the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB is established.

Figure 2   Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

The inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is executed according to the

following steps:

1. The UE sends the RRCReestablishmentRequest message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB and starts the Rrc.t301 timer.
2. The gNodeB checks the following conditions to trigger the Retrieve UE Context procedure: The UE context cannot be retrieved internally. The GNBCUCPFunction.rrcReestSupportType attribute is set to INTRA\_INTER\_GNB\_RRE. The candidate last serving gNodeB is found in the MO.
3. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB retrieves the UE context through the Retrieve UE Context procedure.
    1. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message to the last serving gNodeB. The XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message contains the following information: C-RNTI Failure Cell PCI Short MAC-I Target Cell Identity
    2. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB starts a timer internally to monitor the Retrieve UE Context procedure. Note: The timer is set for a value less than the Rrc.t301 timer, so the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB can finish the Retrieve UE Context procedure before the UE goes to RRC\_IDLE state.
    3. The last serving gNodeB checks the following conditions of the Retrieve UE Context procedure: The GNBCUCPFunction.rrcReestSupportType attribute is set to INTRA\_INTER\_GNB\_RRE. The last serving gNodeB can retrieve the UE context. No UE procedures other than the supported procedures are ongoing. The UE is not configured with NR-DC.
    4. If the conditions of the Retrieve UE Context procedure are met, the last serving gNodeB sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE message with the UE context to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB. Note: If any of the conditions of the Retrieve UE Context procedure are not met, the last serving gNodeB sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT FAILURE message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
4. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB checks if any of the fallback conditions are met.
5. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB reactivates the AS security, and sends the RRCReestablishment message to the UE on SRB1.
6. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB sends the XnAP XN-U ADDRESS INDICATION message to the last serving gNodeB.
7. The UE sends the RRCReestablishmentComplete message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
8. The last serving gNodeB can send the XnAP SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
9. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB sends the RRCReconfiguration message to the UE after a successful re-establishment to resume SRB2 and DRBs, and to reconfigure the measurement configuration.
10. The UE sends the RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
11. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB completes the NGAP Path Switch Request procedure with the AMF. When security related information received in the NGAP PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, an intra-cell handover is triggered. Security information is synchronized with the UE and the UE is kept in connected state.
12. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB sends the XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to the last serving gNodeB.

After the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB sends the XnAP UE CONTEXT

RELEASE message to the last serving gNodeB, further configuration procedures

can be performed.

The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB can send out the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT

REQUEST message to more than one candidate last serving gNodeB. If the RRC

Re-establishment target gNodeB receives the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT

RESPONSE message from one of the candidate last serving gNodeBs, it starts

the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure without waiting for the other candidate

last serving gNodeBs to respond.

Fallback during Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

## 3.3 RRC Connection Re-establishment During Ongoing Supported Procedures

The Intra-gNodeB and Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is

supported during certain ongoing UE procedures.

When the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is triggered, the last serving gNodeB

checks if any UE procedures are ongoing. If any unsupported UE procedures are ongoing,

the Fallback to RRC Connection Establishment procedure is performed. If any supported UE

procedures are ongoing, the ongoing UE procedures are aborted, and the RRC Connection

Re-establishment without Fallback procedure is performed.

The following UE procedures are supported:

- Intra-gNodeB Handover
- Outgoing NG-based inter-gNodeB Handover
- Outgoing Xn-based inter-gNodeB Handover
- Outgoing IRAT Handover to LTE
- Measurement Reconfiguration
- SCell Reconfiguration
- RRC Reconfiguration initiated by the gNodeB-DU
- RRC Reconfiguration after RRC Re-establishment
- Downlink NAS Transport

If re-establishment happens during an outgoing handover or RRC Reconfiguration after RRC

Re-establishment, the last serving gNodeB starts packet forwarding to the

re-establishment target gNodeB. In the case of inter-gNodeB connection re-establishment

packet forwarding is only started if it is requested by the target gNodeB.

## 3.4 Fallback to RRC Connection Establishment Procedure

If the UE starts the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure and the gNodeB detects a

fallback condition, fallback to RRC Connection Establishment is performed.

### 3.4.1 Fallback during Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

During the intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, fallback to the RRC

Connection Establishment is triggered by the gNodeB in the following cases:

- The UE context cannot be retrieved internally.
- A UE procedure other than the supported procedures is ongoing.
- The UE is configured with NR-DC.
- None of the network slices used by the UE are supported.
- The NR Cell Soft Lock feature is active in the target cell. Note: In this case, after the gNodeB receives the RRCSetupComplete message, the gNodeB sends the RRCRelease message to the UE.
- The RrcUeCfg.rrcReestForcedFallback attribute for the UE is set to TRUE.
- The NRCellDU.cellBarred attribute is set to BARRED.Note: In this case, after the gNodeB receives the RRCSetupComplete message, the gNodeB sends the RRCRelease message to the UE.

Figure 3   Fallback during Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

Fallback to the RRC Connection Establishment procedure at intra-gNodeB RRC Connection

Re-establishment is executed according to the following steps:

1. The UE starts the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure by sending the RRCReestablishmentRequest message to the gNodeB.
2. The gNodeB detects a fallback condition and starts the RRC Connection Establishment procedure by sending the RRCSetup message to the UE.
3. The UE sends the RRCSetupComplete message to the gNodeB.
4. The gNodeB sends the NGAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE to the AMF.
5. The Initial Context Setup procedure is performed.

### 3.4.2 Fallback during Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment

During the inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, fallback to RRC

Connection Establishment is triggered by the gNodeB in the following cases:

- The GNBCUCPFunction.rrcReestSupportType attribute is set to INTRA\_GNB\_RRE.
- The gNodeB to which the UE attempts to perform RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is unable to retrieve the UE context internally and no candidate last serving gNodeB is found for the Retrieve UE Context procedure.
- The timer for Retrieve UE Context procedure expires.
- The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB receives the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT FAILURE message from the last serving gNodeB.
- The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB starts multiple Retrieve UE Context procedures and all the candidate last serving gNodeBs send the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT FAILURE message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
- The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB cannot select any PLMN IDs based on the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE message and the current configuration of the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
- None of the UE security capabilities included in the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE are supported.
- None of the network slices used by the UE are supported.
- The NR Cell Soft Lock feature is active in the RRC Re-establishment target cell. Note: In this case, after the gNodeB receives the RRCSetupComplete message, the gNodeB sends the RRCRelease message to the UE.
- The RrcUeCfg.rrcReestForcedFallback attribute for the UE is set to TRUE.
- The NRCellDU.cellBarred attribute is set to BARRED.Note: In this case, after the gNodeB receives the RRCSetupComplete message, the gNodeB sends the RRCRelease message to the UE.

1. The UE starts the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure by sending the RRCReestablishmentRequest message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
2. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB checks if the UE context can be retrieved from a candidate last serving gNodeB and sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message to the last serving gNodeB.
3. The last serving gNodeB is unable to retrieve the requested UE context and sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT FAILURE message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
4. The gNodeB detects a fallback condition and starts the RRC Connection Establishment procedure by sending the RRCSetup message to the UE.
5. The UE sends the RRCSetupComplete message to the gNodeB.
6. The gNodeB sends the NGAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE to the AMF.
7. The Initial Context Setup procedure is performed.

## 3.5 Enhanced RLF Supervision

The feature improves the RLF supervision procedure by introducing the

RrcUeCfg.tWaitForRrcReestRequest timer. The timer is used to set

a waiting time before the gNodeB starts the UE Context Release procedure.

During the waiting period, the last serving gNodeB waits for one of the following

messages:

- The RRCReestablshmentRequest message is sent by the UE to the gNodeB during intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure, in case the gNodeB detects the RLF earlier than the UE.
- The XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message is sent by the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB to the last serving gNodeB during the inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure.

Re-establishment

1. The gNodeB detects RLF because of downlink RLC delivery failure.
2. The gNodeB starts the RrcUeCfg.tWaitForRrcReestRequest timer using UE group information to wait for the RRCReestablishmentRequest message from UE.
3. The gNodeB performs the following action:
    1. If the gNodeB receives the RRCReestablishmentRequest message from the UE before the timer expiry and the conditions for RRC connection re-establishment are matched, the RRC connection is re-established.
    2. If the RrcUeCfg.tWaitForRrcReestRequest timer expires before the gNodeB receives the RRCReestablishmentRequest message from the UE, the UE context is released.

1. The last serving gNodeB detects RLF because of downlink RLC delivery failure.
2. The last serving gNodeB starts the RrcUeCfg.tWaitForRrcReestRequest timer using UE group information to wait for the RRCReestablishmentRequest message from UE or the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message from the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
3. The UE sends the RRCReestablishmentRequest to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
4. The RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message to the last serving gNodeB.
5. The last serving gNodeB stops the RrcUeCfg.tWaitForRrcReestRequest timer and sends the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE message to the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB.
6. If the conditions for RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure are fulfilled, the RRC Re-establishment target gNodeB performs the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure. Note: If the RrcUeCfg.tWaitForRrcReestRequest timer expires before the gNodeB receives the RRCReestablishmentRequest message or the XnAP RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE context is released.

# 4 Network Impact of NR RRC Connection Re-establishment

The feature impacts DRB retainability, service time interruption, packet loss, and

signaling.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves retainability KPIs, as the RRC Connection Re-establishment

procedure reduces the number of abnormal UE releases.

The feature also reduces user plane interruption time and downlink packet loss.

The feature enables the UE to establish a new connection faster with the RRC

Connection Re-establishment procedure. If fallback to the RRC Connection

Establishment procedure is performed when the RRC Connection Re-establishment

procedure is triggered during an ongoing procedure, the Handover, DRB Accessibility

and DRB Retainability KPIs might degrade depending on network circumstances,

configuration, and UE behavior. To mitigate the impact indicated by the KPI

degradation, adjusting the relevant parameters is recommended.

Interfaces

The signaling load between the 5GC and the gNodeB is decreased during both intra- and

inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q1: Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment with Packet Forwarding

The feature enhancement allows the NR RRC Connection Re-establishment feature to

support the Inter-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure with packet

forwarding.

| Feature Name:           | NR RRC Connection Re-establishment   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5346                         |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                      |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                         |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                  |
| Access Type:            | NR                                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the target gNodeB to retrieve the UE context from the

candidate source gNodeBs if the UE context is not retrieved internally for the RRC

Connection Re-establishment procedure. The UE context is retrieved through the

Retrieve UE Context procedure over the Xn interface.

Fallback to the RRC Connection Establishment procedure is performed if the UE is

configured with NR-DC or a different UE procedure is ongoing.

Packet forwarding is supported during the inter-gNodeB RRC Connection

Re-establishment procedure. With packet forwarding, packet loss is reduced.

RLF supervision is updated. Besides the RRCReestablishmentRequest, the

gNodeB waits for the XnAP RETRIVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message before

starting the RRC Release procedure.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- From the gNodeB perspective, UE and bearer retainability KPIs are improved because the UE stays connected to the network with no abnormal releases.
- Reduced signaling between the 5GC and the gNodeB because the UE is not released and setup again.
- Reduced signaling between the UE and the gNodeB because the UE is not released and setup again.
- Reduced user plane interruption time at RLF.
- Reduced downlink packet loss at RLF.

Capacity and Performance

The following KPIs related to the bearer retainability are improved:

- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only

The RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure success rate can be observed with the

RRC Reestablishment Success Rate PI.

Operation

The feature enhancement can be enabled by setting the

GNBCUCPFunction.rrcReestSupportType attribute to

INTRA\_INTER\_GNB\_RRE.

The following PM counters are introduced to monitor the Retrieve UE Context

procedure:

- NRCellCU.pmUeCtxtRetrieveAttRrcReest
- NRCellCU.pmUeCtxtRetrieveSuccRrcReest

The following EBS counters are introduced to monitor the Retrieve UE Context

procedure:

- pmEbsUeCtxtRetrieveAttRrcReest
- pmEbsUeCtxtRetrieveSuccRrcReest

The following EBS counters are introduced to monitor the RRC Connection

Re-establishment procedure differentiated for each DRB:

- pmEbsRrcConnReestDrbAtt

| Access Type            | NR                                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement reduces user plane interruption, because the UE can perform

the RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure for PDU sessions in the supported

slices.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Intra-gNodeB RRC Connection Re-establishment is executed for PDU sessions that are

mapped to supported network slices. PDU sessions mapped to unsupported network

slices are reported by the gNodeB sending the NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE NOTIFY

message to the AMF. The message contains a list of PDU session resources failed to

set up because not all the network slices used by the UE are supported in the target

cell.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the NG-C interface and updates the NGAP PDU

SESSION RESOURCE NOTIFY message. The NGAP PDU SESSION RESOURCE

NOTIFY  message can contain a list of PDU session or QoS flow resources

failed to set up during internal resource allocation in the gNodeB and for

unsupported network slices in the target cell.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only

The following PM counters might increase because of the higher number of

re-establishment attempts with packet forwarding:

- EP\_XnU.pmPdcpPktFwdTransDlQos
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpPktFwdTransDlXnU5qi
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpPktFwdRecDlQos
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpPktFwdRecDlXnU5qi
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnReestAtt
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnReestSucc

The following PM counters might decrease because of the lower number of fallbacks to

RRC Establishment:

- EP\_NgU.pmPdcpPktRecDlDisc5qi
- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalGnbAct5qi
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeAttOutInterGnb
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutEutran
- NRCellCU.pmHoPrepSuccOutInterGnb
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnReestFallbackAtt
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnReestFallbackSucc
