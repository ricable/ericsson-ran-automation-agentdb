Summary

This feature provides the eNodeB with an address that does not have to be translated

to NAT. The new address space supports 2128 (about 3.4Ã—1038)

addresses.

The IPv6 feature enables the operator to deploy nodes in an IPv6 network, and to

directly communicate with external IPv6 networks without using additional address

translation or tunneling mechanisms.

This feature can be used for new IPv6 node deployment, as well as for upgrading nodes

that need to migrate from an IPv4 to an IPv6 RAN.

IPv6 addressing is supported for virtual (loopback) IP interfaces.

When using IPsec, IPv6 addressing is supported in both the inner and outer

networks.

This feature can be used to automatically assign default routes and the following

addresses:

- Dynamic IPv6
- DNS server

Additional Information

More information about this feature and related topics can be found in the following

documentation:

- RFC 2460: Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification
- RFC 2464: Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks
- RFC 2710: Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6
- RFC 3315: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
- RFC 3596: DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6
- RFC 4291: IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture
- RFC 4443: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification
- RFC 4861: Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)
- RFC 4862: IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

# 2 Dependencies of IPv6

This feature has no feature and hardware dependencies, but it has limitations related

to autoconfiguration.

Features

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- There is no support for autoconfiguration of MTU or hop limit. These parameters are ignored if received as an option of Router Advertisement (RA) messages.
- For IPv6 interface used for advertising RA message to the cascaded node, only manual address configuration mode is supported.
- If autoconfiguration is enabled for the InterfaceIPv6 MO, only one InterfaceIPv6 MO is supported within the same Router MO instance.
- When IPv6 autoconfiguration is enabled, no RouteTableIPv6Static can be created in the Router MO.
- When autoconfiguration is enabled, only the following MOs can refer to an AddressIPv6: IpsecTunnel NtpFrequencySync PtpBcOcPort OamAccessPoint TwampTestSession TwampResponder TwampLightResponder

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of IPv6

The IPv6 feature enables the operator to expand the number of addresses in the RAN and

avoid NAT.

With this feature, NDP is used instead of ARP on the link layer. This reduces the broadcast

traffic in the system.

The IPv6 feature can be used for dynamic IPv6 address allocation with SLAAC and DHCPv6 on the

eNodeB. The feature also includes allocation of the default

route and the DNS server address. The default route and the DNS server address is obtained

through NDP Router Advertisement (RA) messages or the DHCPv6 protocol.

The node automatically selects SLAAC, DHCPv6 or both, based on the following criteria:

- Content of the received NDP RA messages
- Configuration set by the operator

## 3.1 IPv4 and IPv6 in the Same Network

The eNodeB can separate IPv4 and IPv6 packets and manage a mixed situation with

traffic on IPv4 and OAM on IPv6, or the other way around.

On the network level, the following nodes are IPv6-capable as shown in Figure 1:

- MME
- SGW
- PDN-GW

An eNodeB in the IPv4 domain communicates with the same nodes as the IPv6 eNodeBs. The

nodes respond on both IPv4 and IPv6 addressed packets.

IPv6 is supported as inner and outer address in IPsec tunnels for both traffic and

OAM.

Handover between eNodeBs with different IP versions is carried out using S1 handover

rather than direct X2 handover. Handover is made automatically without any configuration

and there is an automatic check of IP version. If the IP versions do not match, a

handover is made using S1.

The use of VLAN and compatibility between IPv4 and IPv6 VLANs must be supported by the

first router in the network. The eNodeB is independent on the VLAN level.

The RBS autointegration over IPv6 works only if there are cascaded nodes connected to the

first node.

## 3.2 DHCPv6 Relay for Cascaded Nodes

In a cascaded topology, transmission of DHCPv6 traffic is possible between DHCPv6

clients and DHCPv6 servers, which are not located on the same network, through the DHCPv6

relay agent.

In this topology, the first node is the DHCPv6 relay agent and the cascaded nodes are the

DHCPv6 clients. The first node acts as a router, that is, an intermediary between an

external DHCP server and the client. The DHCPv6 relay feature requires the first node to

support the following functions:

| Router Advertisement Transmission   |    | With this function, the first node sends the indication of address                         configuration to the cascaded node through a Router Advertisement (RA)                         message.   |
|-------------------------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                     |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| DHCPv6 Relay                        |    | With this function, the cascaded node can acquire the IPv6 address and other                         configuration information.                                                                      |

When these functions are supported, Zero Touch autointegration for cascaded topology can

be enabled on the new cascaded node as well. With this function enabled, the cascaded

node can acquire the IPv6 address and other autointegration configuration information

through the first node. The RA message indicates for the cascaded node the use of the

first node as the default router and the use of IPv6 address assignment through DHCPv6

or SLAAC. If DHCPv6 is indicated for IPv6 address assignment, a cascaded node can

acquire the IPv6 address and other configuration information through the DHCP relay

agent.

# 6 Performance of IPv6

The performance of this feature can be measured by several KPIs and

counters.

KPIs

KPIs associated with this feature measure the following

quantities:

- Ingress packet number and bps
- Egress packet number and bps
- Ingress errors, drops and discards

For more information, see Transport Network Performance Indicators.

Counters

The counters associated with IPv6 are specified in RFC 4293, Management

Information Base for the Internet Protocol (IP).

For more information, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

Events

This feature has no associated PM events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for IPv6

If IPv6 autoconfiguration is used, the operator does not need to configure all

connected nodes, only the routers and DHCPv6 servers.

DHCPv6 servers handle each VLAN as a separate interface, and have separate address pools

for each interface. This means DHCPv6 can handle identical DUID and IAID pairs if they

are related to different VLANs. IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration requires that the LAN

segment uses a /64 prefix length.

DHCP Unique Identifier Configuration Alingned with Zero Touch Autointegration

Software

When DHCPv6 is used to receive stateful IPv6 addresses, setting the

AddressIPv6.duidType attribute to

DUID\_EN\_SERIAL\_NUMBER configures the DHCP client to use a DUID

aligned with the Zero Touch autointegration software.

This alignment allows the assignment of one IP address to a host in the DHCPv6

server. The IP address is provided during the autointegration phase and after the

upgrade for an IPv6 interface when running the Upgrade Package (UP) software.

Security Concerns When Using DHCP or DHCPv6 Relay and Router Advertisement

Transmission

DHCP or Router Advertisement (RA) transmission-related configurations enable specific

transport network ports. With these ports, unauthorized equipment can acquire access

to the operator network.

When the DHCP relay or RA transmission is configured in the node, the transport

network ports get enabled on the node as one of the following roles:

- RA transmitter
- DHCP relay agent for connecting host nodes
- DHCPv6 relay agent for connecting host nodes

Any equipment, including non-Ericsson products, connected to the enabled ports have a

chance to acquire valid IP addresses through SLAAC or stateful DHCP. It enables

these equipments to acquire access to the operator network opened to this IP.

It is recommended to use static allocation based on client IDs or MAC addresses in

the DHCP or DHCPv6 server. It reduces the risk of allocating IP addresses to

unauthorized users. It is also recommended to ensure that unauthorized devices

cannot connect to the enabled transport network ports. It can be ensured physically

or by using authentication mechanism, such as 802.1x. Remove the DHCP or DHCPv6

relay configuration, or disable the unused port when it is not needed for connecting

any DHCP client.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: IPv6 on Inner Networks

| Access Type:       | LTE,  GSM             |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Hardware Platform: | All Baseband products |
| Licensed Feature:  | IPv6 (FAJ 121 0858)   |

IPv6 on inner network enhances the IPsec in Baseband products to support IPv6 on the

inner network, while IPv4 is still the only option for the outer network. With this

feature, it is possible to protect IPv6 traffic from/to the node over an

IPv4network.

Appendix A.a: IPv6 on Inner Networks

## Appendix A.b: 17.Q4: IPv6 on Outer Network

IPv6 on outer network enables the availability of both IPv4 and IPv6 for the inner

network and the outer network, in any combination.

| Feature Name:           | IPsec               |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0804 R7     |
| Value Package Name:     | IPsec               |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0417 R6     |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE, GSM            |

IPv6 on outer network enhances IPsec in Baseband products to support IPv6 on the outer

network. This means that IPv4 and IPv6 are both available for the inner network and the

outer network, in any combination. The inner network and the outer network can have the

same protocol (IPv4 on both networks or IPv6 on both networks), or different protocols

(IPv6 on the inner network and IPv4 on the outer network, or IPv4 on the inner network

and IPv6 on the outer network).

For more information, see IPsec or Manage IPsec.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following attributes have new valid references:

- MO AddressIPv6 is a valid reference for the localAddress attribute on MO IpsecTunnel
- MO PeerIPv6 is a valid reference for the remoteAddress attribute on MO IpsecTunnel

The address attribute on MO PeerIpv6 can

represent the fully qualified domain name of the peer.

## Appendix A.c: 18.Q3: DHCPv6 and SLAAC for Autoconfiguration of IPv6 Addresses

The feature enhancement introduces support for IPv6 autoconfiguration on the Baseband

Radio Node.

| Feature Name:           | IPv6                |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0858 R7     |
| Value Package Name:     | IPv6                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0418 R5     |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

The feature enhancement enables the use of SLAAC or DHCPv6 for allocation of IPv6

addresses, default routes, and DNS server addresses on the Baseband Radio Node. The IPv6

feature can be used to configure IPv6 addresses automatically, which lowers the risk of

node misconfiguration. The enhancement simplifies IPsec configuration if the outer

address is assigned through SLAAC or DHCPv6.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The IPv6 feature enhancement introduces a new MO attribute,

AddressIPv6.duidType.

To support IPv6 autoconfiguration with SLAAC, DHCPv6, or both, the following MO

attributes are updated :

- AddressIPv6.address
- AddressIPv6.configurationMode
- DnsClient.configurationMode
