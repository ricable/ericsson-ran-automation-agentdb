# 1 Bridged Virtual Interface Overview

The Bridged Virtual Interface feature provides functionality to send and receive routed

layer 3 traffic through a layer 2 bridge. The feature works as a gateway between a switched

and a routed network.

Summary

Bridged virtual interfaces complement Ethernet-based IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces, and support the

same features. The Bridged Virtual Interface feature is used to provide a gateway

for a bridge that connects two or more network segments. This creates an aggregate

Ethernet network, and allows routed traffic to use a built-in bridge as a link

layer.

If a DHCP relay is configured and listens on the bridged virtual interface, the bridge does

not transfer the incoming DHCP request and DHCP

discover messages. The messages are relayed by the DHCP relay

service.

As the bridged virtual interface is an IP interface, it interacts, for example, with the

following protocols:

- Static routing
- OSPF
- BFD
- Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL)
- IP termination

# 2 Dependencies of Bridged Virtual Interface

The feature has prerequisite features to create the link layer of the bridged virtual

interface.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

| Feature                           | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ethernet Switching (FAJ 121 4413) | Prerequisite   | The Ethernet Switching feature is required to create a bridge that                                 works as the link layer of the bridged virtual interface. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The switched layer 2 network accessed through the bridge must be connected to other

layer 3 entities.

# 3 Feature Operation of Bridged Virtual Interface

This feature allows the routed layer 3 traffic to enter or exit through a layer 2

bridge.

In an RBS context, this feature allows the baseband unit to act as a gateway between a

switched and a routed network. This allows OAM traffic to be terminated on a

bridged virtual interface.

Figure 1   Bridged Virtual Interface in the Context of the Transport Network

A MAC address is assigned to the bridged virtual interface and it acts as a layer 3

interface, similar to an Ethernet-based layer 3 interface.

Frames with the bridged virtual interface MAC address as destination MAC address received on

any of the bridge ports, are terminated at the bridge virtual interface.

When a layer 2 frame is received with the bridged virtual interface MAC address as source

address, it is discarded. MAC learning is not done for such frame.

Broadcast frames received on a bridge port are transferred on the bridge, as well as

terminated on the bridged virtual interface.

When DHCP relay for IPv4 is configured on the node, the DHCP relay listens to DHCP

request and DHCP discover messages incoming

on the bridged virtual interface. In this case, the bridge does not transfer

those messages, but it passes them through the bridged virtual interface to

be handled by the DHCP relay service.

Layer 3 packets transmitted from a bridged virtual interface through a bridge respect the

configured DSCP to PCP mapping table for each Ethernet port on the bridge. Layer 2 frames are

not remarked, for example the ARP frames.

For packets received on a bridged virtual interface, the configured trust

DSCP setting is respected.

The connected subnet configured on a bridged virtual interface is considered down when all

constituent layer 2 interfaces on the bridge instance have status

down.

# 6 Performance of Bridged Virtual Interface

The performance of this feature can be monitored by counters.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

There are counters associated with this feature. More information can be found in Managed Object Model (MOM).

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
