# 1 RRC Inactive State Overview

This feature enables the gNodeB to release the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state instead of

RRC\_IDLE state when inactivity is detected. This feature also supports RRC Resume procedure

from RRC\_INACTIVE state, when the UE needs to be in RRC\_CONNECTED state.

Summary

The RRC Inactive State provides the following benefits:

- Signaling and transition time is reduced, when the UE resumes from RRC\_INACTIVE state to RRC\_CONNECTED state.
- When the UE is released to RRC\_INACTIVE state, it stores the radio configuration and security parameters.
- The RRC\_INACTIVE state allows wireless UEs to enter a low-power mode when not transmitting or receiving data or signaling.
- Reduced latency and battery consumption of UEs.

Hardware

This feature is supported on all NR Baseband units except Baseband 6621.

Limitations

From RRC\_INACTIVE state, only intra-gNodeB RRC Resume procedure is supported.

Packet forwarding is not supported during Intra-gNodeB Inter-Capacity Module

Resume.

RRC Inactive users are considered to have the same processing cost as RRC Connected

users, because of the RNA Updates when the UE moves between gNodeBs in RRC Inactive

state. RRC Inactive users are included in the RRC Connected user Baseband

capacity.

Extra signaling occurs, when the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state moves to a cell that is

served by a different gNodeB.

UEs that are configured with eDRX cannot be moved to RRC\_INACTIVE

state. Instead, the UEs are moved to RRC\_IDLE state.

Network Requirements

The 5GC must be able to provide Core Network Assistance Information for the

gNodeB.

The UE must support RRC\_INACTIVE state.

To fully benefit from the feature, ENM version 21.4 or later is

recommended.

Interaction with Bandwidth Part

During RRC Resume Connection procedure, the UEs in RRC\_INACTIVE state use initial

BWP. After the procedure is complete, dedicated BWP is used, depending on UE

capabilities.

# 3 Feature Operation of RRC Inactive State

This feature allows the gNodeB to release a UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state instead of RRC\_IDLE

state. The UE can resume RRC\_CONNECTED state with the RRC Resume procedure.

This feature allows the gNodeB to release a UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state when inactivity on

uplink and downlink detected.

When the UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state, the DRBs and SRBs, except for SRB0, are suspended

between the UE and the gNodeB. The UE-specific bearers are maintained between the gNodeB

and the 5GC. Therefore, the 5GC handles the UE as connected.

If there is downlink data or signaling for the UE, the gNodeB initiates paging in the RAN

Notification Area (RNA), so the UE can resume connection.

If the UE needs to send data, it resumes to RRC\_CONNECTED state with the RRC Resume

procedure while staying in the RNA. If the UE relocates to another cell, which is not

included in the RNA, the UE initiates RNA Update procedure.

The gNodeB can support RRC\_INACTIVE state, if it receives the Core Network Assistance

Information (CNAI) from the 5GC. The CNAI consists of information that is used by the

gNodeB to configure RRC\_INACTIVE state procedures for the UE.

UEs that are configured with eDRX cannot be moved to

RRC\_INACTIVE state because it is not supported. Instead, the UEs are moved to RRC\_IDLE

state.

The 5GC sends the CNAI in one of the following messages:

- INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
- UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST
- HANDOVER REQUEST
- PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE

This feature introduces the following procedures:

- RRC Release with suspendConfig
- RRC Resume Connection procedures: RRC Resume Connection RRC Connection Resume with Fallback to RRC Connection Establishment RRC Connection Resume Followed by Network Suspend RRC Connection Resume Followed by Network Release RRC connection Resume Followed by Network Reject
- RAN Initiated Paging

Operational Process

1. The gNodeB releases the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state with the RRCRelease message with suspendConfig, if there is no downlink or uplink activity. Note: The UE-specific bearers are maintained between the 5GC and the gNodeB.
2. The UE enters RRC\_INACTIVE state.
3. If there is downlink or uplink data or signaling for the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state, the UE can access the network through the same gNodeB.
4. RRC Resume procedure is performed and the UE resumes to RRC\_CONNECTED state.

Figure 2   Transition between RRC\_CONNECTED and RRC\_INACTIVE State

## 3.1 RRC Release with Suspend Configuration

The gNodeB releases the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state by sending the RRC Release message

with suspendConfig. The UE and the gNodeB stores radio protocol

information and security parameters.

Figure 3   RRC Release with Suspend Configuration

1. The gNodeB detects inactivity in uplink and downlink. Inactivity is detected by the expiry of the following timers:
    - InactivityProfileUeCfg.nasInactivityTime
    - InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimer For more information on inactivity timers, see NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer.
2. The gNodeB decides if the UE can be released to RRC\_INACTIVE state. The gNodeB releases the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE state if the following conditions are met:
    - The RRC Inactive State feature is enabled.
    - The UE supports RRC\_INACTIVE state.
    - The CNAI is stored in the UE context.
    - The UE is not configured with NR-DC.
    - The UE is not in limited service mode.
    - The RrcInactiveProfileUeCfg.rrcInactiveStateSupport attribute is set to True.
3. The gNodeB stores the UE context and sends the RRCRelease message with suspendConfig to the UE. The RRCRelease message contains the following information:
    - Inactive Radio Network Temporary Identifier (I-RNTI)
    - RNA (RAN Notification Area)
    - Periodic RNA Update Timer (t380)
    - RAN Paging Cycle Note: The paging cycle broadcasted in the SIB message is used here as well.
    - The nextHopChainingCount
4. The UE executes the following actions after receiving the RRCRelease message: Storing the UE AS Inactive context Suspending the SRBs and DRBs, except for SRB0 Sending an acknowledgment for the RRCRelease message Note: If the gNodeB does not receive the acknowledgment, the connection is released with the user-inactivity cause.
5. The UE transitions to RRC\_INACTIVE state.

I-RNTI

The I-RNTI is a unique identification for RRC\_INACTIVE state for the UE Inactive

Context. I-RNTI contains a unique ID for the gNodeB and for the UE context.

When the UE transitions to RRC\_INACTIVE state, the gNodeB provides the I-RNTI to the

UE. When the UE transitions to RRC\_CONNECTED state from RRC\_INACTIVE state, it sends

back the same I-RNTI to the gNodeB.

the following types of I-RNTI are included in the RRCRelease

message:

- Full I-RNTI The full I-RNTI contains 14 bits unique UE ID and 26 unique Node ID.
- Short I-RNTI The short I-RNTI contains 14 bits unique UE ID and 10 unique Node ID.

Figure 4   Full and Short I-RNTI Configuration

RAN Notification Area

The RAN Notification Area (RNA) is a selected group of cells belonging to a gNodeB

where the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state can move without updating the location

information. The gNodeB sends the paging messages to every cell in the RNA.

The RNA is configured for each UE as a list of cells that belong to the same gNodeB.

The minimum RNA size is one cell.

During the configuration of the RNA, the following information from the CNAI and MRL

are considered:

- The serving cell where the UE is connected.
- The neighbor cells that have cell relation with the serving cell.
- Cells with TAC and active PLMNs that match TAI list field advertised in CNAI.
- Cells with TACs and active PLMNs that are allowed by the MRL
- Cells that are not allowed are excluded from the RNA.
- Cells are excluded where the active PLMNs are not included in the Serving or Equivalent PLMN list.

## 3.2 RAN Initiated Paging

This feature allows the gNodeB to notify the UE if there is any downlink signaling or

data transfer from the 5GC.

The RNA (RAN Notification Area) allows the gNodeB to locate the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

The gNodeB-based location management allows the inactive UE to move in the RNA without

notifying the network.

When the UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state, UE paging is managed by the gNodeB. Since the UE

related resources are not suspended between the 5GC and the gNodeB, the 5GC treats the

UE as connected. RAN initiated paging has the same paging cycle as the 5GC paging.

The gNodeB initiates paging when receives the following messages:

- Downlink data sent by the 5GC
- DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
- PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
- PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND
- PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST
- UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST

The gNodeB sends the paging message to all the cells indicated in the RNA. The gNodeB

attempts the paging for maximum three times. If the paging procedure fails, the gNodeB

sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message to the 5GC.

Figure 5   RAN-Initiated Paging

1. The gNodeB receives downlink user data or signaling for a UE which is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.
2. The gNodeB sends the paging messages to every cell in the RNA for the UE. The Inactive Radio Network Temporary Identifier (I-RNTI) is indicated in the paging message. If the UE does not respond to the paging messages, the gNodeB repeats the paging.
3. When the UE receives the paging message in one of the RNA cells, it sends the RRCResumeRequest message to the gNodeB.
4. The gNodeB proceeds with the RRC Resume procedure.

## 3.3 RRC Connection Resume Procedures

The UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state initiates the RRC Resume procedure, if there is uplink

data or signaling, or it receives paging.

RRC Connection Resume

The UE can initiate the RRC Resume procedure for the following reasons:

- The UE needs to transmit uplink data or signaling.
- The UE receives RAN paging for downlink data or signaling.
- The UE initiates the RNA Update procedure.

The UE can resume to RRC\_CONNECTED state by sending the

RRCResumeRequest message to the gNodeB. Both the UE and the

gNodeB store all required configuration information.

During

the RRC Connection Resume procedure,

the

Fallback

to RRC Connection Establishment procedure is triggered by the gNodeB if the

NRCellDU.cellBarred attribute is set to

BARRED.

Figure 6   RRC Connection Resume

1. The UE sends the RRCResumeRequest message with short Inactive Radio Network Temporary Identifier (I-RNTI) and resumeMAC-I to the gNodeB.
2. The gNodeB retrieves the stored UE Inactive AS context based on the received I-RNTI and verifies the ResumeMAC-I.
3. The gNodeB sends the RRCResume message to the UE.
4. The UE sends the RRCResumeComplete message to the gNodeB.
5. The gNodeB starts to send and receive data or signaling.

If the RRC Resume procedure cannot be performed, the gNodeB performs

an

RRC Resume Fallback to RRC Connection Establishment procedure. The gNodeB initiates

an RRC Connection Establishment procedure for the following reasons:

- The gNodeB fails to retrieve the UE Inactive AS context.
- The last used ciphering and integrity algorithm is not supported.
- The selected slices (S-NSSAI) are only partially supported.
- The NR Cell Soft Lock feature is active in the target cell. Note: In this case, after the gNodeB receives the RRCSetupComplete message, the gNodeB sends the RRCRelease message to the UE.

RNA Update Procedure

The UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state can initiate RNA Update procedure if it leaves the RNA

or the Periodic RNA Update (RRC.t380) timer expires.

1. The UE sends the RRCResumeRequest with resumeCause=rnaUpdate to the gNodeB.
2. The gNodeB performs the RNA Update or releases the UE to RRC\_IDLE state depending on the configuration of the RrcInactiveProfileUeCfg.PeriodicRNAUpdateCount attribute:
    1. If the RrcInactiveProfileUeCfg.PeriodicRNAUpdateCount attribute is set to 0, the UE is always released to RRC\_INACTIVE state.
    2. If the RrcInactiveProfileUeCfg.PeriodicRNAUpdateCount attribute is set to 1, the UE is always released to RRC\_IDLE state.
    3. If the RrcInactiveProfileUeCfg.PeriodicRNAUpdateCount parameter is set to {2, 3, 4, 5}, the UE is released to RRC\_IDLE state after the last RNA update. Until the last RNA update, the UE is released to RRC\_INACTIVE state.

## 3.4 Handling of Inactive UE Context

The gNodeB releases the oldest Inactive UE AS contexts, when the number of RRC\_CONNECTED

and the RRC\_INACTIVE UEs reaches the supported capacity. By releasing UE Inactive AS

context, the gNodeB ensures, that there is sufficient capacity for incoming

connections.

All Inactive UE AS contexts are released and removed at node restart. Cell restart or

cell lock does not affect Inactive UE AS contexts.

# 4 Network Impact of RRC Inactive State

This feature reduces latency and signaling load.

Capacity and Performance

This feature decreases the latency with the introduction of RRC\_INACTIVE state. The

procedure to switch from RRC\_INACTIVE to RRC\_CONNECTED state involves less signaling

and message exchange between the UE and gNodeB then switching from RRC\_IDLE state.

Also, configuration is stored in both UE and gNodeB, which makes the switch between

the states quicker.

Other Network Elements

The AMF must support RRC\_INACTIVE state. Also, the AMF must provide Core Network

Assistance Information (CNAI) for the gNodeB.

The UE must support RRC\_INACTIVE state.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q2: Intra-gNodeB Inter-Capacity Module Resume

This feature enhancement allows the RRC Connection Resume procedure to work across

multiple Capacity Modules within the

gNodeB.

| Feature Name           | RRC Inactive State                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5328                                |
| Value Package Name     | Intelligent Traffic Management and Mobility |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4022                                |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                         |
| Access Type            | NR                                          |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, the RRC Inactive State feature supports the RRC

Connection Resume procedure without packet forwarding across multiple Capacity

Modules within the gNodeB.

When Inter-Capacity Module Resume is used, RRC signaling and latency for the UEs are

reduced.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement improves the following KPIs:

- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, RRC Inactive State
- DRB Retainability - Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, RRC Inactive State, gNodeB triggered only

The following PM and EBS counters are no longer pegged when Inter-Capacity Module

Resume is attempted:

- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalGnb5qi
- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalGnbInact5qi
- NRCellCU.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalGnbInact
- NRCellCU.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalGnb
- NRCellCU.pmPduSessionRelAbnormalGnb
- pmEbsDrbRelAbnormalGnb5qi
- pmEbsDrbRelAbnormalGnbInact5qi
- pmEbsPduSessionRelAbnormalGnb

The following PM counters are pegged less often:

- NRCellCU.pmRrcResumeAttFallback
- NRCellCU.pmRrcResumeSuccFallback

The following PM counters are pegged more often:

- NRCellCU.pmRrcResumeAttResume
- NRCellCU.pmRrcResumeSuccResume

Intra-gNodeB Inter-Capacity Module Resume causes packet loss if the resume procedure

is triggered by a packet from the 5G Core Network, because packet forwarding is not

supported.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
