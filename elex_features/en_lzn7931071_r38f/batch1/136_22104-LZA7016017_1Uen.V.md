# 1 Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band Overview

The feature boosts transmission power for specific messages on the PDCCH and the PDSCH,

improving coverage at initial access in EN-DC deployment.

Summary

The feature allows for higher TX power for each PRB of the PDCCH during initial access in a

Baseband unit by borrowing power from adjacent carriers on the radio.

The transmission power of the PDCCH is boosted on the PSCell by borrowing power from unused

carriers on the same PAAM or PAAM segment. This PDCCH boost targets the following

messages:

- Msg2
- Msg3 retransmission grant
- Msg4 grant
- Initial P2 refinement

The feature also boosts Msg2 on the PDSCH through the following adjustments:

- Power is borrowed from unused Msg2 PRBs.
- Transport block scaling is applied to achieve higher coding gain.
- The PRBs of the PDSCH are moved to the center.

As a result of the PDCCH and PDSCH coverage extension, the RACH procedure during NR initial

access is improved and Msg2 detection can be improved.

# 2 Dependencies of Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band

The feature boosts the PDCCH by borrowing power from unused carriers and the PDSCH by

borrowing power from unused Msg2 PRBs.

Figure 1   Power Boost During Initial Access

The feature allows for boosting the power of the PDCCH and the PDSCH at initial access

independently of each other. The power boost must be set for each PCell separately. The

following attributes are used to control the power boost on the PDCCH and the PDSCH:

- NRCellDU.pdcchRachBoost
- NRCellDU.pdschRachBoost

The achievable downlink power boost depends on the radio and Baseband unit configuration.

The following read-only attributes can be used to display how much boost is

achieved:

- NRCellDU.actualPdcchRachBoost
- NRCellDU.actualPdschRachBoost

The power boost can help with wide beam establishment. For more information, see Scheduler High-Band.
