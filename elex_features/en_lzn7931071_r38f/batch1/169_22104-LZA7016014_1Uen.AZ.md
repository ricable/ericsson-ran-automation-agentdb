Summary

The feature detects breaks in the cables connected to radio units by measuring return loss as

the ratio of transmitted and reflected power. The VSWR Over Threshold

alarm is raised if return loss is below the configured VSWR sensitivity value, or if

cable disconnection at radio side is detected.

The feature offers the benefit of detecting faults in the antenna system.

The

Return Loss Antenna

Supervision

feature

serves the same purpose as the VSWR Antenna Supervision feature, but

it

is applicable to radio units that do not

contain

components for VSWR

measurements.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Return Loss Antenna Supervision

The feature supervises return loss and raises an alarm if the measured value is below

the

sensitivity

set in the vswrSupervisionSensitivity

attribute.

The feature uses RfPort MO attributes for

single band radio units, and FreqBandData MO attributes for multiband

radio units.

The feature can be activated on RF ports that support measurements of reflected power in

the radio unit. The feature only applies to TX branches.

Return loss is the ratio of transmitted and reflected power. Equation for VSWR and Return Loss shows the relationship between VSWR

and return loss.

Equation for VSWR and Return Loss

VSWR = (1+10^(-RL/20))/(1-10^(-RL/20))

Operational Process

1. The node measures return loss on downlink RF ports that transmit power. Note: Return loss values outside the configurable range of the vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute are considered unreliable. The node disregards such values.
2. The node calculates and filters the average return loss values to reduce variance and the risk of false alarms. This might result in variable response time. The maximum response time is 10 minutes.
3. If return loss is below the sensitivity set in the vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute, the node generates artificial load to increase the accuracy of return loss measurements. Artificial load does not affect UE load.
4. After validating the previously measured values, the node pauses return loss measurements for 15 minutes. The validation interval is not configurable by users.
5. The vswrValue attribute and the corresponding PM counters are updated.
6. If return loss is below the sensitivity set in the vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute, the VSWR Over Threshold alarm is raised.Note: In low-traffic conditions, the alarm might be raised only after the traffic load increases.

On-Demand Readout of Return Loss

When the radio unit supports VSWR, the node measures return loss continuously. Using

the get command on the vswrValue attribute

returns the following details:

- The latest return loss value
- The time stamp of the latest measurement

If the number of measurements is insufficient to guarantee the accuracy, the

attribute returns the Insufficient RL readings above Screening

Threshold warning.

The repeatability of measurements is a more accurate indicator than the absolute

values. On-demand readout is suitable for detecting the deterioration of the antenna

system over time.

To ensure more accurate measurements in the long term, return loss values over 18 dB

are discarded and cannot be read out. This applies to the following MOM objects:

- pmReturnLoss
- vswrValue

## 3.1 Supervision Sensitivity for Return Loss Antenna Supervision

Supervision sensitivity is specified as the value of the

vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute. Supervision sensitivity implies

different absolute dB values depending on the radio unit.

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The MO corresponding to the radio unit is configured. Table 5 Managed Objects for Configuring the Feature Radio Unit Type Corresponding MO Single band radio units RfPort Multiband radio units FreqBandData

Steps

1. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012024 MO instance. Note: The Feature Resource Missing alarm might be raised under the following conditions: The feature license is missing. The feature license is inoperable. The feature license is deactivated. The radio unit does not support the feature.
2. Set the desired supervision sensitivity as the value of the vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute. For more information on calculating the desired supervision sensitivity, see Configure the Supervision Sensitivity.
3. Set the value of the vswrSupervisionActive attribute to true to enable the feature.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Return Loss Antenna Supervision

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The MO corresponding to the radio unit is configured. Table 6 Managed Objects for Configuring the Feature Radio Unit Type Corresponding MO Single band radio units RfPort Multiband radio units FreqBandData

Steps

1. Set the value of the vswrSupervisionActive attribute to false to disable the feature.
2. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012024 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Return Loss Antenna Supervision

Supervision sensitivity is configured using the

vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute.

The feature uses RfPort MO attributes for

single band radio units, and FreqBandData MO attributes for multiband

radio units.

To ensure that the VSWR Over Threshold Alarm is raised, the value of the

RfPort.administrativeState attribute must be set to

UNLOCKED.

Configuring the Supervision Sensitivity

Supervision sensitivity is configured using the

vswrSupervisionSensitivity attribute in the MO corresponding

to the radio unit.

Users must consider the following factors when configuring the supervision

sensitivity:

- If the sensitivity is too high, false alarms might be raised.
- If the sensitivity is too low, the reflected power might become too low because of the attenuation.
