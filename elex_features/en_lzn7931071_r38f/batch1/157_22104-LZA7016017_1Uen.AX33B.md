# 1 NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Overview

This feature divides the geographic area of a sector into eight horizontal segments.

Each horizontal segment corresponds to a direction. In each direction, a dedicated EMF

controller keeps the time-averaged and normalized EIRP below a configured threshold to help

meet EMF regulatory requirements.

Summary

This feature helps operators comply with EMF regulatory requirements with minimal impact on

the throughput of the sector carrier. The time-averaged and normalized EIRP is

monitored separately in each direction, and the momentary power is reduced in the

sector carrier only when the calculated time-averaged and normalized EIRP approaches

the configured threshold in one of the directions.

Each direction has its own dedicated EMF controller function, which is responsible for keeping

the time-averaged and normalized EIRP below the configured threshold. The EMF

controller function is the same as in the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature.

The thresholds of the directions are configured separately, and operators can set different

values for each direction. If the time-averaged and normalized EIRP approaches the

threshold in one direction, the momentary power is reduced in the whole sector by

limiting the number of PRBs in the PDSCH.

Compared to the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, this feature maintains the time-averaged and

normalized EIRP below the respective threshold in each direction and allows

operators to configure different thresholds in different directions, resulting in

less impact on the performance of the sector carrier.

Hardware

The feature is supported on Massive MIMO radio units with eCPRI and radio units with

8TX/8RX antenna configuration.

Limitations

The feature only supports certain combinations of coverage shapes and antenna

configurations. Table 2 lists the

supported coverage shapes for each antenna configuration.

Table 2   Supported Coverage Shapes for Each Antenna Configuration

|           | Product_default   | Macro   | Hotspot   | Highrise   | Street Coverage   |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-----------|------------|-------------------|

| 16TX/RX   | No                | No      | No        | No         | Yes               |
| 32TX/32RX | No                | Yes     | Yes       | Yes        | No                |
| 64TX/64RX | No                | Yes     | Yes       | Yes        | No                |

For this feature, antennas with column spacing in the range of 0.44-0.56 λ must be

used on 8TX/8RX radio units. For antennas with column spacing outside the 0.44-0.56

λ range, the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature is recommended.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

Interaction between the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

Feature and Advanced Beamforming Features

For the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature to operate

correctly with the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band and Advanced Downlink

Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band features, CSI-RS needs to be configured for 32 ports.

Otherwise, either the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature or

the Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band and Advanced Downlink Multi-User

MIMO Mid-Band features must be disabled.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

The feature divides the geographic area of a sector into eight directions. The

time-averaged and normalized EIRP is controlled in each direction to comply with the

operator-defined thresholds, with minimal impact on the performance of the sector

carrier.

In each direction, a dedicated EMF controller keeps the time-averaged and normalized EIRP

below the threshold of that direction. If the time-averaged and normalized EIRP

approaches the configured threshold in any direction, the momentary power is reduced in

the sector carrier. This is achieved by limiting the number of PRBs in the PDSCH, which

leaves the SSB, the CSI-RS, and the PDCCH unaffected.

The time-averaged and normalized EIRP for each direction is calculated considering the

following factors:

- The antenna gains of the broadcast beam
- The antenna gains of the traffic beams in each direction
- The side lobe contribution of a traffic beam, where the main beam is directed elsewhere
- The power split between different MIMO layers in different angular regions
- The power reduction due to massive MIMO sleep mode

For each direction the time-averaged and normalized EIRP is calculated the following

way:

```
Where:
i=1,2, ..., 8,is the index for the eight directions
Ωirepresents each of the eight directions
θ is the zenith angle
Φ is the azimuth angle
EIRPavg(θ,Φ) is the time-averaged EIRP in the angle
EIRPevlp(θ,Φ) is calculated by multiplying the envelope of antenna radiation patterns for traffic beams (Gevlp(θ,Φ)) and the maximum configured power
```

Equation 1   Time-Averaged EIRP Normalized to Maximum EIRP

The EMF controller function forms a continuous loop, which consists of control steps of

EIRP calculations and power control. The EMF controller continuously calculates the

momentary normalized EIRP and the time-averaged and normalized EIRP, and if necessary,

limits the momentary power.

Figure 1   EMF Controller Operational Flow

1. In each direction, the RAN Compute unit calculates the momentary normalized EIRP transmitted by the radio.
2. In each direction, the RAN Compute unit calculates the time-averaged and normalized EIRP. The averaging time is set using the PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirAvgTime attribute, which is the same for all directions. The length of the averaging time is to be set according to local EMF regulatory requirements. The averaging time defines the length of the sliding window, which holds a set of previously taken samples of the momentary normalized EIRP. At each control step, the latest sample of the momentary normalized EIRP is added to the sliding window, while the oldest sample is discarded.
3. In each direction, the time-averaged and normalized EIRP is measured against the threshold of that direction. The thresholds for each direction can be set using the PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh attribute.
4. If the time-averaged and normalized EIRP approaches the threshold in any direction, the momentary power is limited in the whole sector carrier to keep the time-averaged and normalized EIRP below the threshold in that direction.

## 3.1 Direction Mapping for NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

The NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature maps UEs to eight

directions in the sector.

With the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, a sector is divided

into eight directions. UEs are mapped to at least one of the eight directions, and the

EMF controller of each direction is responsible for monitoring the time-averaged and

normalized EIRP in that direction. The

PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh attribute consists of eight

struct members, one for each direction. The directions are distributed on the horizontal

plane as shown in Figure 2 and described in

Table 3.

Figure 2   Sector Divided into Eight Directions

Table 3   Directions and Their Corresponding Angles and Struct Members

| Direction   | Struct Member          |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Direction 1 | powerBackoffDirThresh1 |
| Direction 2 | powerBackoffDirThresh2 |
| Direction 3 | powerBackoffDirThresh3 |
| Direction 4 | powerBackoffDirThresh4 |
| Direction 5 | powerBackoffDirThresh5 |
| Direction 6 | powerBackoffDirThresh6 |
| Direction 7 | powerBackoffDirThresh7 |
| Direction 8 | powerBackoffDirThresh8 |

## 3.2 Comparison of the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature and NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature

Compared to the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, using the NR Directional Control for

EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature has less or no impact on the performance of the sector

carrier. This results in better throughput while the time-averaged and normalized EIRP is

maintained below the configured thresholds.

Using the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature

With the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, the time-averaged and normalized power is

kept below the configured threshold in the sector carrier. The threshold, which is

configured with the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute,

determines what fraction of the maximum configured power can be used for

time-averaged power. The maximum configured power is configured with the

NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute.

For example, with a 25% threshold and a maximum configured power of 200 W, the

time-averaged transmitted power is kept below 50 W in the sector carrier, regardless

of reported PMIs, or whether codebook-based beamforming or advanced beamforming is

used.

Using the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature

With the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, the geographic

area of the sector is divided into eight directions. In each direction, the

threshold is configured with the

PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh attribute. The

time-averaged and normalized EIRP is kept below the threshold, and if the power

control is triggered in one direction, the momentary power is reduced in the whole

sector carrier.

Example 1

If the reported PMIs from UEs are evenly mapped among the directions, UEs only use

one-layer MIMO transmission, and the total power is evenly distributed among the UEs

as shown in Figure 3. If the TDD downlink

duty cycle is 0.75, the time-averaged and normalized EIRP in one direction is

roughly 0.75/8 = 0.094. The accurate time-averaged and normalized EIRP level

calculated in the EMF controller is slightly higher than 0.094, because it includes

the side lobe contributions from beams towards other directions. If the threshold is

25% in all directions, the power control is not triggered as the time-averaged and

normalized EIRP level calculated in any direction is below the 25%

threshold.

Figure 3   Reported PMIs from UEs Are Evenly Distributed

Example 2

If reported PMIs from UEs are unevenly mapped among the directions, the time-averaged

and normalized EIRP might approach the threshold in the direction with the most

usage, triggering power control. If the TDD downlink duty cycle is 0.75, and the

thresholds are 25% in all directions, with a 50% usage in direction 8, as shown in

Figure 4, the power control is then to

be triggered in the sector carrier to keep the time-averaged and normalized EIRP

below the threshold in direction 8.

Figure 4   Reported PMIs from UEs Are Unevenly Distributed

Example 3

Power control might not be triggered by the direction with a larger threshold, even

if most usage occurs in that direction. If the TDD downlink duty cycle is 0.75, the

threshold is 100% in direction 8, and the thresholds in other directions are all

25%, then even with 50% usage in direction 8, as shown in Figure 4, the time-averaged and normalized

EIRP is below the threshold in direction 8. Therefore, the power control is not

triggered.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

Reducing the momentary power to keep the time-averaged and normalized EIRP below the

thresholds in every direction might result in reduced throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The momentary power is reduced when the time-averaged EIRP approaches the configured

threshold in a direction. This might result in reduced throughput in the sector

carrier, however, the power reduction is achieved by limiting the number of PRBs in

PDSCH, which leaves the SSB, the CSI-RS, and the PDCCH unaffected.

The less evenly distributed the UEs are across the directions, the more likely the

momentary power of the sector carrier has to be reduced to keep the time-averaged

and normalized EIRP below the threshold in the direction with the most traffic.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

| PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh  | Introduced | See MOM description.  This attribute consists of eight struct members and each member                                 corresponds to a direction. The threshold must be configured for                                 each direction, and they can take different values.  Setting a higher threshold for a direction can result in less power                                 reduction, which improves the throughput in the sector carrier.  Setting a lower threshold for a direction can result in more frequent                                 power reductions, which affects the throughput of the whole sector                                 carrier.

- The SectorEquipmentFunction.operationalState attribute, which is referenced from the appropriate NRSectorCarrier MO, is set to ENABLED.
- The SectorEquipmentFunction.availabilityStatus attribute, which is referenced from the appropriate NRSectorCarrier MO, is empty.
- No PowerBackoff MO instance is created under the same NRSectorCarrier MO instance.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Create a PowerBackoffDir MO instance under the appropriate NRSectorCarrier MO instance. Note: The PowerBackoffDir MO attributes are restricted. This means that they can only be set when the MO instance is created. To change the attributes, the MO instance must be deleted and recreated. This is done to limit the risk of accidental changes of the attributes that could cause the violation of the EMF regulations. None of the attribute changes take effect until the next sector carrier unlock.
3. Set the PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirEnabled attribute to true.
4. Set the PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirAvgTime attribute to the preferred value.
5. Set the PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh attribute to the preferred value.
6. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

The feature is configured on the sector carrier level. A

PowerBackoffDir MO instance is created under the applicable

NRSectorCarrier MO instance.

Restrictions

The attributes of the PowerBackoffDir MO are restricted, which

means that they can only be set when the MO instance is created.

The PowerBackoffDir MO instance cannot be created as long as a

PowerBackoff MO instance exists under the same

NRSectorCarrier.

The lowest value of the PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh

attribute that can be set is 23.4%. Even if the value is set lower than 23.4%, the

value 23.4% is used.

The feature only supports certain combinations of coverage shapes and antenna

configurations. Table 7 lists the

supported coverage shapes for each antenna configuration.

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 23.Q4: Enhanced Direction Mapping and PDCCH Beamforming for Directional Control for EMF Power Lock

The calculation of transmitted power is improved, which can lead to less frequent

power reductions. The feature enhancement also introduces support to use the directional

power lock function with PDCCH beamforming.

|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5500                                         |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                                            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The UEs scheduled for advanced beamforming are mapped to certain directions instead of all directions. This can lead to increased downlink throughput.
- PDCCH beamforming is supported with the directional power lock function.

The contribution of radiated power related to UEs that are scheduled with advanced

beamforming can be estimated more accurately. The UEs scheduled for advanced

beamforming are mapped to one or several directions according to the reported PMI.

This is valid only for single-user MIMO. Depending on several conditions, the UEs

are either mapped to the direction they are in or to the direction they are in and

the adjacent directions. A direction is one of the eight subdivisions of the

geographical area of a sector carrier that is used by the feature.

In previous releases, UEs scheduled for advanced beamforming are mapped to all

directions. Because the power contributions related to such UEs are not accumulated

for every direction, the power lock function of the feature might be activated less

frequently with this feature enhancement.

The downlink throughput can increase if the transmitted power is reduced less

frequently. The increase in throughput depends on the traffic load and the number of

UEs scheduled for advanced beamforming in the sector carrier.

With the feature enhancement, PDCCH beamforming can be used with the directional

power lock function. This is achieved by mapping the total transmitted power

contribution of PDCCH beamforming to all directions used by the NR Directional

Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature. This is a new feature interaction

between the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature and the

Coverage- and Capacity-Optimized PDCCH Beamforming feature.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink throughput can increase depending on the number of UEs scheduled for

advanced beamforming.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces a new PM event parameter for the

DuPerSectorCarrierDirEmfPwrCtrl event.

The feature enhancement introduces the following counters to observe the distribution

of time-averaged transmitted power for each direction for each control step:

- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir1Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir2Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir3Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir4Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir5Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir6Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir7Distr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDir8Distr

The feature introduces the

NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfPwrBackoffStepPwrDirDistr counter to

observe the distribution of the total time-averaged transmitted power relative to

the maximum transmitted power for each control step in the sector.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

feature is moved to the NR Base Package and becomes a non-license-controlled

feature.

The feature enhancement introduces support for 8TX/8RX and 16TX/16RX radio units for

the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature. It also introduces

support for hotspot and highrise coverage shapes for 64TX/64RX and 32TX/32RX radio

units for the feature.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces support for more values of the

CommonBeamforming.coverageShape attribute for the

feature.

The NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfResourceAllowedDir PM counter is

deprecated and the

NRSectorCarrier.pmEmfResourceAllowedNormalizedDir PM counter

is introduced.

The feature enhancement introduces the coverageShape=&lt;value&gt; not

supported by equipment represented by MO in Additional Information when feature

NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band is enabled

additional text for the MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment

alarm.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature is not supported on

16TX/16RX radio units in the current release.

For the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, antennas with

column spacing in the range of 0.44-0.56 λ must be used on 8TX/8RX radio units. For

antennas with column spacing outside the 0.44-0.56 λ range, the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature is recommended.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
