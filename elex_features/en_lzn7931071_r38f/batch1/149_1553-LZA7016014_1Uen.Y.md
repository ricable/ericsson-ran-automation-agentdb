# 1 Introduction to Manual RAN Software Upgrade

Manual Software Upgrade requires the user to prepare, install, and activate the

software.

RAN software upgrade is the end-to-end process of upgrading the software on a batch of

nodes in a network. In this method of upgrade, the software preparation, installation,

and activation are performed by the user. These actions are performed using ENM

applications.

Soft Upgrade and Hard Upgrade

A software upgrade can be a soft upgrade or a hard upgrade. A soft upgrade tries to

hand over ongoing traffic to neighbor cells during the upgrade. A hard upgrade does

not try to hand over ongoing traffic to neighbor cells during the upgrade. Soft

upgrade has a longer duration than hard upgrade because of the traffic handover

attempt.

Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart

This upgrade method provides shorter service downtime as a result of reduced upgrade

and restart time in cases where the software delta is limited to LTE, NR, or radio

unit, and there is no MOM change.

For more information, see Software Upgrade with System Adaptive

Restart.

Feature and MOM Delta

The latest NIR of the applicable Radio Access Technology contains more information

about changes in software and new features. The Compare content with another library

version function in ELEX can be used to track changes in software and features

between current and previous releases.

For detailed information about the delta between different software versions, such as

parameters, alarms, and counters, see Lists and Delta Lists - Referral Document.

## 1.1 First Implementation and Roll-Out

First implementation involves the introduction of new software in a live network, in

a small number of selected nodes to ensure the proper implementation of the software.

Roll-out is the activity of upgrading the software for an entire network.

To make the upgrade as streamlined as possible, parameters and customer specifications

are also refined during first implementation.

The results of a successful first implementation are documented in the Method of

Procedure. This includes information such as known faults, troubleshooting guides, and

parameter changes.

The first implementation also includes the monitoring of KPI and any alarms from the

newly installed software. The duration of monitoring varies from an eight-hour to a

one-week period, based on network requirements.

The roll-out activities are similar procedures as the first implementation. It is

recommended to perform the software preparation and installation activities outside of

the maintenance window and the software activation inside the maintenance window.

## 1.2 Verification

Verification consists of software verification in a lab environment and the

validation of output files such as ROP, parameters differences, alarms, and counters.

Third-party tools must be tested during verification.

The results of verification activities can provide valuable input and experience for

first implementation and rollout. While it is recommended to perform verification

activities during preparation, it is not mandatory.

Ericsson recommends the following verification activities before software upgrade:

- Verification of upgrade activities and the upgrade path
- Verification of hardware configuration with new software
- Functionality, O&amp;M, and robustness regression tests
- Verification of third-party tools and northbound systems
- Validation of system constants and other parameter changes
- Health checks with the appropriately set input and output parameters in the PRE\_INSTALL and PRE\_UPGRADE configuration options.

## 1.3 Recommended Timing for Upgrade Activities

Ericsson recommends specific timing for the upgrade activities.

Table 1   Timing Recommendations for Upgrade Activities

| Activity                              | Recommended Timing                             |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Prerequisites                         | Starting day of the upgrade activities         |
| Software preparation and installation | During daytime (outside of maintenance window) |
| Software activation                   | During nighttime                               |
| Node monitoring                       | The day after the completion of the upgrade    |

## 1.4 Manual Software Update Application Scope

Supported hardware and RATs must be verified when planning the Manual Software

Upgrade.

Table 2   Manual Software Upgrade Application Scope

| Hardware            | Supported RATs                                 | Health Checks                                                                                                               |

# 3 Prepare for Manual Software Upgrade in ENM

A number of preparation activities must be completed in ENM before the manual

software upgrade.

Preparation to manual software upgrade include the following tasks:

Steps

1. Import License Key File into ENM
2. Import Software Package into ENM
3. Create Node Collection in ENM
4. Create Health Check Profile

## 3.1 Import License Key File into ENM

Import the License Key File (LKF) to enable new features and functionality on the

node, or to enable increased node capacity.

If Instantaneous Licensing in connected mode is

used, the LKF

can be requested using Upgrade License Keys in SHM or from

the

node.

In this case,

the LKF is automatically imported into

ENM.

If Instantaneous Licensing in the non-connected mode is used, the

LKF is

requested

using SSP-LKM

and is manually imported into

ENM.

For more information about the LKF handling, see Instantaneous Licensing Solution

Guideline.

# 6 Fallback Activities in ENM

The fallback plan is a set of actions and tasks that are available if the software

upgrade is not successful.

During the first implementation the fallback plan contains the following fallback

criteria:

- The software upgrade activities cannot be completed within the maintenance window.
- Basic node functions (such as call handling and handover) are not operational. The fault remains and cannot be resolved by troubleshooting in the maintenance window.
- The node is not synchronized to ENM after the software upgrade is completed. The fault remains and cannot be resolved by troubleshooting in the maintenance window.

Multiple attempts are allowed for software upgrade within the maintenance window. If any

of the attempts succeed, the first implementation is considered successful.

When a fault is encountered on a basic function, the first recommended action is

troubleshooting instead of immediate fallback.

## 6.1 Rollback Node in ENM

The purpose of this activity is to perform a rollback on a node to a backup created

before software installation. This activity is only required, if KPI degradation is observed

during node monitoring.

Prerequisites

A node collection for the nodes that are selected for rollback must be created. For

more information, see Create Node Collection in ENM.

Steps

1. Launch the Software and Hardware Manager from the Provisioning section of the Application Launcher.
