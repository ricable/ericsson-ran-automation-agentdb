Summary

The feature provides Layer 3 firewall functionality for ingress and egress traffic on IP

interfaces.

The operator can use this functionality to prevent unwanted or malicious traffic from

entering the node, and to prevent traffic from unintentionally exiting the node through an

interface towards a foreign network domain.

# 3 Feature Operation of Access Control Lists

The feature provides configurable firewall protection of ingress and egress traffic at

external IPv4/IPv6 interfaces.

Traffic Filtering

Traffic can be classified and filtered based on 8-tuple filters:

- Destination IPv4/IPv6 address
- DSCP
- Fragment type
- ICMP type
- Protocol
- Source IPv4/IPv6 address
- UDP, TCP, or SCTP destination port
- UDP, TCP, or SCTP source port

The node supports stateless filtering of fragments as specified in RFC 1858, section

2. This means that filtering on the L4 contents is only done for the initial

fragment for IPv6 protocol, and for ACL entries with L4 filters. ACL entries with L4 filters

are port numbers or ICMP types.

For non-initial fragments, filtering is done only on the L3 contents.

By configuring the fragment type filter, it is also possible to setup-specific ACL entries

that filter based on the type of fragment.

Traffic is automatically permitted for the following:

- ACL IPv6
- NDP
- MLD

Access Control Lists

When ACL processes a packet, the entries in the ACL are evaluated against the packet in

sequential priority order. If an entry matches, the action specified in the entry is applied

to the packet, and evaluation ends. The action can be either permit or

deny.

Filtering can be configured individually for each interface and direction.

# 6 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
