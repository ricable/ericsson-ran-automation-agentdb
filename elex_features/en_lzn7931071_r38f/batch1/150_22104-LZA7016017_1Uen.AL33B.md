deployments.

## 3.1 Feature Operation of NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation

This feature supports UE overheating mitigation using the UAI procedure.

With the help of the standardized UAI procedure, UE preferences are sent to the network

to affect the network configuration of the UE. The feature uses the UAI procedure to

handle UE overheating in an EN-DC deployment. Only the SCG configuration preferences of

the UE are supported with this feature.

The MCG preferences are ignored.

Operational Process

Figure 1   NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation Operation

1. The UAI configuration for UE overheating is handled by the Master Node. The configuration is based on the UE capabilities and the configuration of the ENodeBFunction.endcOverheatingAssistance attribute.
2. When the UE experiences internal overheating, it sends a UAI overheating report to the network. The decision to mitigate the overheating is made by the network when handling the overheating report received in the LTE RRC UEAssistanceInformation message.
3. The UE can indicate whether the UE is overheating or the overheating condition is mitigated.
4. The received overheating report is handled by the Master Node and the Secondary Node.

### 3.1.1 UAI Configuration for UE Overheating Mitigation with EN-DC Configuration

The UAI overheating mitigation configuration is controlled by the Master Node in an

EN-DC deployment.

Prerequisites for UAI Configuration

The UAI is configured for UE overheating mitigation if all the following conditions

are met:

- The ENodeBFunction.endcOverheatingAssistance attribute is set to true.
- The UE supports the following UAI overheating indications: overheatingInd-r14 overheatingIndForSCG-r16
- The UE is EN-DC configured with SCG.

The Master Node configures the UE to report

overheatingAssistance-r14 and

overheatingAssistanceForSCG-r16.

The previously configured UAI is released at LTE RRC reestablishment.

UAI Configuration at Secondary Node Addition, SCG Addition and Secondary Node

Release

At any Secondary Node addition or SCG Addition, a new UAI configuration is triggered

by the network.

At any Secondary Node release, the previously configured UAI is released.

UAI Configuration at SCG Release due to Overheating

If the SCG release is due to overheating, the network triggers the release of the

overheatingAssistanceForSCG-r16 overheating indication,

while the overheatingAssistance-r14 overheating indication is

kept.

If the SCG release is not caused by overheating, the network triggers the release of

the whole UAI configuration.

UAI Configuration at Master Node Mobility

The previously configured UAI is released in case of LTE handover with Secondary Node

release or LTE handover without PSCell change.

UAI Configuration at Secondary Node Mobility

The PSCell change procedure does not affect the UAI configuration.

### 3.1.2 UAI Overheating Report from the UE with EN-DC Configuration

When the UE experiences internal overheating, the UE sends the LTE RRC

UEAssistanceInformation message with the following indications:

- overheatingAssistance-r14Note: In case of overheatingAssistance-r14 indication, the reducedMaxCCs and reducedUE-Category preferences are not supported or they are ignored.
- overheatingAssistanceForSCG-r16

If prohibit timer T345 is not running, the UE sends a new UAI message to the network if

the last indicated preferences change.

Indicating Overheating Condition

When the UE experiences overheating, it can request one of the following actions from

the network:

- Reduce the number of SCells in component carriers (reducedMaxCCs) or bandwidth (reducedMaxBW-FR1 or reducedMaxBW-FR2) on the SCG. Table 2 SCell Deactivation during UAI Overheating reducedMaxCCs reducedMaxBW-FR1 or reducedMaxBW-FR2 reducedCCsDL ˃ 0 reducedBW-DL ˃ 0 reducedCCsUL ˃ 0 reducedBW-UL ˃ 0
- Setting SCG release preference according to the following table: Table 3 SCG Release Preference during UAI Overheating reducedMaxCCs reducedMaxBW-FR1 or reducedMaxBW-FR2 reducedCCsDL = 0 reducedBW-DL = 0 reducedCCsUL = 0 reducedBW-UL = 0 The UE might include the following indications and possible combinations: reducedMaxCCs reducedMaxBW-FR1 reducedMaxBW-FR2 reducedMaxCCs with reducedMaxBW-FR1 reducedMaxCCs with reducedMaxBW-FR2

Indicating Overheating Condition Mitigated

If the overheating condition is mitigated, the UE sends one of the following LTE RRC

UEAssistanceInformation messages:

- An empty overheatingAssistance-r14 indication is included in the LTE RRC UEAssistanceInformation message with one of the following IEs indicated: An overheatingAssistance-v1610 indication is not included in the UEAssistanceInformation-v1610 IEs. An UEAssistanceInformation-v1610 IEs are not included in the UEAssistanceInformation-v1530 IEs. UEAssistanceInformation-v1530 IEs are not included in UEAssistanceInformation-v1450 IEs.
- An empty overheatingAssistance-r14 indication is not included in the LTE RRC UEAssistanceInformation message, but one of the following IEs is indicated: An overheatingAssistance-v1610 indication is not included in the UEAssistanceInformation-v1610 IEs. An UEAssistanceInformation-v1610 IEs are not included in the UEAssistanceInformation-v1530 IEs. UEAssistanceInformation-v1530 IEs are not included in UEAssistanceInformation-v1450 IEs.

### 3.1.3 Handling the Received UAI Overheating Report with EN-DC Configuration

The UAI overheating report is handled by the Master Node and the Secondary

Node.

The Master Node is responsible for handling the received report from the UE and

triggering the right actions based on the indicated UE preferences. One of the following

actions can be triggered:

- Triggering SCG release
- Triggering B1 measurement for SCG addition
- Forwarding the UAI report from the UE to the Secondary Node

The forwarding is done by the Secondary Node Modification procedure.

If the UAI report is received, the Secondary Node performs one of the following

actions:

- Deactivating the SCells in the SCG
- Reactivating the SCells in the SCG

#### 3.1.3.1 Master Node Handling of the Received UAI Overheating Report

Validating the Received UAI Report

The Master Node considers the received UAI overheating report valid if all the

following conditions apply:

- The UAI is configured for the UE before receiving the overheating report
- The overheating report contains at least one of the following IEs: reducedMaxCCs reducedMaxBW-FR1 reducedMaxBW-FR2 Note: The report can contain other IEs for overheating, but the network only supports the IEs mentioned above.

If the received UAI overheating report contains a preference for both SCG release and

SCell reduction (for example, reducedMaxCCs = 0 and

reducedMaxBW &gt; 0), the MeNodeB will release the SCG, as

it is prioritized over SCell reduction.

If the received UAI overheating report is not valid, it is discarded.

If the received UAI overheating report is valid, the Master Node checks it for the

following UE indications:

- Overheating Condition
- Overheating Condition Mitigated

Overheating Condition

The UAI overheating state is stored in the UAI container, replacing the previously

stored messages.

If the UE indicates SCG release as preference, the Master Node triggers the SCG

release.

If the SCG is released due to UE overheating, performing the B1 measurement

configuration or the buffer-based EN-DC setup is not allowed until the overheating

is mitigated.

Figure 2   SCell Release Due to Overheating

If the UE indicates SCell reduction or reduced aggregated bandwidth, the UAI

container is forwarded to the Secondary Node through the X2AP SGNB

MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the

cg-ConfigInfo{MRDC-AssistanceInfo{overheatingAssistanceSCG}}.

In case of an inter-gNodeB PSCell change, the Master Node forwards the stored last

received UAI report as a newly received UAI message over the X2 interface to the

target Secondary Node.

Overheating Condition Mitigated

When the mitigation is complete, the overheating state is updated to mitigated.

If EN-DC is configured with SCG, the UAI container is forwarded to the Secondary Node

through the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the

cg-ConfigInfo{empty overheatingAssistanceSCG}.

If EN-DC is configured without SCG, the buffer-based EN-DC setup function is

used.

If enabled, and the Master Node receives the X2AP SGNB ACTIVITY

NOTIFICATION message with the Inactive value, B1 measurements do not

start the adding of SCG resources.

If enabled, and the Master Node does not receive the X2AP SGNB ACTIVITY

NOTIFICATION message with the Inactive value, or it is disabled, B1

measurements start the adding of SCG resources.

The UAI configuration is also released to avoid any unnecessary UAI messages.

Figure 3   SCell Addition after Overheating Mitigation

#### 3.1.3.2 Secondary Node Handling of the Received UAI Overheating Report

Validating the Received UAI Report

The Secondary Node validates the received overheating report if it contains at least

one of the following IEs:

- reducedMaxCCs
- reducedMaxBW-FR1
- reducedMaxBW-FR2

The received overheating report is discarded in the following cases:

- The reducedMaxBW-FRx IE is different than the PSCell configuration
- The reducedMaxBW-FRx IE is less than the bandwidth of the PSCell
- The UE is indicating SCG release preference during UAI overheating

Handling of the Received UAI Container in Secondary Node

The following happens if the received overheating report is indicating SCell

reduction or reduced aggregated bandwidth:

- All active SCells are deactivated
- Activation of SCells is not allowed

The following happens if the received overheating report indicates overheating

condition mitigated:

- Activation of SCells is allowed again

In Low-Band and Mid-Band, the SCells are activated based on the buffer status and

coverage status. For further details, see the following documents:

- NR DL Carrier Aggregation
- Data-Aware Carrier Management

In High-Band, the SCells are activated if the PSCell capacity is not sufficient to

serve the required downlink or uplink data. For further details, see the following

documents:

- Dynamic Component Carrier Management
- NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band
- NR 8CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band
- NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band

Activation and Deactivation of SCells

If the UE reports an overheating condition, all active SCells are deactivated. SCell

activation is not allowed until the overheating condition is mitigated.

In case of an intra-gNodeB PSCell change, SCell activation is not allowed in the

target NR cell until the overheating condition is mitigated.

Figure 4   SCell Deactivation Due to Overheating

If the UE reports that the overheating condition is mitigated, SCells can be

activated using legacy behavior for all NR Bands.

Figure 5   SCell Reactivation after Overheating Mitigation

## 3.2 Feature Operation with NR-DC Configuration

With the help of the standardized UAI procedure, UE preferences are sent to the

network to affect the network configuration of the UE.

In case of NR-DC configurations, the configured UE advises the network to reduce

temporarily the maximum number of component carriers or bandwidth on the MCG, the SCG,

or both when experiencing internal overheating.

Based on the advice from the UE, the network performs one of the following actions:

- Deactivating SCells in the MCG, SCG, or both
- Releasing the SCG

Once the overheating is mitigated, the network performs one of the following actions:

- Reactivating SCells in the MCG, SCG, or both
- Setting up the SCG

The network controls the frequency of the overheating reports.

Operational Process in NR-DC

Figure 6   NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation Operation

1. The UAI configuration for UE overheating is handled by the Master Node. The configuration is based on the UE capabilities and the configuration of the UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingAssistanceConfig attribute.
2. When the UE detects internal overheating, it triggers a UAI overheating report for the network, and requests actions to be taken. The decision to mitigate the overheating is made by the network when handling the overheating report received in the NR RRC UEAssistanceInformation message.
3. The UE can indicate whether the UE is overheating or the overheating condition is mitigated. Note: UE is overheating if either reducedMaxBW-FR1, reducedMaxBW-FR2, or reducedMaxCCs, or all of these three indications are received.
4. The received overheating report is handled by the Master Node. If the received overheating report contains information for High-Band, the Master Node transfers the information to the Secondary Node that handles High-Band preferences.

### 3.2.1 UAI Configuration for UE Overheating Mitigation with NR-DC Configuration

The UAI is configured for UE overheating mitigation if all the following prerequisites

are met:

- The UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingAssistanceConfig attribute is set to true.
- The UE is capable of the overheatingInd UAI overheating indication.

The Master Node configures the UE to report OtherConfig-v1540.

The value of the UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingIndProhibitTimer attribute

to be sent is determined by UE group profile.

If all the prerequisites are met, the Master Node sends the

RRCReconfiguration message to the UE.

The UAI configuration is reconfigured for the target cell at handover.

### 3.2.2 UAI Overheating Report Process with NR-DC Configuration

The mitigation action depends on the overheating indication received in the UAI

overheating report that the UE sent.

UAI Overheating Report from the UE

Internal overheating of the UE triggers the NR RRC

UEAssistanceInformation message with the

overheatingAssistance IE contained in the

UEAssistanceInformation-v1540-IEs indication.

The UE sends a UAI message to the network if the following conditions are

fulfilled:

- Prohibit timer T345, with the value of the overheatingIndicationProhibitTimer IE, is not running at UE
- Change in the last indicated preferences

Figure 7   SCell Deactivation because of Overheating in Low-Band and Mid-Band

Figure 8   SCell Deactivation Due to Overheating in High-Band

Figure 9   Secondary Node Release because of Overheating in High-Band

NR-DC Release Case

If the UE requests the release of the Secondary Node in an UAI report, the Master

Node initiates the release with the XnAP: S-NODE RELEASE REQUEST

message with the Time Critical Action cause.

The Master Node disables the NR-DC configuration to prevent the configuration of the

A4 measurement and NR-DC before the overheating is mitigated.

When the UE reports overheating for High-Band without NR-DC configuration, the report

is ignored.

OverheatingAssistance IE Transfer to the Secondary Node

In NR-DC, deactivation of the SCG SCells depends on the UAI overheating report. The

Master Node sends the XnAP: S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message to

the Secondary node, that contains the High-Band-related

overheatingAssistance IE received from UE, in the

allowedReducedConfigForOverheating-r16 IE.

If the Master Node sends the XnAP: S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message

with the ConfigRestrictInfoSCG IE to the Secondary Node for any

other purpose while the UE is in overheating state for High-Band, the

allowedReducedConfigForOverheating-r16 IE is included with

the information received in the UAI report. If the

allowedReducedConfigForOverheating-r16 IE is not included,

the message is treated as confirmation of mitigated overheating.

Engineering Guidelines for NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation

### 3.2.3 Actions after Overheating Condition Mitigation with NR-DC Configuration

If the overheating condition is mitigated, the UE sends an UAI report with an empty

overheatingAssistance indication included in the NR RRC

UEAssistanceInformation message.

The Master Node can initiate the following actions depending on the mitigation

action:

- MCG SCell Reactivation on Low- and Mid-Band
- SCG SCell reactivation on High-Band
- Secondary Node Addition

MCG SCell Reactivation on Low- and Mid-Band

If the overheating condition required the deactivation of MCG SCells and the

overheating mitigation report is received, the Master Node activates all or a part

of the deactivated MCG SCells on Low- and Mid-Band.

Figure 10   SCell Reactivation at Overheating Mitigation in Low- and Mid-Band

SCG SCell Reactivation on High-Band

If the overheating condition required the deactivation of the SCG SCells and the

overheating mitigation report is received, the Master Node sends the

CG-ConfigInfo IE without the

allowedReducedConfigForOverheating-r16 IE in the

XnAP: S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the Secondary Node.

If the conditions for coverage- or buffer-based SCell activation, or both are

fulfilled, all or a part of the deactivated SCG SCells are activated.

Figure 11   SCell Reactivation at Overheating Mitigation in High-Band

Secondary Node Addition for NR-DC

If the overheating condition requires the

release of the Secondary Node and the overheating mitigation

report is received, the Master Node checks if the Secondary Node

Addition conditions are fulfilled. If the conditions are

fulfilled, the Secondary Node Addition procedure is triggered by

configuring the UE with the A4 measurements. If downlink RLC

buffer monitoring, uplink buffer monitoring or both are enabled,

the buffer monitoring starts.

Figure 12   Secondary Node Addition at Overheating Mitigation in High-Band

#### 3.2.3.1 Overheating Mitigation Transfer to the Secondary Node

When NR-DC is configured and overheating is reported for FR2 before receiving the

overheating mitigation report, the Master Node transfers the overheating mitigation

report to the Secondary Node with the XnAP: S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST

message that contains the allowedReducedConfigForOverheating-r16 IE

in the CG-ConfigInfo IE.

### 3.2.4 Mobility with NR-DC Configuration

NR Handover

At each handover, the overheatingAssistanceConfig IE is

reconfigured so that the UE can send the UAI report. The current overheating status

is cleared.

Secondary Node Change

When the Master Node receives the XnAP:S-NODE CHANGE REQUIRED message

from the source Secondary Node, the change of the Secondary Node is initiated. The

target Secondary Node is unaware of any previous overheating condition status, as

the Master Node sends the XnAP: S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message

without the last allowedReducedConfigForOverheating-r16 IE. The

UE is reconfigured with the overheatingAssistanceConfig IE

setup contained in the RRC Reconfiguration message. If the UE still

experiences overheating for High-Band, the UE sends the UAI report again.

## 3.3 Feature Operation with NR Standalone Configuration

With the help of the standardized UAI procedure, UE preferences are sent to the

network to affect the network configuration of the UE.

In case of an NR Standalone configuration, the UE advises the network to temporarily

deactivate all SCells. Once the overheating is mitigated, the network reactivates the

SCells.

The network controls the frequency of the overheating reports.

Steps of overheating mitigation with NR Standalone configured:

1. The UAI configuration for UE overheating is handled by the gNodeB. The configuration is based on the UE capabilities and the configuration of the UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingAssistanceConfig attribute.
2. When the UE detects internal overheating, it triggers a UAI overheating report for the network, and requests actions to be taken. The decision to mitigate the overheating is made by the network when handling the overheating report received in the NR RRC UEAssistanceInformation message.
3. The UE can indicate whether the UE is overheating or the overheating condition is mitigated. Note: UE is overheating if the reducedMaxBW-FR1 or reducedMaxCCs, or both indications are received.
4. The received overheating report is handled by the gNodeB.

### 3.3.1 UAI Configuration for UE Overheating Mitigation with NR Standalone Configuration

The UAI overheating mitigation configuration is controlled by the gNodeB in an NR

Standalone deployment.

The UAI is configured for UE overheating mitigation if all of the following prerequisites

are met:

- The UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingAssistanceConfig attribute is set to true.
- The UE is capable of the overheatingInd UAI overheating indication.

The gNodeB configures the UE to report OtherConfig-v1540.

The value of the UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingIndProhibitTimer attribute

to be sent is determined by UE group profile.

If all the prerequisites are met, the gNodeB sends the RRCReconfiguration

message to the UE.

The UAI configuration is reconfigured in the following cases:

- At handover for the target cell
- Immediately after the RRC Resume procedure by triggering a RRCReconfiguration message to the UE

UEAssistanceInformation-v1540-IEs indication.

The UE sends a new UAI message to the network if the following conditions are

fulfilled:

- Prohibit timer T345, that is the value of the overheatingIndicationProhibitTimer IE, is not running at UE
- Change in the last indicated preferences

Handling the Received UAI Overheating

When NR Standalone is configured and the UAI report includes the

reducedMaxBW-FR1 indication that indicates overheating, all

SCells are deactivated. If the reducedMaxBW-FR1 indication is

set to 0, this parameter is ignored. After sending the UAI report,

the UE starts timer T345 with the value set for the

UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingIndProhibitTimer attribute.

### 3.3.3 Actions after Overheating Condition Mitigation with NR Standalone Configuration

If the overheating condition is mitigated, the UE sends an UAI report with an empty

overheatingAssistance indication included in the NR RRC

UEAssistanceInformation message.

The gNodeB reactivates the deactivated SCells.

# 7 Activate NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation. The overheating

mitigation function can be enabled using attributes.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled

features are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no entries in the LKF

that is installed on the node.

In the case of the NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation feature, the overheating

mitigation function is enabled using attributes and the feature requires the

activation of prerequisite features depending on the deployment.

Prerequisites

- In case of EN-DC deployments, the Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature must be activated on the Master Node.

Steps

1. Depending on the deployment, set the value of the following attributes to true:
    - For EN-DC deployments, set the value of the ENodeBFunction.endcOverheatingAssistance attribute.
    - For NR SA and NR-DC deployments, set the value of the UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingAssistanceConfig attribute.

Related Information

Basic Intelligent Connectivity

# 8 Deactivate NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation

Non-license controlled features cannot be deactivated. When not needed, the

overheating mitigation function can be disabled using attributes.

Prerequisites

- In case of EN-DC deployments, the Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature is activated on the Master Node.

Steps

1. Depending on the deployment, set the value of the following attributes to false:
    - For EN-DC deployments, set the value of the ENodeBFunction.endcOverheatingAssistance attribute.
    - For NR SA and NR-DC deployments, set the value of the UaiProfileUeCfg.overheatingAssistanceConfig attribute.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR UE-Assisted Overheating Mitigation

Different mitigation actions are possible depending on the value of the received

indications.

The following tables show examples of the actions taken depending on the received

overheating indication report:

- Table 7
- Table 8
- Table 9
- Table 10

In the examples, overheating is reported with the following carrier aggregation

configuration:

- Number of Master Node SCells = 3 (MCG CCs = 4)
- Number of Secondary Node SCells = 5 (SCG CCs = 6)

If both uplink and downlink are included in the report, the one with fewer component

carriers (CC) is considered.
