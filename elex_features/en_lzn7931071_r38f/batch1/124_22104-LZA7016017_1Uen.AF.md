Summary

CBRS allows extending the licensed spectrum with shared spectrum, and deploying a network

without acquiring licensed spectrum. The NR Support for CBRS feature enables CBRS in

NR SA deployment.

CBRS has the following benefits:

- Increasing capacity by using the CBRS band in addition to licensed spectrum.
- Allowing access to lightly used commercial spectrum instead of unlicensed technologies where security and interference protection is less robust than through 3GPP technologies.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Support for CBRS

CBRS support requires that radios operate on the CBRS band. Limitations of CBRS on

LTE apply to CBRS on NR as well, and CBRS on NR has additional limitations.

Hardware

CBRS is supported on all Baseband products for NR.

CBRS is supported on the following radios:

- Radio 4408
- Dot 4459
- Dot 4469

For the complete list of radio hardware and combinations with Baseband units that can

be used for CBRS bands, see Supported Radio Capabilities.

Limitations

- Only TDD band 48 is supported as CBRS band.
- Only NR SA deployment with 30 kHz Subcarrier Spacing is supported.
- Only NR TDD patterns aligned with LTE TDD configuration 2 are supported.
- Mixed mode is supported only with single Baseband unit.
- Soft lock is not supported.
- Up to two NR cells can be supported for each CBRS radio.
- Up to four cells with LTE and NR mixed mode configuration can be supported for each CBRS radio, with maximum two NR cells.
- Adding or removing cells or equipment requires that the group is removed from the CBRS Domain Coordinator and readded after update.
- Two cell configurations where one cell is PCell and the other is SCell-only are not supported.
- Two PCell or two SCell-only configurations are supported only with aligned NRFreqRelationTemplate MOs.

Network Requirements

CBRS support requires ENM with CBRS Domain Coordinator. It is recommended to use the

latest version of ENM.

ENM version 22.2 or later is required for mixed mode support and

higher than 50-MHz bandwidth options.

For the CBRS Domain Coordinator, Domain Proxy PKI security certificate is required

for communication with SAS.

Network reliability depends on the reliability of the connection to the SAS and the

DNS.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Support for CBRS

The feature extends the existing CBRS solution to support NR SA deployment.

CBRS cells operate in the CBRS band and are supervised externally to the EPS by the SAS

through the CBRS Domain Coordinator. For a CBRS Device (CBSD) to be able to start

transmission in the CBRS band, it must be registered with SAS and obtain an

authorization grant to use the spectrum.

The CBRS band supports operation in authorized shared access with license for a spectrum

or without license. The spectrum is accessible only at authorization of the SAS. For the

access, a three-tiered spectrum-sharing architecture is used with the following

tiers:

| Incumbent Access                |    | The highest priority tier, reserved for federal incumbent users like                         military, fixed satellite service, or Wireless Internet Service Provider.   Interference protection from all lower tier users.                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Priority Access License (PAL)   |    | Second priority tier, allocated on a county basis.  Each PAL license covers a 10 MHz unit of spectrum in a county. Up to seven                         spectrum units are awarded to the highest bidders. One user can get maximum                         40 MHz of PAL spectrum.   PAL users are protected from interference of other PAL and lower tier users. |
|                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| General Authorized Access (GAA) |    | Lowest priority tier, open for all users, without license.  No interference protection from other users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Each tier accepts interference from tiers above and is protected from tiers below. When

detecting the interference from higher priority tier users, SAS instructs the CBSD to

cease transmission or move to another unoccupied frequency range. However, the SAS can

allocate unused PAL spectrum to GAA users on a dynamic basis.

For a more detailed description of CBRS, see Citizens Broadband Radio Service

Guidelines.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Support for CBRS

The feature has the same network impact as CBRS on LTE, with increased capacity,

reduced cell availability, and increased network load.

Capacity and Performance

CBRS support increases capacity by allowing the operator to use the shared

spectrum.

The feature can decrease cell availability. This is because the NR cells and sector

carriers operating in CBRS band stay disabled until receiving an authorization from

SAS, and become disabled again if the authorization is suspended or expires.

Network load between the node and the CBRS Domain Coordinator is increased because

the time stamp and measurement collection are regularly updated.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Support for CBRS

The feature introduces MO attributes to support NR for CBRS and uses existing

attributes to measure received power.

# 6 Performance of NR Support for CBRS

The feature introduces new counters for downtime measurements and to calculate

bandwidth assignment efficiency.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

The following counters are introduced:

- NRCellDU.pmCellDowntimeManCbrs
- NRSectorCarrier.pmBwAssignedDistr
- NRSectorCarrier.pmSectorCarrierDowntime
- NRSectorCarrier.pmSectorCarrierDowntimeAuto
- NRSectorCarrier.pmSectorCarrierDowntimeAutoCbrs
- NRSectorCarrier.pmSectorCarrierDowntimeMan
- NRSectorCarrier.pmSectorCarrierDowntimeManCbrs

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q2: Higher Bandwidth Options and Mixed Mode Support for CBRS

This feature enhancement adds LTE-NR mixed mode support for CBRS, and allows more

bandwidth options for CBRS on NR.

| Feature Name           | NR Support for CBRS   |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5438          |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002          |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type            | NR                    |

Summary and Benefits

Bandwidth options above 50 MHz become available for downlink-only SCells in NR CBRS.

Enabling downlink-only carriers in higher bandwidths reduces cross-link

interferences in uplink channels.

The feature enhancement also adds mixed mode support for LTE and NR in CBRS.

Capacity and Performance

Capacity is increased by using shared spectrum and higher bandwidths.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
