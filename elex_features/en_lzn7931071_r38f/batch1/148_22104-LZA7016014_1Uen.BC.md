Summary

The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection feature provides functionality to monitor IP

connectivity to next-hop routers

both

static and

policy-based.

The BFD protocol is defined in

IETF

specification RFC 5880,

RFC

5881 and

RFC

5882. BFD provides fast detection when connectivity is lost, so that

traffic can be rerouted using alternative paths.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To

fully benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following network

elements:

- The node must be connected to one or more IPv4 or IPv6 networks.
- Next-hop routers must support BFD, and BFD must be configured on these nodes.

# 3 Feature Operation of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

The feature

enables fast failover from the preferred route to an alternative route by setting up BFD

sessions to the next-hop

router.

The

Static Routing and the

Policy Based Routing features support resilience by

allowing traffic to use alternative routes. BFD enables fast failover from the preferred route

to an alternative route by monitoring the next-hop router. This is done by setting up a BFD

session to the next-hop router.

BFD Sessions

Single-hop BFD sessions are used to monitor connectivity to next-hop routers. BFD sessions

monitor end-to-end connectivity of the entire L3 segment to the next-hop router. This

includes all the underlying L2 segments.

The node operates BFD sessions in asynchronous mode as defined in

IETF

RFC-5880 and

IETF

RFC-5881.

Sessions use the source address associated with the local IP interface, and the destination

address of the next-hop router.

BFD control packets are transmitted in UDP packets with destination port 3784, within an

IPv4 or IPv6 packet. The source port is set to be in the range 64500 through 65300.

One BFD session is created to a given next hop to be monitored. If multiple static or

policy-based routes use this next hop, the node uses the session state to calculate the

availability of each of these routes. Exceptions are the routes that are explicitly

configured not to use BFD monitoring of the next hop.

BFD monitoring for static routes can be applied either for all next hops reached over a

particular interface or it can be applied individually

for

each

next hop.

BFD monitoring for policy based routing can only be applied on

the

interface level and

it

does

not consider settings done

for

each

next hop.

If multiple routes use the same next hop, it is possible to individually exclude specific

routes from using BFD monitoring.

The creation of a new BFD session fails if the system resources are already exhausted by a

large number of simultaneous BFD sessions. Because of this, a BFD session might not be

available to monitor a given next hop. In this case, the route availability is calculated as

if next hop monitoring was disabled for the route.

# 6 Performance of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

There are counters associated with this feature.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

- TWAMP Responders: 60
- BFD Sessions IPv4: 120
- BFD Sessions IPv6: 120
- BFD Profiles: 120

The feature also removes the license for the Virtual Routers feature.

The benefits of the enhancement are the following:

- The extended router configuration supports implementation of network designs based on traffic separation principle.
- The increase of system limits makes configuration more flexible.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement is supported on the Baseband units in RAN Compute group 4 and

higher.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
