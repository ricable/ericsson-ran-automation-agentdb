Summary and Benefits

The Advanced Downlink Multi-User MIMO Mid-Band feature provides advanced beamforming

capability to the gNodeB. Advanced beamforming is reciprocity-based and it uses the

SRS transmitted by the UEs.

The beams formed with this feature are UE-specific and the feature can mitigate the

interference between the users better than the codebook-based Downlink Multi-User

MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature.

Since the interference between the UEs is reduced, the gNodeB can transmit to

several UEs at the same time, using the same physical resources. Each UE can receive

transmission over more than one MIMO layer.

The feature can provide the following benefits if the radio conditions, the amount of

data and the location of the UEs are favorable:

- Improved downlink multi-user MIMO service performance
- Increased spectral efficiency
- Increased potential downlink cell throughput

Summary

The feature increases uplink cell throughput, as multiple devices can be coscheduled

on the same PUSCH time and frequency resources. The increase is proportional to the

number of coscheduled users. Uplink spectrum efficiency and average cell throughput

are also increased by coscheduling multiple users on the same resources.

The feature offers the following functionalities and benefits:

- User-specific beamforming
- CP-OFDM and DFTS-OFDM waveform support
- Suppressed inter- and intra-cell interference
- Increased average and peak uplink cell throughput
- Increased uplink spectrum efficiency

The

Uplink Multi-User MIMO

Low/Mid-Band

feature enables scheduling over multiple layers in the following

ways:

- In the same set of PRBs
- In the entire frequency band
- In parts of the frequency band, and over less number of layers in other parts of the frequency band
