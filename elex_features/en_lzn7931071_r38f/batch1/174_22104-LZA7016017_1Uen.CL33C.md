Summary and Benefits

This feature reduces power consumption in a cell by monitoring traffic conditions, putting a

cell to sleep and waking up a cell based on traffic conditions or configured time.

The NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature allows a radio unit to enter deep sleep when

all cells on the radio unit are in sleep mode. This improves the energy efficiency

of the network.

The feature is not supported on Radio Gateway units or LC-05 9xCPRI link card

configurations.

The feature is only supported on Ericsson gNodeB.

Limitations

- For tasks requiring the handling of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO class, the cell is only set to ENABLED two minutes after the SectorEquipmentFunction MO class is unlocked. If the SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute is reconfigured to refer to a new radio, the FieldReplaceableUnit.deactivateDeepSleep attribute must be manually configured on the previous sleeping radio unit.
- This feature must be deactivated through the enabler attribute for each cell with a radio unit that does not support sleep mode.
- The multi-Layer traffic-aware mode requires at least one radio unit that provides NR coverage carriers and at least one AAS TDD radio unit that provides NR booster carrier.
- If time-based mode with sleep synchronization, or time-based mode without sleep synchronization modes are selected, cells in sleep mode might cause a coverage hole if all the cells that cover an area are put to sleep.
- If an NR capacity module is sleeping while the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature is enabled, and the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature triggers the wake-up of a cell, then all cells related to the same sleeping capacity module are woken up. In this case, the NRCellCU.pmCellBoosterCarrWakeUp PM counter is only pegged for the cell that triggered the wake-up. For the remaining cells in the same sleeping capacity module, the NRCellCU.pmCellBoosterCarrWakeUp PM counter is not pegged when those cells wake up. An exception is when the Booster Carrier Sleep feature might attempt to trigger the wakeup for those cells based on traffic load. This results in the NRCellCU.pmCellBoosterCarrWakeUp Pm counter pegging additionally. For deployments where this behavior is not desirable, the RAN Compute Deep Sleep Mode feature must be disabled.
- If the cell remains in a recovery state for more than 1 second before reactivation during cell wake-up in a CPRI-based Remote radio unit, the NRCellDU.pmCellDowntimeAuto PM counter might be pegged.
- In case of a degraded cell, only light sleep is supported.
- In case of mixed-mode configurations, the LTE cell only supports light sleep.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Booster Carrier Sleep

This feature supports three operational modes.

This feature supports the following operational modes:

- Multi-layer traffic-aware mode, which is enabled by setting the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to true and the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute to MULTI\_LAYER\_TRAFFIC.
- Time-based mode with sleep synchronization, which is enabled by setting the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to true and the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute to TIME.Note: Sleep Synchronization The decision to enter sleep preparation mode is synchronized for cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit. As a result, the cells enter the sleep preparation mode at the same time.
- Time-based mode without sleep synchronization, which is enabled by setting the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to false and the DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute to true. This mode is automatically selected for eCPRI-capable AAS radio units.Note: This mode is planned to be deprecated. For more information about life cycle states, see Managed Object Model Description.
- Independent time-based mode, in which cells in radio units that do not require synchronized sleep enter sleep. It is enabled by setting the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to false and the DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute to true. This mode is automatically selected for CPRI-capable radio units.

Only one operational mode can be configured for each booster cell.

For multi-layer traffic-aware mode, the following basic functions are supported:

- Traffic-aware wake-up of a booster cell based on traffic load and service state from energy performance-related cells
- Traffic-aware sleep of a booster cell based on traffic load and service state from the booster cell and energy performance-related cells

For time-based mode with sleep synchronization and independent time-based mode, the

following basic functions are supported:

- Traffic-aware sleep of a booster cell based on traffic load of the booster cell
- Wake-up of a booster cell based on the configured timer parameter

For both multi-layer traffic-aware mode and time-based mode sleep synchronization, the

following basic functions are supported:

- Configuration for allowing or prohibiting radio deep sleep
- Configuration of multiple time windows when radio deep sleep is allowed, with different parameters for each time window in a day
- Synchronization of sleep decision for cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit

## 3.1 Sleep and Wake-up Cycle

During the operation of multi-layer traffic-aware mode and time-based mode with sleep

synchronization, the values of corresponding attributes are changed when the radio unit

enters or exits sleep mode.

Figure 1   Sleep and Wake-up Cycle

1. The feature is disabled by default. To use multi-layer traffic-aware mode, configure the energy performance-related cells, then set the value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute to MULTI\_LAYER\_TRAFFIC. An energy performance-related cell is a cell that can take the traffic from a corresponding booster cell when the booster cell is in sleep mode. Wake-up of the booster cell is based on the traffic load and service state of energy performance-related cells. To configure an internal or external cell as an energy performance-related cell, set the value of the NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute to true. To use the time-based mode with sleep synchronization, set the value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute to TIME. Energy performance-related cells are not considered for this mode.

2. For multi-layer traffic-aware mode, the sleep requirement evaluation is performed based on the traffic load of the booster cell and the traffic load of the configured energy performance-related cells. For time-based mode, the sleep requirement evaluation is performed based only on the traffic load of the booster cell.
3. If the sleep requirements are fulfilled for a cell, the cell enters the sleep preparation state. At the start of the sleep preparation state, the following procedures are started: Barring the cell through a Master Information Block (MIB) update Traffic blocking is enabled. Note: While enabled, Traffic Blocking is preventing UEs from connecting to the cell that is going to sleep state. The cell rejects new connections, such as Xn, NG, and inter-RAT handovers, as well as EN-DC related attempts like secondary node addition, SCG addition, and PSCell change procedures. A neighboring cell within the same gNB does not initiate new connections, such as intra-gNB handovers and intra-gNB PSCell change procedures for EN-DC, to the concerned cell. Gracefully offloading standalone UEs within the maximum duration defined by the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute The sleep preparation state ends when the offloading procedure is completed. The duration of sleep preparation is equal to the duration of the offloading period. The offloading period is equal to or shorter than the timer duration defined by the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute. The cell remains barred and traffic blocking is enabled while the cell is in sleep mode. During the wake-up preparation, the MIB updates and traffic blocking is disabled. These procedures are common for the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature and the NR Cell Soft Lock feature. For cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit, the decision to enter sleep preparation mode and the decision to enter sleep mode are synchronized. This happens to avoid one cell staying in sleep preparation for a very long time to wait for other cells of the same AAS TDD radio unit to enter sleep preparation mode. Figure 2 Example of Entering Sleep Mode Simultaneously for Cell A and Cell B Figure 2 shows an example where Cell A and Cell B enter sleep preparation simultaneously. The value of the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute is set to 90 for both cells. An extended sleep preparation period is introduced when a cell completes sleep preparation but waits for other cells in the same AAS TDD radio to complete sleep preparation. The total duration of sleep preparation, including any extended sleep preparation, is equal to or shorter than the maximum value of the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute among all cells in the same AAS TDD radio. As a result of this process, Cell A and Cell B enter sleep mode simultaneously. During the sleep preparation and extended sleep preparation period, incoming traffic, including handovers and EN-DC operations in the cell, is rejected. This can cause UEs to stay in the source cell and result high interference in the cell during the sleep preparation or the extended preparation period, which might cause UEs to be abnormally released. It is recommended to enable the Prohibited Cell-Triggered Mobility function to allow inter-frequency handovers to inter-frequency cells to avoid abnormal UE releases because of interference.

4. Sleep preparation or extended sleep preparation is stopped before the cell enters sleep state in the following cases: The value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute is changed to DISABLED. If the value of the EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupPeriodicEsDuration attribute is other than 0, and the periodic wake-up timer expires, when the value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute is set to TIME. The time window that allows cell sleep ends. It is recommended to set the same value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute for all cells in the same AAS TDD radio. It is also recommended to set the same value for the EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupPeriodicEsDuration attribute for all cells in the same AAS TDD radio. This recommended configuration prevents one cell from staying in normal operation state while the other cells in the same AAS TDD radio stay in extended sleep preparation state for a long time. In this case, a cell might stay in an extended preparation state for up to 30 minutes after the cell starts sleep preparation. With the recommended configurations, the waiting time for a cell to remain in an extended preparation state after initiating sleep preparation is specified in one of the following ways: If the booster cells are in the same gNodeB, the longest waiting time is configured through the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute. The default value of this attribute is 90 seconds. If the booster cells are in different gNodeB, the longest waiting time is 30 minutes.
5. If sleep preparation is successful, the cell enters sleep mode.

6. Wake-up requirement is evaluated.
7. If the wake-up requirement is fulfilled for a cell, the cell enters a wake-up preparation state. During this state, the following two procedures are performed: The Master Information Block (MIB) is updated to recover the NRCellDU.cellBarredStatus attribute and the NRCellDU.cellBarredReason attribute to previous state. The traffic blocking is disabled. Table 5 Attribute Values during Normal Operation MO Attribute Value during Normal Operation NRCellDU.cellBarredStatus Option 1 NOT\_BARRED Option 2 BARRED NRCellDU.cellBarredReason Option 1 empty Option 2 MANUAL
8. When wake-up is successful for a cell, the cell returns to the normal operation state.

Sleep and Wake-up Requirement Evaluation for Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

Sleep and Wake-up Requirement Evaluation for Time-Based Mode with Sleep Synchronization

## 3.2 Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

The feature enables multi-layer traffic-aware wake-up and sleep for NR cells. This

mode observes the used capacity factor from booster cells and energy-performance related

cells.

This mode is available only when GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled is

set to true.

For multi-layer traffic-aware mode, the following basic functions are supported:

- Traffic-aware wake-up of a booster cell based on traffic load and service state from energy performance-related cells.
- Traffic-aware sleep of a booster cell based on traffic load and service state from the booster cell and energy performance-related cells.
- Multiple sleep-allowed windows with different parameters are allowed to be configured within the same day.
- Cells in the same AAS TDD radio are synchronized when making sleep decisions.
- Configuration of allowing or prohibiting radio deep sleep.

### 3.2.1 Used Capacity Factor for Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

This feature observes the used capacity factor from booster cells and

energy-performance related cells.

Downlink available capacity factor is introduced by the NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature for traffic

steering.

Downlink available capacity factor associated with a PCell or SCell is derived by the

formula: 100/(1+filtered number of active UEs in downlink), Range:

[0.00 - 100.00], Unit: Percentage.

Downlink used capacity factor is introduced by this feature as a traffic-load metric for

sleep and wake-up evaluations. The metric is derived from available capacity factor by

the formula: used capacity factor = 100.00 - available capacity factor,

Range: [0.00 - 100.00], Unit: Percentage.

Examples:

| UCF = 0.00%   |    | The cell has no load.     |
|---------------|----|---------------------------|
|               |    |                           |
| UCF = 100.00% |    | The cell is fully loaded. |

It is possible to derive the used capacity factor from the

NRCellCU.pmRruCompAvailCapacityDlDistr2 PM counter introduced for

the available capacity factor in the NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature.

### 3.2.2 Traffic-Load Subscription

Traffic-load from energy performance-related cells is collected for sleep and wake-up

decisions.

The feature collects traffic-load from energy performance-related cells for sleep and

wake-up decisions if the value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode is set to

MULTI\_LAYER\_TRAFFIC.

For an internal cell, if the value of the

NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute is configured to

be true, the cell is the energy performance-related cell. The traffic

load is collected and used for sleep and wake-up evaluations. This is applicable only

when the value of the GNBCUCPFunction.resourceStatusReportF1Enabled

attribute is set to true.

For an external cell, if the value of the

NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute is configured to

be true, the cell is the energy performance-related cell. The traffic

load is collected over Xn and used for sleep and wake-up evaluations. This is applicable

only when the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.resourceStatusReportF1Enabled attribute is set to

true in the external gNodeB.

The Xn subscription of the traffic load is common for this feature and the NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature.

Subscription Selection

All external cells configured as energy performance-related cells for one or more

booster cells in a gNodeB are selected in the Xn subscription list.

1. The gNodeB send the XnAP RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message to the neighbor gNodeB to initiate a subscription.
2. The neighbor gNodeB sends back the XnAP RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
3. When the subscribing gNodeB receives an XnAP RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message, it means that the subscription towards the neighbor gNodeB is set up successfully. The subscribing gNodeB starts a timer that is used to supervise when the XnAP RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message is received.
4. The used capacity factor is calculated by the neighbor gNodeBs and sent to the subscribing gNodeB in the XnAP RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message. If this message is received before the timer expires, the timer restarts.
5. The subscribing gNodeB stores the used capacity factor information and uses it during feature operation.

For more information, see NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination.

Reprioritization of Subscriptions

Reprioritization of subscriptions is done periodically every 24 hours.

Cells that are no longer configured as energy performance-related cells and not used

by the NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature are removed from

subscriptions.

### 3.2.3 Sleep and Wake-up Requirement Evaluation for Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

The mode determines whether to put booster cells to sleep based on the sleep

requirement evaluation. It also decides whether to wake up the booster cells based on the

wake-up requirement evaluation.

Sleep Requirement Evaluation

Figure 4   Sleep Requirement Evaluation Process

The sleep requirement is fulfilled if the following conditions are both fulfilled:

- Sleep Condition 1 is true for at least P1% of the time within T
- Sleep Condition 2 is true for at least P2% of the time within T

Out-of-service energy performance-related cells are ignored.

Wake-up Requirement Evaluation

Figure 5   Wake-up Requirement Evaluation Process

Wake-up requirement is fulfilled if either of the following is fulfilled:

- Wake-up condition 1 is true for at least P% of the time within T1
- Wake-up condition 2 is true for a successive time duration, T2

The wake-up requirement can also be fulfilled in the following cases:

- A cell re-setup is triggered by BFN adjustment, a software error, or other circumstances.
- If the booster cell is in sleep state and has only one configured energy performance-related cell, and one of the following conditions is fulfilled: The cell relation of the energy performance-related cell is removed. The value of the NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute for the energy-performance related cell is changed from true to false.
- The configured sleep-allowed window defined by the TimeSchedulingWindow.stopTime timer expires.
- The feature is deactivated.
- The node is restarted.
- The NRCellCU MO instance is locked.
- The NRSectorCarrier MO instance is locked.

If one cell wakes up, all cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit wake up.

## 3.3 Time-Based Mode with Sleep Synchronization

This mode enables traffic-aware sleep and time-based wake-up for NR cells. This mode

observes the used capacity factor from booster cells.

This mode is available only when GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled is

set to true.

For time-based mode with sleep synchronization, the following functions are supported:

- Traffic-aware sleep of a booster cell based on traffic load from the booster cell.
- Wake-up of a booster cell based on the configured timer parameter.
- Multiple sleep-allowed windows with different parameters are allowed to be configured within the same day.
- Sleep decisions are synchronized for cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit.
- Configuration of allowing or prohibiting radio deep sleep.

### 3.3.1 Used Capacity Factor for Time-Based Mode with Sleep Synchronization

This feature observes the used capacity factor from booster cells.

Downlink available capacity factor is introduced by the NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature for traffic

steering.

Downlink available capacity factor associated with a PCell or SCell is derived by the

formula: 100/(1+filtered number of active UEs in downlink), Range:

[0.00 - 100.00], Unit: Percentage.

Downlink used capacity factor is introduced by this feature as a traffic-load metric for

sleep and wake-up evaluations. The metric is derived from available capacity factor by

the formula: used capacity factor = 100.00 - available capacity factor,

Range: [0.00 - 100.00], Unit: Percentage.

Examples:

| UCF = 0.00%   |    | The cell has no load.     |
|---------------|----|---------------------------|
|               |    |                           |
| UCF = 100.00% |    | The cell is fully loaded. |

It is possible to derive the used capacity factor from the

NRCellCU.pmRruCompAvailCapacityDlDistr2 PM counter introduced for

the available capacity factor in the NR Advanced Multi-Layer Coordination feature.

### 3.3.2 Sleep and Wake-up Requirement Evaluation for Time-Based Mode with Sleep Synchronization

The mode determines whether to put booster cells to sleep based on the sleep

requirement evaluation. It also decides whether to wake up the booster cells based on the

wake-up requirement evaluation.

Sleep Requirement Evaluation

Figure 6   Process of Sleep Requirement Evaluation

Sleep requirement is fulfilled if the sleep condition is fulfilled for at least P% of

the time within T.

Energy performance-related cells are not considered for Time-based mode.

Wake-up Requirement Evaluation

When the configured timer defined by the

EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupPeriodicEsDuration attribute expires,

the cell wakes up. If one

cell

wakes up, all cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit wake up.

Wake-up can also be triggered in the following cases:

- A cell re-setup is triggered by BFN adjustment, a software error, or other circumstances.
- The configured sleep-allowed window defined by the TimeSchedulingWindow.stopTime timer expires.
- The feature is deactivated.
- The node is restarted.
- The NRCellCU MO instance is locked.
- The NRSectorCarrier MO instance is locked.

## 3.4 Time-Based Mode without Sleep Synchronization

This mode monitors downlink total PRB for sleep decisions while wake-up decisions are

based on configured time.

Time-based mode without sleep synchronization is planned to be deprecated.

This mode is available only when both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The value of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is set to false
- The value of the DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute is set to true

This feature monitors traffic conditions and puts cells with a low total downlink PRB use

to sleep. Only fault-free sector carriers are put to sleep. The feature also allows a

radio unit to enter into deep sleep mode if all cells are in sleep mode

and the configured time window enables it. This further reduces the power

consumption.

The cells and the radio unit wake up

when

one the following conditions apply:

- The periodic wake-up timer expires.
- The daily sleep window expires.
- The feature is deactivated.
- The NRCellCU MO instance is locked.
- The NRSectorCarrier MO instance is locked.
- A cell re-setup is triggered by Basic Frame Number (BFN) adjustment, a software error, or other circumstances.
- The node is restarted.

If the cells wake up because of a cell status update or node restart, the energy saving

processes enabled by the feature are initiated again, once other conditions allow

it.

Operational Process

Figure 7   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The feature starts monitoring the filtered downlink total PRB use of the configured cell the minute after the end of the period configured in the DESManagementFunction.esNotAllowedTimePeriod attribute, with a possible delay of about one minute or less.
2. If the filtered downlink total PRB use is continuously below the threshold during the monitoring period, the cell prepares to sleep, and the feature starts offloading UEs from the cell with low downlink total PRB use to the neighboring cells. The value of the NRCellDU.cellBarredStatus attribute changes to BARRED and the value of the NRCellDU.cellBarredReason attribute changes to BOOSTER\_CARRIER\_SLEEP. For more information, see NR Cell Soft Lock.Note: The threshold for downlink total PRB use and the monitoring period are configured using the following struct members of the DESManagementFunction.intraRatEsActivationOriginalCellLoadParameters attribute: threshold timeDuration
3. If all the other cells on the radio unit are preparing to sleep or are barred by the feature for energy saving, the feature puts the cell with low downlink total PRB use to sleep mode for the time period configured in the DESManagementFunction.periodicEsDuration attribute. The value of the DESManagementFunction.energySavingState attribute changes to IS\_ENERGYSAVING in the NRCellCU MO instance that represents the cell.
4. The NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature puts a radio unit to deep sleep if the following conditions apply: The radio unit supports the Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature. All cells in the radio unit are in sleep mode. The DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime attribute is configured according to recommendations.
5. If a radio unit is in deep sleep, the feature restarts the radio unit when the period configured in the DESManagementFunction.periodicEsDuration attribute ends. The radio unit wakes up from deep sleep.
6. When the period configured in the DESManagementFunction.periodicEsDuration attribute ends, the feature wakes up the cell from sleep mode. The value of the DESManagementFunction.energySavingState attribute changes to IS\_NOT\_ENERGYSAVING in the NRCellCU MO instance that represents the cell.Note: The time required for cell wake-up is defined by the value of the DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime attribute. When the feature wakes up the cell from sleep mode, the NRCellDU.pmDuCellDownUnlockMan counter is stepped.
7. The operational process repeats until the minute before the beginning of the period configured in the DESManagementFunction.esNotAllowedTimePeriod attribute.

When a cell starts the preparation for sleep mode, incoming

handovers and EN-DC attempts from an external gNodeB are rejected. This happens

regardless of the value of the

UeMCCellProfile.connModeUeAllowedToBarredCell attribute when

the value of the NRCellDU.CellBarredReason attribute is

BOOSTER\_CARRIER\_SLEEP.

## 3.5 Independent Time-Based Mode

This mode monitors downlink total PRB for sleep decisions while wake-up decisions are

based on configured time.

This mode is automatically selected for CPRI-based radio units.

This mode is available only when both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The value of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is set to false
- The value of the DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute is set to true

This feature monitors traffic conditions and puts cells to sleep. Only fault-free sector

carriers are put to sleep. The feature also allows a radio unit to enter into deep sleep

mode if all cells are in sleep mode and the configured time window enables

it..

This further reduces the power consumption.

The cells and the radio unit wake up

when

one the following conditions apply:

- The periodic wake-up timer expires.
- The daily sleep window expires.
- The feature is deactivated.
- The NRCellCU MO instance is locked.
- The NRSectorCarrier MO instance is locked.
- A cell re-setup is triggered by Basic Frame Number (BFN) adjustment, a software error, or other circumstances.
- The node is restarted.

If the cells wake up because of a cell status update or node restart, the energy saving

processes enabled by the feature are initiated again, once other conditions allow

it.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Booster Carrier Sleep

The feature affects traffic and capacity.

Capacity and Performance

The feature puts cells to sleep, and moves UEs to the neighboring cells, which has

the following effects:

- Cells in sleep mode have no capacity.
- Neighboring cells have increased traffic.

Some delay is expected before waking cells are able to serve any traffic.

Cells in sleep mode do not provide connectivity for UEs, therefore, the following

functions are impacted:

- Carrier aggregation
- Inter-frequency mobility
- Intra-frequency mobility

The following retainability KPIs for the UEs in the cell being put to sleep might be

impacted negatively compared to normal operations:

- Retainability KPIs for NR standalone if NR standalone UEs are remaining after sleep preparation
- Retainability KPIs for EN-DC if EN-DC UEs are remaining after sleep preparation

Due to rejecting incoming traffic, the following KPIs in neighboring nodes might be

impacted negatively compared to normal operation:

- Mobility KPIs in neighboring nodes. Handover preparation failure might increase during the sleep preparation process.
- Integrity and retainability KPIs in neighboring nodes. During the sleep preparation process, the cell still provides normal services only that it is not accepting new traffic. Therefore, if not handed over to another frequency, UEs on the intra-frequency neighboring cell borders might experience high-level interference.
- Accessibility and mobility KPIs for EN-DC in neighboring node because EN-DC setup and SgNB modification failure might increase during the sleep preparation process.
- Integrity and retainability KPIs for EN-DC in neighboring nodes. During the sleep preparation process, the cell still provides normal services but it is not accepting new traffic. Therefore, if not changed to another frequency, UEs on the intra-frequency neighboring cell borders might experience high-level interference.

The number of RRC measurement reports might increase if additional target evaluation

is enabled for measurement reports for traffic offload.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Booster Carrier Sleep

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Booster Carrier Sleep

This feature requires or recommends the following configurations for optimal

functioning.

This feature supports the following operational modes with separate configuration

recommendations:

- Multi-layer traffic-aware mode
- Time-based mode with sleep synchronization
- Time-based mode without sleep synchronization

The following terminology applies to this feature:

| booster cell                    |    | A booster cell is a cell which is expected to enter sleep state to save                             energy. To activate the feature for the booster cell, set the value of                             the enabler attribute to MULTI_LAYER_TRAFFIC or                                 TIME.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## 8.1 Configuration for Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

This operational mode has required and recommended configurations for optimal

functioning.

Enabling and Disabling Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

To enable this mode, the following sequence is recommended to follow:

1. The software upgrade and a node restart are performed.Note: The DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute must not be enabled for any cell after the restart.
2. The value of the node-level GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is changed to true.
3. Energy performance-related cells are configured.Note: This step must be done after changing the value of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to true. Otherwise, booster cells might not enter sleep state as expected.
4. The TimeSchedulingWindow, the EpBoosterCellProfile, and the EpBoosterAdvCfg MO instances are configured. This step can be done before the configuration of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute.
5. The value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute is changed to MULTI\_LAYER\_TRAFFIC for booster cells.Note: For subsequent configurations, only this step is required.

To disable the multi-layer traffic-aware mode for an NR cell, the value of the

NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute must be changed to

DISABLED or TIME.

To disable the multi-layer traffic-aware mode in a gNodeB and change to time-based

mode without sleep synchronization, the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute must be changed

to false.

Configuring Energy Performance-Related Cell for a Specific Booster Cell

Figure 9   Example of Coverage Cell Configuration

The cells on Figure 9 fulfill the

following roles:

- For Cell n1, Cell n3 and Cell n4 are the energy performance-related cells, while Cell n4 is also the coverage cell.
- For Cell n2, Cell n3 and Cell n4 are the energy performance-related cells, while Cell n4 is also the coverage cell.
- For Cell n3, Cell n4 is the energy performance-related cell and the coverage cell.

The cells on  fulfill the following roles:

A booster cell is a cell which is configured to enter sleep state to save energy. To

activate this feature for the booster cell, set the value of the

NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute to

MULTI\_LAYER\_TRAFFIC.

An energy performance-related cell is the cell that can carry a part of the traffic

or all of the traffic when the corresponding booster cell enters sleep state. To

configure energy performance-related cells, set the value of the

NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute to

true.

A coverage cell is a special energy performance-related cell of a booster cell. To

configure a coverage cell, set the value of the

NRCellCU.epBoCSMode to DISABLED.

To configure an energy performance-related cell for a specific booster cell, the

following conditions must be fulfilled:

1. For a specific booster cell, other booster cells in the same AAS TDD radio unit must be identified. It is not recommended to configure a cell to be the energy performance-related cell for another cell if both cells are in the same AAS TDD radio unit. This can cause unexpected behavior.
2. A list of inter-frequency cells planned to be energy performance-related cell candidates is identified, if one of the following conditions is fulfilled: An inter-frequency cell has coverage overlap with the booster cell and it has larger coverage than the booster cell. An inter-frequency cell has coverage overlap with the booster cell and it has similar coverage as the booster, but it has a larger bandwidth than the booster cell. An inter-frequency cell has coverage overlap with the booster cell and it has similar coverage and bandwidth as the booster cell.Note: When both cells are in sleep state, it is recommended to configure the cell to wake up first to be the energy performance-related cell of the other cell. For a certain inter-frequency layer, if more than one cell fulfills one of the above conditions, it is recommended to select only one cell to be the energy performance-related cell. This selected cell is recommended to have the most coverage overlap with the booster cell. If more than one cell is selected for each frequency, the setting might be relatively more conservative from an energy saving perspective. It is not recommended for two inter-frequency neighbor cells to be configured as energy performance-related cells for each other. This can cause unexpected behavior.
3. The selected energy performance-related cells must be configured by setting the value of the NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute to true for the booster cell.
4. One or more coverage cells must be selected for the booster cell from the selected energy performance-related cells. For the selected coverage cell or cells, the value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute must always be DISABLED. For each booster cell, at least one coverage cell must be configured. It is recommended to select the common coverage cells for multiple booster cells to maximize energy saving.

Configurations of the TimeSchedulingWindow MO Instance

The TimeSchedulingWindow.daysOfWeek attribute can be used to

configure the day or days when the feature is active for the referenced

EpBoosterCellProfile MO instance. The start and stop times of

this period can be configured through the

TimeSchedulingWindow.startTime and the

TimeSchedulingWindow.stopTime attributes. It is possible to

configure multiple configurations of the TimeSchedulingWindow MO

instance in the same day. Each of the configured time windows refers to one of

configuration the EPBoosterCellProfile MO instance.

Table 9   Example of EPBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime

Configurations

| Time Windows in the Same Day   | EPBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime                                         Configurations   |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00:00–07:00                    | 540 seconds                                                                                      |
| 07:01–23:59                    | 15 seconds                                                                                       |

The time window configuration cannot cover more than one day. For example, to set a

time window from 22:00 on Wednesday to 04:00 on Thursday, two separate time windows

must be set. One from 22:00 to 23:59 on Wednesday, and from 00:00 to 04:00 on

Thursday.

When configuring two time windows in the same TimeSchedulingGroup

MO instance, the starting time of the later time window must be set to a later time

than the end time of the previous time window.

Configurations of the EpBoosterAdvCfg and the EpBoosterCellProfile MO

Instances

Allowing or prohibiting radio deep sleep can be configured through the

EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime attribute in the

following ways:

- To allow radio deep sleep, it is recommended to set the value of the EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime attribute to 600.
- To allow carrier sleep mode but prohibit radio deep sleep, it is recommended to set the value of the EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime attribute to 15.

For more information on which radio units support deep sleep, see Radio Deep Sleep Mode.

It is possible to configure the following sleep settings:

- A relatively conservative sleep setting, making it harder to sleep and easier to wake up
- A relatively aggressive sleep setting, making it easier to sleep and harder to wake up

The following attributes are used to configure the sleep settings:

- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepEvaluateTimeWindow
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepFilterTimePercentage
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepRelBoosterFilterTimePerc
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepUcfWakeupThreshFactor
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupEvaluateTimeWindow
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupFilterTimePercentage
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupMissingSampleTime
- EpBoosterCellProfile.sleepUcfThreshBooster
- EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupUcfThresh

The default values in the automatically created

EpBoosterCellProfile and EpBoosterAdvCfg

MO instances can provide a benchmark setting.

The following changes to the benchmark settings result in a relatively aggressive

sleep setting:

- Increasing the value of one of the following attributes while keeping the other attributes in the EpBoosterCellProfile and the EpBoosterAdvCf MO instances the same as the benchmark settings: EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupEvaluateTimeWindow EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupFilterTimePercentage EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupMissingSampleTime EpBoosterCellProfile.sleepUcfThreshBooster EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupUcfThresh
- Reducing the value of one of the following attributes while keeping the other attributes in the EpBoosterCellProfile and the EpBoosterAdvCf MO instances the same as the benchmark settings: EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepEvaluateTimeWindow EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepFilterTimePercentage EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepRelBoosterFilterTimePerc EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepUcfWakeupThreshFactor

The following changes to the benchmark settings result in a relatively conservative

sleep setting:

- Reducing the value of one of the following attributes while keeping the other attributes in the EpBoosterCellProfile and the EpBoosterAdvCf MO instances the same as the benchmark settings: EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupEvaluateTimeWindow EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupFilterTimePercentage EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupMissingSampleTime EpBoosterCellProfile.sleepUcfThreshBooster EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupUcfThresh
- Increasing the value of one of the following attributes while keeping the other attributes in the EpBoosterCellProfile and the EpBoosterAdvCf MO instances the same as the benchmark settings: EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepEvaluateTimeWindow EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepFilterTimePercentage EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepRelBoosterFilterTimePerc EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepUcfWakeupThreshFactor

Examples for Configurations of the EpBoosterAdvCfg and the EpBoosterCellProfile

MO Instances

The following setup examples can be used for different configuration strategies:

- Setup examples for Radio Deep Sleep mode. A more aggressive sleep setting saves more energy but comes with a higher risk of reducing UE throughput.

## 8.2 Configuration for Time-Based Mode with Sleep Synchronization

This operational mode has required and recommended configurations for optimal

functioning.

Enabling and Disabling Multi-Layer Traffic-Aware Mode

To enable the mode, the following sequence is recommended to follow:

1. The software upgrade and a node restart are performed.Note: The DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute must not be enabled for any cell after the restart.
2. The value of the node-level GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is changed to true.
3. The TimeSchedulingWindow, the EpBoosterCellProfile, and the EpBoosterAdvCfg MO instances are configured. This step can be done before the configuration of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute.
4. The value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute is changed to TIME for booster cells.Note: For subsequent configurations, only this step is required.

To disable the time-based mode with sleep synchronization for an NR cell, the value

of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute must be changed to

DISABLED or MULTI\_LAYER\_TRAFFIC.

To disable the time-based mode with sleep synchronization in a gNodeB and change to

the time-based mode without sleep synchronization, the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute must be changed

to false.  A node restart is strongly recommended.

Configurations of the TimeSchedulingWindow MO Instance

The TimeSchedulingWindow.daysOfWeek attribute can be used to

configure the day or days when the feature is active for the referenced

EpBoosterCellProfile MO instance. The start and stop times of

this period can be configured through the

TimeSchedulingWindow.startTime and the

TimeSchedulingWindow.stopTime attributes. It is possible to

configure multiple configurations of the

TimeSchedulingWindow

MO instance in the same day. Each of the configured time-windows refers to

one

of configuration the EPBoosterCellProfile MO

instance.

Table 14   Example

of EPBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime

Configurations

| Time Windows in the Same Day   | EPBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime                                         Configurations   |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00:00–07:00                    | 540 seconds                                                                                      |
| 07:01–23:59                    | 15 seconds                                                                                       |

The time window configuration cannot cover more than one day. For example, to set a

time window from 22:00 on Wednesday to 04:00 on Thursday, two separate time windows

must be set. One from 22:00 to 23:59 on Wednesday, and from 00:00 to 04:00 on

Thursday.

When configuring two time windows in the same TimeSchedulingGroup

MO instance, the

starting

time of the later time window must be set to a later time than the

end

time of the previous time window.

Configurations of the EpBoosterAdvCfg and the EpBoosterCellProfile MO

Instances

Radio deep sleep can be allowed or prohibited by configuring the

EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime attribute in the

following ways:

- To allow radio deep sleep, it is recommended to set the value of the EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime attribute to 600.
- To allow carrier sleep mode but prohibit radio deep sleep, it is recommended to set the value of the EpBoosterCellProfile.wakeupRequiredTime attribute to 15.

For more information on which radio units support deep sleep, see Radio Deep Sleep Mode.

It is possible to configure the following sleep settings:

- A relatively conservative sleep setting, making it harder to sleep and easier to wake up
- A relatively aggressive sleep setting, making it easier to sleep and harder to wake up

The following attributes are used to configure the sleep settings:

- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepEvaluateTimeWindow
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepFilterTimePercentage
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepRelBoosterFilterTimePerc
- EpBoosterAdvCfg.sleepUcfWakeupThreshFactor
- EpBoosterCellProfile.sleepUcfThreshBooster

The

EpBoosterAdvCfg.wakeupPeriodicEsDuration

attribute is used to configure the periodic wake-up, regardless of traffic

conditions, when the value of the NRCellCU.epBoCSMode attribute

is set to TIME.

## 8.3 Configuration for Time-Based Mode without Sleep Synchronization

This mode requires or recommends the following configurations for optimal

functioning.

Enabling and Disabling Time-Based Mode without Sleep Synchronization

To enable the function, set the value of the

DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute to

true for each cell if the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled set to

false.

To disable the function, set the value of the

DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute to

false for each cell.

Allowing and Disallowing Radio Deep Sleep

The DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime attribute determines

whether the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature puts radio units to deep sleep.

To allow deep sleep, it is recommended to set the

DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime attribute to

600.

To prohibit deep sleep, it is recommended to set the

DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime attribute to

15.

For information on which radio units support deep sleep, see Radio Deep Sleep Mode.

Configuring Not Allowed Periods

Not allowed periods are configured using the timePeriod struct of

the DESManagementFunction.esNotAllowedTimePeriod attribute. If

the attribute is not set, the feature is always enabled.

If a day in the timePeriod struct is set to

false, the feature is enabled throughout the day.

If a day in the timePeriod struct is set to true,

the feature is disabled for the period determined by the

startTime and endTime struct members.

The timePeriod struct can be configured using multiple entries.

Multiple entries are required to set different not allowed periods for different

days.

To disable the feature for a period that runs over midnight, the operator must

configure the following not allowed periods separately:

- The first not allowed period must end at 23:59 on the first day.
- The second not allowed period must start at 00:00 on the second day.

The monitoring period must last for at least one minute. As a result, the feature

does not put any cells to sleep in the one-minute gap between the end of the first

not allowed period and the start of the second one.

Monitoring does not begin immediately after the value set in the

endTime struct member of the timePeriod

struct of the DESManagementFunction.esNotAllowedTimePeriod

attribute.

Example 1   Disabling Time-Based Mode without Synchronization for the Daytime

The following configuration allows monitoring only during the following periods:

- On weekdays from 22:01, with a possible delay of up to two seconds, to 05:59
- On weekends from 20:01, with a possible delay of up to two seconds, to 07:59

Both struct entries are required to set different not allowed periods for weekdays

and weekends.

## 8.4 Deprecation Handling

The DESManagementFunction MO instance is introduced for deprecation

handling.

The following attributes are introduced for deprecation handling:

- DESManagementFunction.desSwitch
- DESManagementFunction.energySavingState
- DESManagementFunction.esNotAllowedTimePeriod
- DESManagementFunction.iRatEsActOrigCellLoadParam
- DESManagementFunction.periodicEsDuration
- DESManagementFunction.requiredWakeUpTime
- GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled

The GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled

attribute

controls which of the following

configurations

is used:

- If the value of the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is changed from true to false, the legacy MOM configuration is used. The function associated with the introduced MOM configuration stops working immediately.
- If the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is changed from false to true, the introduced MOM configuration is used. The function associated with legacy MOM configuration stops working immediately.

A node restart is required after changing the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to reset the

software in order to operate the selected function. An exception is when the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is not available

prior to the software upgrade and the attribute is available after the upgrade. In this

case, the legacy configuration must be disabled by setting the value of the

DESManagementFunction.desSwitch attribute to

false before the software upgrade. After the node restart

that

occurs during the software upgrade, the value of the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute must be set to

true, to use the

introduced MOM configuration.

The GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is planned to be

deprecated when the DESManagementFunction MO instance is deprecated.

If the change to the introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the

deprecation window ends, the

default

values are applied. After the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is

deprecated, a node restart is not required to enable or disable the usage of the

introduced MOM configuration.

## 8.5 Migration Information

The GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabledattribute is introduced to

control whether the legacy or the updated MOM configuration is used.

- If the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is set to false, legacy attributes are used with deprecation handling.
- If the GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute is set to true, the introduced MOM configuration is used.

It is recommended to review the default values in the

EpBoosterCellProfile and the EpBoosterAdvCfg

MO instances. The TimeSchedulingGroup and the

TimeSchedulingWindow MO instances must be created.

Energy performance-related cell relations must be configured during this period in the

NRCellRelation.epLoadMonitoringEnabled attribute.

## Appendix A.e: 25.Q1.0: NR Booster Carrier Sleep for CPRI-Based Radio Units

This feature enhancement enables CPRI-based radio units to save energy by detecting

cells with low traffic load and implementing various sleep mechanisms.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  | Mandatory               |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature to be supported

on CPRI-based radio units. The NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature allows overlaid

booster cells to detect low-traffic conditions and enter into cell sleep mode

automatically, saving energy. If all cells in the radio unit are in sleep mode, the

radio unit enters deep sleep mode, which further reduces energy consumption. Cell

sleep is based on a threshold of the total downlink PRB utilization and cell wake-up

is based on a timer that can be set using the

DESManagementFunction.periodicEsDuration attribute.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement causes cells with low traffic to enter cell sleep mode and

radio units to enter deep sleep mode, saving energy. This feature enhancement can

also increase traffic in neighboring cells because the UEs are moved to them.

The capacity of the network decreases for each sleeping cell. Cell wake-up is based

on a timer and it also takes time for a waking cell to be fully operable.

Cell sleep and wake-up can temporarily reduce SINR for several seconds on other

activated carriers in the same radio unit.

The following PM counters can be used to monitor the energy saving enabled by this

feature enhancement:

- FieldReplaceableUnit.pmFruDeepSleepTime
- NRCellDU.pmCellSleepTimeEnergySaving

Operation

For tasks requiring the handling of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO

class, the cell is only set to ENABLED two minutes after the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO class is unlocked.

If the SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute is

reconfigured to refer to a new radio, the

FieldReplaceableUnit.deactivateDeepSleep attribute must be

manually configured on the previous sleeping radio unit.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is fully supported on the following non-AAS-capable radio

units:

- Radio 2251
- Radio 2271
- Radio 4456

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables multi-layer, traffic-aware wake-up and sleep for NR

cells.

Traffic-aware

wake-up of a booster cell is based

on

traffic load

and

service state

from

energy-performance related cells.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Allowing flexible configurations of time windows to provide more energy saving possibilities.
- Allowing traffic-aware sleep or wake-up of a booster cell based on the traffic load and the service state of coverage cells
- Avoiding congestion or overload on coverage cells
- Avoiding user experience degradation caused by energy saving in high traffic load
- Increasing energy efficiency by allowing longer sleep-allowed time window
- Increasing energy efficiency by reducing unnecessary wake-ups might be caused by periodic wake-ups

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement improves throughput by considering the load on energy

performance-related cells during sleep and wake-up decisions. As a result, the

amount of time when cells sleep is minimized if additional capacity is required.

Additionally, cell sleep is prevented when the load on other energy

performance-related cells is high.

Operation

This feature enhancement enables the following operational modes for the NR Booster

Carrier Sleep feature:

- Multi-layer traffic-aware mode
- Time-based mode with sleep synchronization

This feature enhancement introduces an MO configuration to enable traffic-based

wake-up and sleep for NR cells. Operators must replace the current MO structure with

the configuration introduced by this feature enhancement.

This feature enhancement introduces the

GNBCUCPFunction.altDepHBoCSEnabled attribute to allow both

configurations available for the reconfiguration period.
