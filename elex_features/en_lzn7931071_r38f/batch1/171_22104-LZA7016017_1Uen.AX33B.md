# 1 NR OAM and Node Security Overview

This feature is a collection of all OAM and Node Security functionality.

| Feature Name:           | NR OAM and Node Security   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Access Type:            | NR                         |
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5548               |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002               |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node        |

Summary

OAM and Node Security is not a feature. This document describes security functionality.

Security enhancements can be found in the Appendix.

OAM and Node Security is introduced to the NR Base Package to prevent security enhancements

from being handled as system improvements. This includes Security for O&amp;M

Interfaces, User Authentication and Authorization, Signed Software validation and

related functionality.

Additional Information

More information about OAM and Node Security and related topics can be found in the following

documentation:

- Manage Security
- Manage User Access
- Node Hardening Guidelines
- Security User Guide

# 2 Dependencies of NR OAM and Node Security

OAM and Node Security has no dependencies.

Feature Dependencies

The feature has no dependencies. For security related feature dependencies that are

related to OAM and Node Security, see the Manage Security

and Manage User Access

document.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR OAM and Node Security

This feature is a collection of all OAM and Node Security functionality.

Improvements for the following functions are handled as security enhancements under OAM

and Node Security:

- Security for O&amp;M Interfaces
- User Authentication
- User Authorization
- Signed Software validation

Additional Information

More information about OAM and Node Security and related topics can be found in the

following documentation:

- Manage Security
- Manage User Access
- Node Hardening Guidelines
- Security User Guide

# 4 Network Impact of NR OAM and Node Security

The implementation of OAM and Node Security has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

For security related interfaces that are related to OAM and Node Security, see the

Manage Security

and Manage User Access

document.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR OAM and Node Security

Several attributes which were introduced by the Security Management feature are also

applicable to OAM and Node Security.

For security related MOs, see the Security User Guide document.

# 6 Performance of NR OAM and Node Security

OAM and Node Security has no associated KPIs.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 23.Q1: NR and LTE OAM and Node Security for COM User Roles

The feature introduces new COM user roles for NR and LTE, which support more detailed

authorization. As a result, the execution of common tasks no longer requires unnecessarily

high privileges.

| Feature Name           | NR OAM and Node Security   | LTE OAM and Node Security   | Security Management   | GSM System Improvements in 23.Q1   |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|

| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package            | LTE Base Package            | WCDMA Base Package    | GSM Base Package                   |

| Access Type            | NR                         | LTE                         | WCDMA                 | GSM                                |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  | Mandatory                   | Mandatory             | Mandatory                          |

Summary and Benefits

The feature allows the allocation of tailored roles to user accounts for common

tasks, instead of using the high privileged Maintenance User account. The two new

pre-defined COM User Roles allow field technicians to do common tasks without having

full access to the entire MOM. Currently such tasks either require an administrator

role or a Maintenance User account, therefore the introduced roles will serve as a

solution to this issue.

The following characteristics apply to the roles:

- Users with the Diagnostic\_Application\_Troubleshooter role will be capable to execute health-checks, which is otherwise limited to read-only operations.
- Users with the Advanced\_Application\_Troubleshooter role will be capable to lock or unlock cells and perform an NE restart.

Assigning both roles to user profiles creates a combination of the two roles that

will provide sufficient privileges for advanced field technicians to perform a

complete set of operations.

The OAM and Node Security feature is introduced to NR and LTE base packages to

prevent security enhancements from being handled as system improvements.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 23.Q1: SNMPv3 Authentication and Secure NTP with Stronger Ciphers
