# 1 NR Increased Number of GTP-U Connections Overview

Summary and Benefits

The GTP-U connection, also referred to as GTP-U path or GTP-U link, is a unidirectional or

bidirectional IP path identified by the local and the remote IP address pair. A

single GTP-U connection can carry GTP-U messages that are related to multiple GTP-U

tunnels. A GTP-U tunnel within a single GTP-U connection is identified by the TEID

value.

This feature increases the number of maximum supported S1-U and NG-U GTP-U

connections. The maximum number of these connections can be created simultaneously.

The newly created S1-U GTP-U paths can be supervised with the GTP-U Supervision

feature if it is enabled for the core network connections on the gNodeB. This has no

negative impact on the performance of GTP-U Supervision feature.

The feature has the following benefits:

- The cardinality increase of the S1-U links in EN-DC removes limitations that might occur when the gNodeB is connected to Cloud-based EPC networks.
- The cardinality increase of the NG-U links in NR SA removes limitations that might occur when the gNodeB is connected to Cloud-based 5GC networks.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

The feature increases the overall number of GTP-U links in the core network by increasing

the maximum number of S1-U and NG-U GTP-U paths in the gNodeB. This S1-U or NG-U GTP-U

path cardinality increase removes limitations that might occur when the gNodeB is

connected to the EPC or 5GC networks. Also, with the GTP-U path increase, the maximum

number of S1ULink MO and EP\_NgU MO instances is

increased.

The number of maximum supported S1-U and NG-U GTP-U connections can be configured by

setting the CardinalityLimits.maxS1UPath and

CardinalityLimits.maxNgUPath attributes.

The new S1ULink or EP\_NgU MO instance is created

when the first S1 bearer or PDU session is established. They are established with a

unique pair of the local and remote IP address to the remote Serving Gateway (SGW) or

UPF.

When the MO class cardinality is reached, no more new MO instances are created and the S1

bearer or

PDU

session setup is rejected. The S1ULink and EP\_NgU

MO instances are removed 30 minutes after the last S1 bearer or PDU session using that

link is released or at node restart.

The cardinality of the RpUserPlaneLink MO is also increased.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

Capacity and Performance

The increased number of core network connections has no impact on the number of S1

bearers and PDU sessions used on the node.

Interfaces

This feature causes S1-U cardinality increase on the S1 interface and NG-U

cardinality increase on the NG interface.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 24.2 or later is required for this feature. If Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

The increased number of GTP-U connections might result in ENM performance degradation

and synchronization issues because of Configuration Manager (CM) overload. For

instructions about disabling the S1-U and NG-U CM notifications sent from gNodeB,

contact the ENM Customer Units.

# 5 Parameters for NR Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

The feature introduces MO attributes and increases the cardinality of certain MO

classes.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                    | Type       | Description          |
|------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| CardinalityLimits.maxS1UPath | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| CardinalityLimits.maxNgUPath | Introduced | See MOM description. |

Table 3 shows the maximum number of MO

instances supported on the gNodeB. All MO classes are related to the

GNBCUUPFunction MO.

Limits

| MO Class        | Interface Type                                                                                                   | MO Instance Limit   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| S1ULink         | S1-U                                                                                                             | 0–1800  (1)(2)      |
| EP_NgU          | NG-U                                                                                                             | 0–1800  (2)(3)      |
| RpUserPlaneLink | Xn-U, X2-U                                                                                                       | 1000  (2)(4)        |
| EP_XnU          | Outgoing packet forwarding for UEs connected to 5GC                                                              | 512  (5)            |
| X2ULink         | Outgoing packet forwarding for UEs connected to EPC or for                                         IRAT handover | 400  (5)            |

(1)

The maximum number of MO instances can be configured by

setting the

CardinalityLimits.maxS1UPath

attribute, which overrides the

GNBCUUPFunction MO.

(2)

If the MO instance limit is reached, the bearer

activation or configuration procedures are rejected.

(3)

The maximum number of MO instances can be configured by

setting the

CardinalityLimits.maxNgUPath

attribute, which overrides the MOM

GNBCUUPFunction.

(4)

Internal MO instance limit that overrides MOM

cardinality.

(5)

If the MO instance limit is reached, outgoing packets are

not forwarded.

There is no limit for the number of incoming packet forwarding GTP-U connections.

Also, incoming packet forwarding GTP-U connections do not count towards the node

limit.

The node limit is 4095 for the used GTP-U paths on the Baseband node. The node limit

does not prevent the new MO instance from being created, but the GTP-U path is not

set and the corresponding PDU sessions or S1 bearers are rejected.

The same limits apply for mixed mode Baseband nodes with LTE and NR.

# 6 Performance of NR Increased Number of GTP-U Connections

KPIs

The following KPIs are related to this feature:

- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q2.0: Configurable Maximum Number of S1-U and NG-U Link

The feature enhancement enables the configuration of the maximum number of supported

S1-U and NG-U GTP-U paths.

| Access Type            | NR                                         |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces MOM attributes to configure the maximum number of

S1-U links and NG-U links. It is possible to increase the number of core network

connections to support cloud core network deployments with many UPF or Serving

Gateway (SGW) IP addresses.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- The cardinality increase of S1-U links in EN-DC removes limitations that might occur when the gNodeB is connected to Cloud-based EPC networks.
- The cardinality increase of NG-U links in NR SA removes limitations that might occur when the gNodeB is connected to Cloud-based 5GC networks.

Capacity and Performance

By configuring the CardinalityLimits.maxS1UPath attribute and the

CardinalityLimits.maxNgUPath attribute, the gNodeB can

connect up to 1800 SGW IP addresses and up to 1800 UPF IP addresses

simultaneously.

With the feature enhancement, it is possible to increase the maximum number of

available S1-U or NG-U links, therefore the following KPIs are not degraded:

- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI

More S1ULink and EP\_NgU MO instances increase

the Configuration Management (CM) notification load, which might negatively affect

ENM performance.

More S1ULink and EP\_NgU MO instances increase

the size of PM ROP files.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- CardinalityLimits.maxS1UPath
- CardinalityLimits.maxNgUPath

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version

24.2 or later is required for this feature

enhancement, if the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM

changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
