Summary

In certain geographic areas, different TDD patterns in Mid-Band coexist within the same

bandwidth. The unaligned TDD patterns lead to cross-link interference. The feature

uses downlink slot blanking and downlink symbol blanking to mitigate the downlink to

uplink interference in these areas.

The feature prevents throughput loss due to interference.

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink Slot Blanking for TDD Pattern Coexistence

The feature uses downlink slot blanking and downlink symbol blanking to minimize the

downlink to uplink interference between neighboring cells with conflicting TDD

patterns.

The feature uses the following methods to achieve downlink to uplink interference mitigation:

| Slot blanking   |    | If an uplink and a downlink slot is in conflict, slot blanking is used.                             This means that the whole downlink slot is blanked along with the                             scheduling of the specified slot.                                                                                                        |
|-----------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Symbol blanking |    | If one of the interfering slots is a special slot, symbol blanking is                             used. This means that only the specified downlink OFDM symbols are                             blanked in the interfering slots. This is to minimize the downlink                             throughput loss. Scheduling is unaffected. |

Figure 1   Blanking Method Applications in Conflicting Slots

In the cell with DDDSUUDDDD pattern in each subframe, slot 8 is shortened and slot 9 is

blanked. In the cell with DDDSU pattern in each subframe, slot 3 is shortened and slot 5

is blanked.

In the blanked slots, every OFDM symbol is blank. However, in DDDSU pattern, the OFDM

symbol structure in the shortened slots is different in 10:2:2 and 11:3:0 special slot

configurations. For more information on different TDD patterns and special slot

configurations, see Control Channel Guideline NR.

The following examples show the symbol structure of affected slots in certain special

slot configurations.

Impact on Signaling

Regardless of special slot configurations, certain signaling elements are moved to a

specified unaffected slot to avoid being blanked by the feature.

| Cell Pattern   | Signaling Element   | Moved From       | Moved To           |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| DDDSUUDDDD     | Paging              | Slots 2, 6, 7, 9 | Slots 6, 7, 8, 11  |
| DDDSUUDDDD     | CSI-RS              | Slots 8, 18      | Slots 2, 12        |
| DDDSU          | Paging              | Slots 2, 3, 6, 7 | Slots 6, 7, 11, 18 |
| DDDSU          | Type 0 PDCCH CSS    | Slots 4, 5       | Slots 10, 11       |

# 4 Network Impact of Downlink Slot Blanking for TDD Pattern Coexistence

To prevent the uplink throughput loss in a specific cell, the feature decreases the

peak downlink throughput in the interfering cell.

Capacity and Performance

The following changes can be observed in the affected cells:

- Peak downlink throughput is decreased proportionally to the number of blanked OFDM symbols and TDD slots.
- Uplink throughput is recovered. Better uplink performance can affect downlink RLC retransmissions. This improves the downlink performance of the cell. In certain cases, the downlink improvement in the victim cell can be higher than the peak throughput loss in the interfering cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of NR Downlink Slot Blanking for TDD Pattern Coexistence

Counters

The feature introduces the NRCellDU.tddBorderVersion MO attribute

and the NRCellDU.pmRadioMaxDeltaIpNDistr counter. To avoid an

imbalanced trade-off between peak downlink throughput loss and uplink throughput

recovery, it is recommended to configure the feature only if the

NRCellDU.pmRadioMaxDeltaIpNDistr counter measures at least 3

dB in either cell. The NRCellDU.pmRadioMaxDeltaIpNDistr counter

can be monitored even if the feature is not enabled on any given node. This makes it

possible to select the nodes that are affected by cross-link interference. For more

information on the NRCellDU.pmRadioMaxDeltaIpNDistr counter, see

the MOM description.

The feature decreases the value of the NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailDl

and NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailPdcch PM counters.

The feature decreases the value of the pmEbsMacRBSymAvailPdcch EBS

counter.

For more information on EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Downlink Slot Blanking for TDD Pattern Coexistence

If the measured delta interference plus noise reaches a certain value, the feature

must be configured in both interfering cells to operate properly.

The feature minimizes the downlink to uplink interference between neighboring cells with

conflicting TDD pattern deployments. For the feature to operate properly, both patterns

must be adapted. This means that the NRCellDU.tddBorderVersion

attribute must be configured in both interfering cells.

A trade-off must be considered before configuration. With the feature operational, peak

downlink throughput is decreased proportionally to the number of blanked OFDM symbols

and TDD slots. However, the uplink throughput loss caused by the interference is

recovered.

To avoid an imbalanced trade-off between peak downlink throughput loss and uplink

throughput recovery, it is recommended to configure the feature only if the

NRCellDU.pmRadioMaxDeltaIpNDistr counter measures at least 3 dB

in either cell. However, different circumstances can affect the threshold. These

circumstances can be, for example, radio unit overheating, external interference, or

normal traffic of neighboring cells. The

NRCellDU.pmRadioMaxDeltaIpNDistr counter monitors the delta

interference and noise between the affected uplink slots and the unaffected uplink

slots. Monitoring this counter is important for identifying the need to differ from the

recommendation.

## 8.1 Configure TDD Border Version

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState MO attribute to LOCKED.
2. Set the NRCellDU.tddBorderVersion MO attribute to VERSION\_1. Note: Setting the NRCellDU.tddBorderVersion MO attribute to other values causes the feature to be disabled.
3. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState MO attribute to UNLOCKED.
