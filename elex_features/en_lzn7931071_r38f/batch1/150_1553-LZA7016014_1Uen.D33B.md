## 2.2 Technical Impact Analysis

The goal of this task is to analyze the current state of the RAN and identify the

activities needed to prepare the RAN for the deployment of non-connected mode

Instantaneous Licensing. It is recommended to document all findings of this analysis in

a Technical Solution Impact Analysis report.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

Hardware and Software Readiness

Analyze the readiness of the radio network and identify the impact by comparing the

revisions of the hardware and software with the prerequisites stated in Instantaneous Licensing.

Commercial Readiness

Analyze the commercial readiness of the RAN and identify if there are following

fingerprints:

- The fingerprints with entitlements are activated from more than one EUFT group. In such cases, identified fingerprints and entitlements must be cleaned up before migration to Instantaneous Licensing.
- The fingerprints include licenses which are wrongly activated or include licenses which are not compliant with LCS and HCS definitions as follows: Wrong price model for HWACs Multiple or wrong payment models Inconsistent base package or value package sets Overactivation of HWACs or capacity license objects Old licenses or HWACs, for example, DU licenses Restricted features It is recommended to perform ELIS clean-up for all identified nodes.

Radio Node Configuration Types

Analyze the radio node configuration types in the network and how they might benefit

from Instantaneous Licensing by doing the following:

- Compare the radio node types with the Instantaneous Licensing support that is offered for different RATs in the given RAN software release.
- Study the supported radio node configurations and limitations in the given RAN software release.

## 2.3 Operational Impact Analysis

The goal of this task is to analyze the operational impact of Instantaneous Licensing. It

is recommended to document all findings of this analysis in an Operation Solution

Deployment Analysis report.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

Impact on Operation

Analyze how operation is affected for the following cases:

- Additional radio node hardware or software configurations are introduced and updates of the License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) are required.
- Radio nodes are introduced, replaced, migrated, moved, upgraded, or reconfigured and handling of related licenses is affected.
- Communication about changes required in the network to support Instantaneous Licensing interactions.
- Communication about changes of LCSs and HCSs between operator and Ericsson.
- Support procedures for alarms or errors Note: In some scenarios, such as emergency unlock, return of licenses, and for unsupported products or standards, a manual request of license keys is required.

Impact on Responsible Roles in the Organization

Analyze and identify responsible roles in the organization for the following

areas:

- Software Asset Manager, IL Manager, and SSP-LKM
- License Key Request generation using ENM Flow Automation
- Support procedures

The non-connected mode Instantaneous Licensing deployment plan is created based on the

findings in the Technical Impact Analysis and the

Operational Impact Analysis. The deployment

plan includes the following:

- Tasks to be performed and timing.
- Resources required to secure the necessary operational and technical preparation.
- Phasing and timing for deployment, including lab trials, limited field trials, and full deployment.

# 3 Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Solution Design

The required HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) and License Configuration Sets (LCSs) are

created and network configurations are prepared.

The goal of this task is to design a commercial strategy for the Instantaneous Licensing

solution in the radio network.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

## 3.1 Create HCSs and LCSs for the Radio Network

The goal of this task is to create the required License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and

Hardware Configuration Sets (HCSs) for the nodes in the radio network based on the

Technical Solution Impact Analysis created in Technical Impact Analysis.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

### 3.1.1 Define HWAC Configuration Sets

All HWAC configurations for an EUFT can be managed within one Baseband-HCS, but it might

lead to an overconsumption of entitlements. It is recommended that the configuration of

HCSs is balanced between having fewer HCSs, and minimizing overconsumption.

Configuration also depends on the type of commercial agreement in place. The following

aspects must be considered:

- Product types used in the network, for example Baseband 5216 and Baseband 6630
- Mix of RATs on a product, for example Baseband 6630 LTE, Baseband 6630 NR, and nodes with both LTE and NR.
- Separate pricing model or different default capacity on a product. For example, Baseband 6630 LTE ABW and Baseband 6630 LTE ABW + Massive MIMO might require a separate HCS.Note: Mixed ABW and Massive MIMO pricing models can coexist.

### 3.1.2 Define HWAC Configuration Set Details

Based on the HWAC Configuration Set (HCS), the common and variable parts for each HCS

must be defined as follows:

| Common part   |    | Defines the set of HWACs that is activated on a given Baseband unit and                             given RAT. The common part can contain several HWACs of any                             capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Variable part |    | Defines which HUP size is activated on the request of the node. The                             variable part specifies which HUP is used to fill the gap between the                             level that is activated from the initial package and the common part of                             Baseband HCS, and the level that the node requests. Multiple HUPs can be                             specified for a given Baseband type and given RAT. This results in a HUP                             set with the lowest overall cost. This configuration is recommended, as                             it allows network management through a single HCS. |

### 3.1.3 Define License Configuration Sets

Based on the node configuration in the radio network, the required License Configuration

Sets (LCSs) must be defined as follows:

- The goal is to define a single LCS to manage all nodes in the network. The use of multiple LCSs might cause problems if the wrong LCS is selected during node integration or migration to Instantaneous Licensing. In addition, migration between several LCSs is not a fully automated procedure and manual handling is required for license return.
- Fewer LCSs are required in the following cases: Different Baseband HCSs are defined A fixed quantity is set for licenses or HWACs Various fixed values are required because of node configuration

### 3.1.4 Define Special Activation Rules

Determine if special activation rules are required based on the node configuration in the

radio network. The following aspects must be considered:

- It is recommended to avoid the use of special activation rules to maintain simplicity within the deployment.
- If required by contract, it is possible to activate selected HWACs with a defined quantity based on the RAN Compute Unit connected to the radio node. This setting is applicable for all nodes managed by Instantaneous Licensing.
- If necessary within the Instantaneous Licensing solution, new special activation rules must be requested manually. Operators might request rules, such as the activation of licenses and HWACs in advance to avoid licensing issues during expansion.

It is recommended to document all defined LCSs and HCSs in a Licensing

Configuration Definition report, which can later be shared with the

operator.

# 4 Order Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Solution

The goal of this task is to order the required access rights and configure the required

data for Instantaneous Licensing migration.

## 4.1 Order SAM Access

The goal of this task is to order access to Software Asset Management (SAM), which is

used to configure Instantaneous Licensing.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

The order procedure consists of the following steps:

- The Customer Unit orders the access rights to SAM using an Ericsson internal tool.
- The operator is onboarded through a standard process, using the identity life cycle management application ISIGNUM. ISIGNUM is available through Extranet support.

The Customer Unit can apply for access rights that allow the following:

- Configuring Instantaneous Licensing
- Migrating hardware to Instantaneous Licensing
- Reading the configuration of IL Manager

Operators can apply for access rights to read configurations in IL Manager, which is part

of SAM.

## 4.2 ELIS Preparation

The goal of this task is to prepare the data in Ericsson License System (ELIS) for

the deployment of the Instantaneous Licensing solution.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

Based on the Technical Solution Impact Analysis, the Customer Unit performs

the following tasks:

1. Manually orders LKFs at the license key expiration date if the Term-Based Licensing (TBL) payment model is chosen. The Instantaneous Licensing solution does not update the end dates of license keys and a manual request is required to extend them.
2. Ensures that the entitlements stock in Ericsson Electronic Licensing Solution (ELIS) reflects the License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) definitions defined in the Licensing Configuration Definition report. If there is a shortage, additional items must be ordered.
3. Returns fingerprints with entitlements activated in more than one EUFT group if the radio nodes are manually connected to a single operator EUFT.
4. For all identified fingerprints that have wrongly activated licenses or have licenses not compliant with LCS and HCS definitions, clean-up in ELIS must be done. Instantaneous Licensing supports an optional method to sort out such problems automatically by performing LKF clean-up at migration to Instantaneous Licensing.

# 5 Migrate to Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing

The necessary applications and ENM flows are prepared and the migration is executed.

## 5.1 Initialize SAM

The goal of this task is to configure Software Asset Management (SAM) for

Instantaneous Licensing.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

## 5.3 Migrate Baseband Radio Node with Selected Licensing Strategy

After the migration process is completed, the final steps ensure that Instantaneous

Licensing operates according to project specifications.

The goal of this task is to migrate existing radio nodes in a radio network to the

Instantaneous Licensing solution and to allocate them to a specific licensing

strategy.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

The following options are available:

- Migration in IL Manager
- Migration with ELIS clean-up
- Migration to another LCS

### 5.3.1 Migration in IL Manager

Steps

The following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:

1. Create a list of fingerprints and License Configuration Set (LCS) IDs for the radio nodes that are intended to be controlled by Instantaneous Licensing. The list is created together with the operator.
2. Migrate one or multiple hardware resources from the list to Instantaneous Licensing using one of the following methods: A hardware resource is migrated individually from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Single Migration option. Multiple hardware resources are migrated in batch from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Batch Migration option. A Migration File Template can be downloaded and used for batch migrations.
3. Verify the status of the hardware resources by using the Request Status option. Note: A status report can be downloaded as an Excel sheet.
4. Confirm Software Asset Management (SAM) and Instantaneous Licensing readiness.
5. Locate LKF files by searching for the fingerprints in SSP-LKF Portal &gt; Search Key &amp; FS. For Single Migration: use Search criteria &gt; Detailed search. For Batch Migration: use Search criteria &gt; File based. As for input, the same Migration File Template can be used.

The following steps are performed by the operator:

6. Import the LKF to ENM SHM and install it on selected network elements. For detailed instructions, see section Manage License Key Files in Software Hardware Manager.
7. Set the connection mode on target radio nodes to OFFLINE\_MODE.

### 5.3.2 Migration with ELIS Clean-Up

The goal of this task is to perform automated LKF clean-up activity at migration to

Instantaneous Licensing.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

Steps

The following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:

1. Create a list of fingerprints and License Configuration Set (LCS) IDs for the radio nodes that are intended to be controlled by the Instantaneous Licensing feature. The list is created together with the operator.
2. Migrate one or multiple hardware resources from the list to Instantaneous Licensing using one of the following methods: A hardware resource is migrated individually from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Single Migration option. Multiple hardware resources are migrated in batch from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Batch Migration option. A Migration File Template can be downloaded and used for batch migrations.
3. Verify the status of the hardware resources by using the Request Status option. Note: A status report can be downloaded as an Excel sheet.
4. Confirm Software Asset Management (SAM) and Instantaneous Licensing readiness
5. Configure the LKF clean-up exemption in IL Manager by providing a list of fingerprints which are to be cleaned up. If all fingerprints in the network require clean-up, the exemption must be set at the EUFT level.

The following steps are performed by the operator:

6. Generate an LRF with License Demand Content set to FULL\_DEMAND, submit it to SSP-LKM and download the LKF.
7. Import the LKF to ENM SHM and install it on selected network elements. For detailed instructions, see the section Manage License Key Files in Software Hardware Manager.
8. Set the connection mode on target radio nodes to OFFLINE\_MODE.

### 5.3.3 Migration to Another LCS

This task involves activities, some of which are performed on the radio node by

Customer Engineer and some are performed in IL Manager by the Customer Unit. These

steps need to be coordinated throughout the following flow.

Steps

The following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:

1. Disconnect the radio node from the LCS by using the HW Resources to LCS section in the IL Manager. For more information, see IL Manager User Guide.
2. Submit an ELAS support ticket for a manual clean-up in ELIS if required. Wait until a new LKF is generated.
3. Connect the radio node to the LCS by using the HW Resources to LCS section in the IL Manager.

The following step is performed by Customer Engineer:

4. Optional: Set the ENodeBFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget and the GNBDUFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget attributes if a radio node is migrated to LCS with the throughput price model.

The following step is performed by the Customer Unit:

5. Perform LKF regenerate for selected fingerprints and specify LKF Receivers in SSP-LKM.

The following step is performed by Customer Engineer:

6. Download the LKF Package and install LKFs on radio nodes. Note: This procedure is valid for migrating a node to another LCS by using the same price model in LCSs. Step 1 cannot be performed when only the Integration LKF is created. An ELAS ticket for manual support must be created to return license resources and disable a node in ELIS. When this is completed, an Integration LKF can be recreated.

# 6 Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Migration Troubleshooting

This troubleshooting section provides guidance in case errors or alarms occur and

migration cannot be completed.

## 6.1 ENM

Fingerprint Uniqueness

ENM cannot ensure fingerprint uniqueness in all cases. The operator is responsible

for fingerprint uniqueness. If duplicate fingerprints exist in the network, LKF

generation in Electronic License Information System (ELIS) might fail.

## 6.2 Baseband Radio Node

Synchronization between ENM and the Radio Node

Check the synchronization status in the ENM Command Line

Interface by using command: cmedit get &lt;node name&gt; --

syncstatus

Example:

```
>>cmedit get SELIITRBS01293 -- syncstatus
FDN : Subnetwork=NS_Cluster, MeContext= SELIITRBS01293 syncStatus : 
SYNCHRONIZED
```

If the node is not synchronized, troubleshoot the connection according to the

instructions in ENM Configuration Troubleshooting Guide.

## 6.3 Flow Automation

When a License Request File (LRF) Activation flow is executed in ENM Flow Automation, the

execution section in the report page shows a summary, and error descriptions if a radio

node fails to generate an LRF.

When problems found in the error description are resolved, the ENM flow must be executed

again for the affected nodes.

## 6.4 SSP-LKM

When transactions in SSP-LKM are completed, a report with information about encountered

errors can be downloaded.

The SSP-LKM User Guide provides instruction on how to handle errors.

External users are provided with list of errors with instruction how to resolve them.

For errors that the user cannot resolve, contact the next level of Ericsson support.

When the error is resolved, the LRF must be resubmitted to SSP-LKM.
