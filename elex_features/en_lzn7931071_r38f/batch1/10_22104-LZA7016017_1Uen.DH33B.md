# 1 NR Micro Sleep Tx Overview

NR Micro Sleep Tx is an energy efficiency feature. It saves energy by disabling the

power amplifier if there is low traffic in downlink.

Summary

NR Micro Sleep Tx decreases energy consumption in the radios of the node. The feature switches

off power amplifiers to save energy. Switching off occurs on a symbol-time basis,

when no user data needs to be transmitted in the downlink.

NR Micro Sleep Tx enables discontinuous transmission in the downlink to save energy during low

traffic. With this feature, there is minimal power emission during OFDM symbols that

are not used for user data transmission. The NR downlink transmission formats are

kept intact. These formats are the following:

- CSI-RS
- PSS
- SSS
- PBCH

NR Micro Sleep Tx automatically enables and disables the main power amplifier in the radio.

The power amplifier is turned off in the following cases:

- No PDSCH traffic is scheduled on a subframe.
- No PDSCH traffic is scheduled during symbols that do not carry mandatory information.

NR Micro Sleep Tx is a non-license-controlled feature. Once it is activated, it cannot be

deactivated.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Micro Sleep Tx

The Energy Metering feature monitors the energy consumption of the radio unit. In

this way, the energy gain of the NR Micro Sleep Tx feature can be measured.

Limitations

The combination of three or more standards is supported. A

combination of the following standards is supported:

- ESS
- GSM
- LTE
- NB-IoT
- NR

The power-saving benefit of the feature might be lower on some Radio 8843 units

compared to other radio units.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Micro Sleep Tx

The NR Micro Sleep Tx feature operates automatically. It turns off the power

amplifier if there is no downlink data transmission.

Operational Process

The radio unit performs actual power saving by turning off the power amplifier when

there is no downlink data transmission. The functionality runs on a Radio Frequency

(RF) port-basis in each supported radio type and configuration.

The feature enables and disables the main power amplifier of the radio by turning the

gate bias on and off. Switching is based on a symbol-duration timescale. The power

amplifier is turned off for each symbol if there is no downlink data transmission.

In each case, the Baseband unit indicates if the radio can turn off the power

amplifier.

To turn off power amplifiers, the following conditions must apply:

- There is no data transmission on any of the carriers using the same RF port.
- The Single Mode Multiple Carriers configuration is used. The data is transmitted through multiple aggregated carriers in a single mode configuration.

If data is transmitted on at least one carrier, the power amplifiers of the

corresponding RF port are in operation.

SSB-Based VSWR Measurements

The SSB-based VSWR measurements function replaces the dummy burst transmission of

injected messages with SSB transmissions for VSWR measurements to decrease power

consumption. This function also reduces the number of resource elements that are

used for VSWR measurements to reduce inter-cell interference.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Micro Sleep Tx

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The NRSectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime pm counter measures the

time in seconds when no power is indicated to the radio.

The following PM counters monitor the total time and ratio Tx branches are

switched off in radio units capable of reporting it, regardless of radio node

configurations and activated sleep features:

- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffTime
- RadioProcessing.pmTxOffRatio
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime1
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime2
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime3
- Transceiver.pmTxOffTime4
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio1
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio2
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio3
- Transceiver.pmTxOffRatio4

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## Appendix A.b: 23.Q1: Observability Enhancement for NR Micro Sleep TX

This feature enhancement provides observability of the possible sleep time at the

NRSectorCarrier for the NR Micro Sleep TX

feature.

| Feature Name           | NR Micro Sleep TX   |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4900        |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package     |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | NR                  |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

The enhancement gives an indication about the possible power saving resulted from the

Micro Sleep TX feature as the observed sleep time per sector carrier can be

different from the actual sleep time in the radio.

FR2 High-Band is not supported.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The NRSectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime pm counter is introduced

which measures the time in seconds when no power is indicated to the radio.

The NRSectorCarrier.pmMicroTxSleepTime pm counter is accurate only

for the specific carrier configuration of the specific TX branches.

If more than one carrier is configured on the specific TX branches, the hardware

related to those TX branches can only be switched off by the radio when none of the

carriers are transmitting at a given time.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 23.1 or later is required for this feature.
