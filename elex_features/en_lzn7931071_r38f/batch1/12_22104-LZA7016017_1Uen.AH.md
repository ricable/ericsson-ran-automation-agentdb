Summary

The NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity introduces the NR carrier capacity licenses

configured on the gNodeB, for mid-band or low-band. Carrier

frequency configuration is less than or equal to 6 GHz. For TDD and FDD

configuration, one licensed capacity unit is required for every 10-MHz bandwidth.

Enough license units have to be available on the node when unlocking a sector

carrier. Otherwise, the unlock operation is not successful.

The NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity is automatically activated when the gNodeB receives a software upgrade. License activation is

not needed for this capacity. The capacity cannot be deactivated once it is

activated as a result of a node software upgrade.

# 2 Dependencies of NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity has no dependencies to other features, but is related to the gNodeB capacity.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No special hardware requirement is expected for this capacity.

Limitations

The NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier capacity is related to the overall node capacity.

Network Requirements

This capacity does not have specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity allocates licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units.

Enough licensed capacity units must be available on the gNodeB

before setting the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState to

UNLOCKED. Otherwise the unlock operation is not successful.

During carrier capacity evaluation, the gNodeB compares the

number of required and available capacity units. The licensed capacity limit as defined

in the valid license key is checked against the value set in the

CapacityState.currentCapacityLimit attribute. Figure 1 shows the carrier capacity evaluation

process.

## 3.1 Calculating the Required Capacity Units for TDD

The 5+5 MHz channel bandwidth is the capacity granularity when the sector carrier is

configured for frequency bands of 6 GHz or less. Capacity granularity applies to each

sector for each gNodeB.

The operator can calculate the required number of 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units

for one sector carrier with the following formula:

The NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL and the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL attributes must be set to equal

values. The &lt;configured TDD channel bandwidth&gt; is determined by the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL attribute as the two attributes

must be set to different values in FDD.

The formula applies when the NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL attribute is set

to a value that places the radio channel at or below 6 GHz.

As an example, if the &lt;configured TDD channel bandwidth&gt; is 20 MHz, two

capacity units are required. If the &lt;configured TDD channel bandwidth&gt;

is 100 MHz, 10 capacity units are required.

## 3.2 Calculating the Required Capacity Units for FDD

The 5+5 MHz channel bandwidth is the capacity granularity when the sector carrier is

configured for frequency bands of 6 GHz or less. Capacity granularity applies to each

sector for each gNodeB.

The operator can use the following formula to calculate the required number of 5+5 MHz

sector carrier capacity units for one sector carrier:

The &lt;configured FDD channel bandwidth&gt; is a sum of the

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL and

NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL attributes.

For downlink-only cells the NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL attribute is

not applicable, set the value to 0 in the above formula.

The formula applies when the NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL attribute is set

to a value that places the radio channel at or below 6 GHz.

As an example, if the &lt;configured FDD channel bandwidth&gt; is 20 MHz, two

capacity units are required. If the &lt;configured FDD channel bandwidth&gt;

is 100 MHz, 10 capacity units are required.

## 3.3 Operational Process of NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

### 3.3.1 Checking 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity

The operator can get information about the 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity of the node by

checking the CapacityState.currentCapacityLimit attribute value.

### 3.3.2 Allocating 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units

When unlocking a sector carrier, the node checks if there are sufficient available 5+5

MHz sector carrier capacity units. The following outcomes are possible:

- If there are sufficient available licenses, the gNodeB allocates the 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units to the sector carrier. The sector carrier unlock procedure continues.
- If the available 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units are insufficient for the sector carrier, the sector carrier unlock operation fails. The MO Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the Key alarm is triggered.

### 3.3.3 Releasing 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity Units

When locking a sector carrier, the 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated to the

sector carrier are released and returned to the pool.

### 3.3.4 Changing 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier Capacity

The number of 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units can be changed by the following

methods when a new LKF is installed:

- If the new LKF allows a lower number of 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units than the allocated license, the activated sector carriers stay in service. However, unlocking a new sector carrier is not allowed because of license allocation failure. To release the amount of units matching the new license capacity, the operator can select sector carriers to be locked.
- If the new LKF allows more 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units, the operator can unlock more sector carriers. After the installation, the gNodeB runs the automatic recovery process of the sector carriers that failed to unlock.

### 3.3.5 Automatic Recovery Process

When a new license key with more 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units is installed on

the gNodeB, the gNodeB attempts

automatic recovery. The conditions for automatic recovery are the following:

- The operator tried to unlock the sector carrier.
- The sector carrier raised an alarm because of the shortage of licensed capacity units.
- The NRSectorCarrier.operationalState attribute has the DISABLED value.

The automatic recovery unlocks as many failed sector carriers as the new capacity

enables. The sector carriers that are not unlocked by the automatic recovery still have

the DISABLED value, and the alarm is raised on them.

When set to LOCKED, all allocated capacity units                                 are released in the sector carrier. |

# 6 Performance of NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity introduces new counters to measure the number of allocated 5+5 MHz

sector carrier capacity units. There are no associated KPIs or events.

KPIs

This capacity has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This capacity introduces the following counters:

- GNBDUFunction.pmLic5Plus5MHzScActualNote: This counter shows the current number of licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated to all sector carriers. If the gNodeB does not have unlocked sector carriers, the counter reports 0 value.
- GNBDUFunction.pmLic5Plus5MHzScTddNote: This counter shows the current number of licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated to all TDD sector carriers. If the gNodeB does not have unlocked TDD sector carriers, the counter reports 0 value.
- GNBDUFunction.pmLic5Plus5MHzScFddNote: This counter shows the current number of licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units allocated to all FDD sector carriers. If the gNodeB does not have unlocked FDD sector carriers, the counter reports 0 value.

Events

This capacity has no associated events.

# 7 Enable or Disable Capacity

While license-controlled features need to be individually activated, capacities are

automatically enabled when the License Key File is installed on a node. Capacity cannot

be deactivated once it is enabled on the node.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR 5+5 MHz Sector Carrier

The capacity enforces the 5+5 MHz sector carrier license rules with software

upgrade.

Software Upgrade

The 5+5 MHz sector carrier license rules are immediately enforced to the radio node

as part of an upgrade. This is because of the upgrade as node restart results in

unlocked cells and sector carriers. To avoid network disturbance, operators need to

have a clear upgrade strategy for each gNodeB. The following

high-level process is recommended:

1. Add 5+5 MHz sector carrier licenses to each customer bulk in Ericsson License Information System.
2. Download new LKFs which contain the number of licensed 5+5 MHz sector carrier capacity units depending on the customer contract.
3. Deploy the new LKFs before downloading the software.
4. Ensure that all LKFs are updated before rolling out the software.
