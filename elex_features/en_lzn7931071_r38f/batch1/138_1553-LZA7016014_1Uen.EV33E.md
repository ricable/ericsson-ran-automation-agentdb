# 1 Reader's Guide

Welcome to the All-in-One User Guide for Mixed Mode. The purpose of this document is to

present different aspects of Mixed Mode in a comprehensive manner, from basic

definitions, through feature descriptions, through initial configuration and O&amp;M

procedures.

As a new all-in-one format, this document replaces the Mixed Mode feature descriptions,

Manage Mixed Mode, and Mixed Mode Guidelines.

Target Readers

The All-In-One User Guide is not dedicated to a single group of users. Instead, it

can serve several different user groups, as individual sections are applicable in

different stages of the operational

flow.

# 2 Introduction to Mixed Mode

What is Mixed Mode?

The term Mixed Mode is used to describe a configuration where multiple

Managed Elements (MEs) share traffic-bearing equipment, or where one ME represents

multiple standards. When resources are shared this way, fewer pieces of equipment

are necessary to achieve the same level of performance, reducing footprint,

complexity, and, ultimately, cost.

The Mixed Mode function is enabled by the following features:

- Mixed Mode Radio, where at least one of the following conditions applies: Multiple standards from different radio nodes, represented by MEs, use the same radio unit. Multiple standards from a single radio node use the same rfPort on the radio unit. One standard is handled by two different radio nodes.
- Mixed Mode Baseband, where multiple standards, represented by Managed Functions (MFs), share a single radio node.
- Mixed Mode Baseband R, where a mixed mode configuration is enabled through a three-splitter Baseband R unit. Maximum two separate MEs can be connected to the three separate splitter blocks of the same Baseband R using mixed mode.

Mixed mode configurations can be customized according to operator needs. It is

possible to use a combination of single mode and mixed mode radio units and RAN

Compute units.

When to Use Mixed Mode?

The primary use of Mixed Mode is to enable:

- A more efficient radio node management through a single ME, when Mixed Mode Baseband is combined with Mixed Mode Radio.
- The modernization of sites through more capable hardware: replacing single-standard equipment with multistandard equipment, such as radio units and RAN Compute units.
- A more efficient use of HW to minimize energy consumption.
- The introduction of a new standard in an existing or new spectrum.
- The introduction of Ericsson Spectrum Sharing, giving full flexibility to share NR and LTE on a 1-millisecond Transmission Time Interval (TTI) basis.
- The migration or reallocation of existing spectrum, making it possible to move spectrum from one standard to another stepwise, also known as spectrum reframing
- The densification of multistandard networks.

## 2.1 Mixed Mode Configurations

When moving from a single standard environment to a mixed mode environment, the

configuration process depends on the standard that already exists in the system and on what

the target configuration is. Expanding the number of standards running in a mixed mode

environment is possible as well.

Mixed Mode Radio and Mixed Mode Baseband licenses for the RATs required by a certain

mixed mode configuration needs to be installed properly in the node. Otherwise, the

granted capacity limits might not match the capacity modules defined for each RAT in

this configuration, or the unlock of sector carriers or Trxs failure might be

detected.

From Single Standard to Mixed Mode Baseband

In this basic procedure, a configuration that consists of a RAN Compute unit with

single standard radio units is expanded with radio units of a different standard.

The RAN Compute unit configured with Mixed Mode Baseband now runs two standards.

Figure 1   From Single to Mixed Mode Baseband

From Single Standard to Mixed Mode Radio

In this procedure, a configuration that consists of a RAN Compute unit and a radio

unit is expanded with another RAN Compute unit. The RAN Compute unit is connected to

the radio, which is configured to run more than one standard at the same time.

Figure 2   From Single to Mixed Mode Radio

From Single Standard to Mixed Mode Baseband and Mixed Mode Radio

In this procedure, a configuration that consists of a RAN Compute unit and multiple

radio units is expanded with additional standards in the RAN Compute unit and the

radio units as well. No additional equipment is required, the radio or radio units

and the RAN Compute unit are configured to run the newly added standard.

Figure 3   From Single to Mixed Mode Baseband and Mixed Mode Radio

From Single Standard to Mixed Mode Baseband R503

In this procedure, a Baseband R503 unit is added to a configuration that consists of

one or more RAN Compute units and one or more radio units. It is possible that the

other units are all single standard, and only the Baseband R503 acts as shared

equipment. However, it is also possible that all units in the configuration are

mixed mode units.

### 2.2.1 Shared Equipment

A shared equipment configuration is when more than one ME uses equipment such as a

radio unit, antenna, RET, Baseband R unit, or the support system.

Shared equipment must run a software revision that is compatible with the software

running on all MEs that share the equipment. A common shared equipment case is MORAN,

where two or more operators have separate RAN Compute units but share radio

equipment.

The following shared equipment is common in a mixed mode configuration:

- Shared radio unit
- Shared antenna system
- Shared fronthaul equipment
- Shared support system Note: It is possible that an external alarm is raised for all of the MEs that share the support system but the alarm is only relevant for one of the MEs.

#### 2.2.1.1 Shared Radio Unit

A shared radio unit can be used for both singe standard mode and mixed mode, managed

by multiple nodes.

Figure 5   Configuration Examples with Shared Radio

For the supported radio configurations and carrier allocations, see Radio Node Configurations.

When shared radio units are used in a mixed mode radio configuration, the individual

carriers have separate configurations. Mixed mode radio sectors are configured in the

MEs that share the radio unit by selecting an RBB that supports shared radio units.

The available output power must be allocated among the nodes and standards that share a

radio unit. The available output power depends on the capacity of a radio unit and the

number of HWACs used for each node. Output power is configured for each sector carrier

or TX/RX for each standard respectively. Radio power sharing must be planned in advance,

and no more than 100% of the total available power in a radio unit can be allocated. For

more information on how to configure radio power sharing, see Manage Radio Network.

When a radio unit is shared, the following factors must be considered:

- Bandwidth
- Frequency band
- Spectrum

Spectrum can be shared between standards or separate for each standard.

Carrier Allocation on a Shared AIR Unit

Carrier allocation on a shared AIR unit might fail in the following cases:

- If any of the RAN Compute units starts later than 30 seconds after the previous unit
- If any of the RAN Compute units establishes a connection to the AIR unit later than 30 seconds after the previous unit
- If an additional carrier is configured on the AIR later than 30 seconds after the previous unit

In such cases, the cells on the AIR unit might be disabled and the

Resource Allocation Failure alarm is raised.

To resolve the alarm, one of the following actions is needed:

- The Field Replaceable Unit MO instance representing the AIR unit must be locked and unlocked.
- All carriers connected to the AIR unit must be locked. Then, all carriers must be unlocked.
- The AIR unit must be restarted.

#### 2.2.1.2 Shared Antenna System

In a configuration with multiple MEs that share radio resources, the antenna system

is also shared. The management and supervision of the antenna system resources is performed

by the MEs.

The MEs sharing a common antenna system must be configured in a way that maximum antenna

control and supervision is achieved. If multiple MEs share the antenna and the RF port,

they must be configured so that only one of them controls the TMA, the RET and the power

of the RF port. Optimal configuration depends on the standards in the mixed mode

configuration, and the types of antenna function that is controlled and supervised.

Antenna configuration data must be configured in all MEs, except in the following

cases:

- If an ATMA is used, the uplink gain is read from the ATMA. This means that the uplink gain does not need to be explicitly configured in the controlling system. However, the corresponding uplink gain must also be reflected in the other system. Only one system can control the ATMA.
- If an ASC is used, the uplink gain, uplink delay, downlink delay, and downlink attenuation are read from the ASC. This means that they do not need to be explicitly configured in the controlling system. However, the corresponding values must also be reflected in the other system.

When a RET is shared in a multistandard configuration, the antenna tilt is applied to all

standards.

#### 2.2.1.3 Shared Fronthaul Equipment

Mixed Mode Baseband R

Mixed Mode Baseband R is a basic feature that provides flexible configurations and

hardware-efficient deployments, allowing full use of hardware resources and savings

on deployment cost. The feature allows two separate MEs to share three splitters in

one Baseband R. Two MEs can be synchronized through Node Group Synchronization in a

shared Baseband R.

The Mixed Mode Baseband R feature has the following requirements:

- ENM version 18.1 or later.
- The installed software for the respective radio standards must support Mixed Mode Baseband R.
- Node Group Synchronization must be configured properly.

For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.

A node with Mixed Mode Baseband R can be configured with the

FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute.

Mixed Mode Baseband R configuration must meet the following guidelines:

- The two MEs must be synchronized because the Baseband R unit has only one clock domain. The synchronization path has to go through the shared Baseband R or through the additional shared radio. For more information, see Manage Node Group Synchronization. Mixed Mode Baseband R can be connected to the following hardware units: RAN Compute unit using any single standard RAN Compute unit using Mixed Mode Baseband

Shared Radio Gateway

In a mixed mode configuration, two MEs can share one or more radio units through a

shared Radio Gateway. The shared radio unit or units can be directly connected to

the Radio Gateway, or part of a cascade chain. In addition, the shared Radio Gateway

allows converting eCPRI connections to CPRI connections.

For the supported configuration with shared Radio Gateway, see Radio Node Configurations.

For the configuration procedure, see Configure Shared Radio Gateway.

##### 2.2.1.3.1 Configure Mixed Mode Baseband R503

Mixed Mode Baseband R must be used with the Node Group Synchronization solution. For

more information, see Node Group Synchronization Benefits.

To configure the node with the Mixed Mode Baseband R feature for the first time:

Steps

1. Connect the Baseband R to one of the MEs. Leave the other ME disconnected or delete the link to it.
2. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute to true in the MO that represents the Baseband R.
3. Upgrade the ME to the release that supports this feature.
4. Delete, then create the link to the Baseband R to activate the Mixed Mode Baseband R feature.
5. Upgrade the other ME to the release that supports this feature.
6. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute to true in the MO that represents the Baseband R on the ME to be connected to the Baseband R.
7. Connect the ME to the Baseband R.

#### 2.2.1.4 Software Management for Shared Equipment

When multiple radio nodes share equipment, the software running on the nodes and on

the shared equipment must be compatible. Because of this, a software upgrade might be

necessary.

Software upgrade or rollback procedures must be coordinated with all other radio nodes

that share the equipment, because the process requires the equipment to be restarted.

This temporarily takes the equipment out of operation, which disrupts traffic for all

nodes that share it.

For more information on software upgrade, see Manage Software.

Software Compatibility

Compatibility between software releases varies from one standard to another. If it is

required to upgrade software to a version outside the compatibility window of its

current version, the upgrade must be done in multiple steps. For detailed

information and possible deviations in upgrade paths and compatibility windows, see

release notes for the radio node software.

Software Upgrade of Shared Equipment

In a configuration with shared equipment, a software upgrade might affect all MEs and

all standards using the shared equipment. The impact on the standards depends on the

software upgrade case.

Table 2   Software Upgrade Cases

| Software Upgrade Case                             | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node software upgrade with radio software upgrade | Affects all standards, the RAN Compute software, and the radio                                     software. If the radio is shared, the standards in the other ME                                     are also affected. |
| Software upgrade with system adaptive restart     | Can trigger radio software upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

At a node software upgrade, a check is done to compare the radio software specified

in the upgrade package with the software running on the radio. The latest radio

software that is compatible with the rest of the node software is selected to run on

the radio. If the selected software is newer than the running software, it is

replaced and the radio is restarted. This restart causes traffic disturbances in the

other ME. If the software running on the radio unit is not replaced during the

upgrade, the traffic in the other ME is unaffected.

Summary

This feature provides the possibility to add an additional RAT without the need to

install additional Baseband hardware. This feature also allows efficient use of the

Baseband hardware for sites with medium requirements on Baseband capacity. This

feature allows flexible multi-standard configuration, adding or replacing standards

for the desired combination, even without site visits. Efficient use of RAN Compute

hardware for sites with medium requirements on RAN Compute capacity.

Both FDD and TDD for LTE and NR are supported.

Hardware reconfiguration is not required to divide the physical resources, as the

Baseband Radio Node detects which sector carriers or TRXs are configured in the

system, and configures itself accordingly.

Limitations

- Mixed Mode Baseband is supported for RAN Compute units in Baseband Radio Nodes. For information on which combinations are supported for each RAN Compute type, consult Radio Node Configurations.
- Radio topologies that are supported in single mode are also supported when Mixed Mode Baseband is activated. However, radio interconnect (CPRI and eCPRI) dimensioning must be considered.
- Since the capacity of each standard in mixed mode is lower than the capacity of one standard in single mode, the target configuration must be designed within the limits supported by the hardware, see the Configuration and Capacity Checklist.
- If two LTE capacity modules are configured for the same eNodeB, the following limitations apply: Available throughput HWACs are distributed equally between the LTE capacity modules. If the node-level throughput HWAC capacity is less than the maximum throughput supported by the LTE capacity modules, the maximum throughput capacity of one of the capacity modules cannot be reached. The downlink and uplink PRB capacity provided by the installed capacity licenses is distributed equally between the LTE capacity modules. If the available downlink or uplink PRB capacity is less than two times the maximum number of downlink or uplink PRBs supported by the LTE capacity modules, the maximum downlink or uplink PRB capacity of one of the capacity modules cannot be reached.

### 3.1.3 Feature Operation of Mixed Mode Baseband

Different Mixed Mode Baseband configurations are possible with the addition of Mixed

Mode Radio and Mixed Mode Baseband R.

The Mixed Mode Baseband feature can run on its own or together with Mixed Mode Radio,

supporting up to five standards.

Mixed Mode Baseband Configurations

In mixed-mode configurations, the RAN Compute unit and the transport network

connection are shared between multiple standards. The Mixed Mode Baseband feature

also allows operation with the Mixed Mode Radio feature within the same Baseband

Radio Node. The following types of mixed mode configurations are supported:

- Dual mode
- Triple mode
- Quad mode
- Penta mode

For details on configurations supported with Mixed Mode Baseband, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Figure 6   Mixed Mode Baseband with Single Mode Radio

For details on supported configurations with NR, see Mixed Mode Baseband Scenarios with NR.

Mixed Mode Baseband with Mixed Mode Radio

In mixed-mode configuration, the following network elements are shared between

multiple standards:

- The fronthaul links between the radio units and RAN Compute units
- The radio unit
- The RAN Compute unit
- The transport network connection

Figure 7   Mixed Mode Baseband with Mixed Mode Radio

Mixed Mode Baseband with Baseband R

The Mixed Mode Baseband feature can be used in combination with Baseband R and a mix

of radio units running in mixed mode and in single mode. In this configuration,

Baseband R is shared between the different standards. Some fronthaul links are also

shared with Baseband R, while other radio units run in single mode.

Figure 8   Baseband R Used for Multiplexing

Mixed Mode Baseband with Radio Unit Cascading

The Mixed Mode Baseband feature supports radio unit cascading. Radio units in mixed

mode and in single mode can be ordered arbitrarily within the cascade chain.

## 3.2 Configure Mixed Mode Baseband

Follow the recommended preparation, installation and integration steps to introduce a

Mixed Mode Baseband configuration.

Figure 10 shows a high-level flow for configuring

Mixed Mode Baseband. Grey boxes indicate either conditional steps, or steps valid for

the flow, but described in separate documents.

Figure 10   Mixed Mode Baseband Configuration Flow

As a recommended part of the preparation phase, first consult the Configuration and Capacity Checklist.

Next, select the applicable configuration scenario:

- Mixed Mode Baseband Scenarios with NR
- Mixed Mode Baseband Scenarios LTE + WCDMA + GSM

### 3.2.1 Configuration and Capacity Checklist

Calculating required RAN Compute, radio and interconnect capacity and ensuring the

target configuration is supported is a prerequisite for a successful introduction or

reconfiguration of Mixed Mode Baseband.

Regardless of the use case for introducing Mixed Mode Baseband, whether it is the

introduction of new spectrum, densifying existing networks, migrating or sharing

existing spectrum, or modernizing the site, capacity and configuration planning is a

mandatory preparation activity. Figure 11 shows

an overview of the analysis and decision points needed.

Figure 11   Mixed Mode Baseband Design Flow

Table 4 includes example parameters to be

considered before expanding to Mixed Mode Baseband. The list is not meant to be

comprehensive, but to provide an overview supporting the reader in analyzing the

requirements for Mixed Mode Baseband. The order in the checklist presents a typical

example, but may vary depending on the scenario. Note that some of the checks might be

| General                     | What is the target Mixed Mode Baseband configuration?  Which standards are to be configured? For example, is it pure LTE +                                 NR? Does it include ESS or M-IoT?                                                                                                                                      |

| General                     | Does it have any dependencies or impact in existing                                 configurations?  Are there any feature restrictions?                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Radio                       | Are the existing radios already prepared for the new spectrum?

| Radio                       | If not, decide which new radios to install. Also consider whether the                                 existing radios could to replaced (possibly with multiband radios),                                 or whether to add new radios next to the existing ones.                                                                 |

#### 3.2.2.1 Preparation

Preparation activities cover the analysis of feature dependencies and impact, the

required configuration design and capacity calculation, and the ordering and installation of

HW and SW in time for the main integration task.

##### 3.2.2.1.1 Impact

Examples of how the feature activation affects certain aspects of the network

performance and operation.

The exact impact of

Mixed Mode Baseband introduction depends on the existing configuration and the activated

features. The following areas can be affected:

Capacity

The number of supported sector carriers, TRXs, and RI ports is reduced when a

single-mode RAN Compute unit is upgraded to Mixed Mode Baseband, as now the

resources are shared between the standards. For specific data on the maximum number

of supported sector carriers, TRXs, and RI ports in an NR-capable radio unit, refer

toRadio Node Configurations for Multistandard and Single Standard

Mixed Mode and DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

If the required number of supported sector carriers, TRXs, or the RI ports of the

single-mode RAN Compute is higher than the one possible in the Mixed Mode Baseband

configuration, consider the following solutions before the feature introduction:

- To address the challenge of reduced number of sector carriers, TRXs, and RI ports: Plan HW modernization: add a new RAN Compute unit or replace existing with a more capable unit Reparent radio units to another RAN Compute unit over CPRI
- Additionally, for the reduced number of RI ports: Expand the number of RI ports by using Baseband R503 Cascade radio units, see The exact impact of Mixed Mode Baseband introduction depends onRadio Cascade Configuration Rules

Performance

If

the Mixed Mode Baseband feature is activated,

Baseband

capacity can

decrease for each standard compared to single

mode

after a restart. If power saving mode is disabled to fit

other

standards,

power consumption increases. However, overall performance is improved

because

of a more efficient radio node management through a single

managed

element

and more economical use of

hardware.

Transport Network

The introduction of Mixed Mode Baseband

might

impact various configuration aspects of the transport network, such as routing, IP

addressing, or

the

traffic flows. For details, see

Manage Transport Network and

IP Network Connectivity for NR+LTE.

Synchronization

An NR system requires time synchronization in addition to frequency synchronization.

If only frequency synchronization is implemented for the site, then a

synchronization method for time needs to be planned as well. For details, see Synchronization for NR + LTE.

Other Impact

For details on the impact of ESS introduction, see

Ericsson Spectrum Sharing All-In-One User Guide.

##### 3.2.2.1.2 Requirements

A list of initial requirements for the introduction of Mixed Mode

Baseband.

Table 5   LTE+NR

Requirements

Table 6   NR with Other Standard Requirements

##### 3.2.2.1.3 IP Network Connectivity for NR+LTE

Mixed Mode Baseband with NR requires a special IP network design for the internal and

external traffic flow, through separated or shared VRs in a trusted or untrusted transport

network.

In NR EN-DC networks with LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband, the following kinds of X2 EN-DC

traffic flows exist:

- Internal X2 EN-DC traffic: between the LTE entity and the NR entity inside the same LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband Radio Node. Such traffic only exists when the LTE anchor carrier co-exists with its associated NR carrier in the LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband Radio Node.
- External X2 EN-DC traffic: between the NR entity of the LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband and the LTE anchor Baseband Radio Node, or between the LTE entity of the LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband and the NR Baseband Radio Node. Such traffic exists as long as the MCG resource of the EN-DC connection is from a different Baseband Radio Node than the SCG resource carried by the NR carrier.

Figure 19 shows an overview of the traffic flows

for Mixed Mode Baseband with NR SA and EN-DC.

Figure 19   Example Mixed Mode Baseband Traffic Flow

Mixed Mode Baseband Virtual Routers

The Virtual Router (VR) setup for LTE and NR RAN IP addresses in the LTE+NR Mixed

Mode Baseband Radio Node has impact on the configuration of the transport network

during an NR deployment and can be based on either a shared VR or separated VRs. A

shared VR handles both LTE and NR traffic, whereas in the case of separated VRs LTE

traffic is handled by one VR and NR traffic is handled by another VR.

If the transport network is trusted, the most obvious difference in a shared VR or

separated VR setup is the number of VLANs connecting to the TN router. For further

details see Manage Transport Network.

In the case of an untrusted transport network, the VR configuration for the outer and

inner network differs. The outer network is the untrusted network that provides the

transport to and from the LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband Radio Node. The inner network

is the trusted network and carries, for example, LTE and NR user plane, control

plane and O&amp;M traffic. The transport of the inner traffic over the outer network

is done through an IPsec VPN connection. For further details, see Manage IPSec.

More detailed VR configuration depends on the assumed network solution, see also

NR NSA Connectivity Guideline with Option 3x, NR RAN Transport Security Guideline, NR SA Connectivity Guideline with Option 2, and ESS Solution Guideline.

IP Version

Either IPv4 or IPv6 or both can be supported by the LTE+NR Mixed Mode Baseband Radio

Node. For example, LTE traffic can be on IPv4 and NR traffic on IPv6 in a trusted

and untrusted backhaul environment.

For more generic concepts or logical designs about IP addressing, routing, IPsec, and

SEG-related information, see NR NSA Connectivity Guideline with Option 3x, NR RAN Transport Security Guideline, NR SA Connectivity Guideline with Option 2, ESS Solution Guideline, Manage Transport Network, and Manage IPSec.

##### 3.2.2.1.4 Synchronization for NR + LTE

In synchronization methods for Mixed Mode, the requirements of the radio network timing

accuracy are higher than required by TDD radio standards.

For information and configuration instructions on all synchronization methods, see the

following documents:

- Manage Network Synchronization
- Network Synchronization Guidelines

As Mixed Mode Baseband allows more than one radio network to operate on the same RAN

Compute hardware, the following synchronization aspects apply to the radio networks,

regarding frequency synchronization:

- NR FDD and TDD require time synchronization.
- LTE FDD might require time synchronization, but the accuracy depends on the accuracy requirements of the activated features.
- LTE TDD always requires time synchronization.

Synchronization Aspects of LTE and NR on the Same RAN Compute Unit

As NR and LTE require time synchronization, the synchronization function must transit

from state TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED to state

RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED to satisfy LTE and NR accuracy requirements.

During the transition, the cells are disabled and the radio equipment clock makes a

phase jump to acquire the correct radio network time. For the radio node that uses

Mixed Mode Baseband, a phase jump can be requested by any radio network application

operating on the baseband.

In LTE, the transition to state RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED is controlled by

setting the attribute ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment

to true. Using this attribute is recommended for system

availability.

In a Mixed Mode Baseband configuration with LTE and NR, configuring the

ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment attribute has no

effect on the clock state transition. NR always requests the state transition to

RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED, so all cells get disabled during the

transition.

##### 3.2.2.1.5 IP Network Connectivity for NR with other standard

For detailed information on IP traffic and  network resilience and observability, see

Manage Transport Network.

Mixed Mode Baseband with NR and LTE requires a special IP network design for the internal

and external traffic flow, through separated or shared VRs in a trusted or untrusted

transport network. For details, see IP Network Connectivity for NR+LTE.

#### 3.2.2.3 Integration

The integration phase covers activities required to add a standard to a Mixed Mode

Baseband configuration.

##### 3.2.2.3.1 Reconfigure Cells or TRXs

If downsizing existing cells or TRXs is the method selected to ensure sufficient

capacity for Mixed Mode Baseband, reconfigure the cells or TRXs before adding a

standard.

This task can be omitted if other methods for ensuring capacity, such as HW

expansion, are used.

Steps

1. Check the following cell MOs: Table 7 Standard Sector MO Cell or TRX MO NR NRSectorCarrier NRCellDU NRCellCU LTE SectorCarrier NbIotCell EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD WCDMA NodeBSectorCarrier NodeBLocalCell GSM GsmSector Trx
2. If necessary, remove the appropriate number of sector carriers and corresponding cells or the TRXs to make the remaining ones fit in the RAN Compute unit together with the new cells or TRXs.

##### 3.2.2.3.2 Configure Transport Network

Set up shared or separated Virtual Routers for each standard in the Mixed Mode

Baseband configuration, and for each VR create and configure a Router

MO.

Steps

1. Create the required number of Router MOs, each representing a single VR.
2. Proceed with further Router configuration. For the detailed instructions on each VR configuration variant, see Manage IPSec and Manage Transport Network. A more detailed transport configuration depends on the assumed network solution, see NR NSA Connectivity Guideline with Option 3x, NR RAN Transport Security Guideline, NR SA Connectivity Guideline with Option 2, and ESS Solution Guideline.

##### 3.2.2.3.3 Activate Mixed Mode Baseband

The feature requires activation for

LTE, WCDMA, or

GSM. For NR, this is a basic feature, so no manual activation is

required.

Prerequisites

- All the preparation activities are performed.
- The license key is installed on the node.
- Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) is activated for at least one week before activation to collect troubleshooting data. Tip: Keep the CCTR active for a week following the activation as well.
![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState attribute to ACTIVATED for the required CXC instance of each standard. Table 8 Feature Activation Data for LTE, WCDMA, and GSM Standard MO Instance LTE FeatureState=CXC4012015 WCDMA FeatureState=CXC4012016 GSM FeatureState=CXC4012017

##### 3.2.2.3.4 Add a Standard to Mixed Mode Baseband

To add a standard to a mixed mode Baseband Radio Node, configure the MOs and

transport network additions for the standard, and restart the node.

Prerequisites

- All the preparation activities are performed
- The transport network additions are configured.
- The node is operational with all NR, LTE, WCDMA cells, and GSM TRXs and the Mixed Mode Baseband feature is activated.
- ENM is available.
- A planned area configuration for the new standard is created in ENM.

Steps

1. Create and configure MOs for the applicable standard: Standard Managed Object NR Always, GNBDUFunction and underlying MOs, particularly NRCellDU and NRSectorCarrier If applicable, GNBCUCPFunction and underlying MOs, particularly NRCellCU If applicable, GNBCUUPFunction and underlying MOs LTE ENodeBFunction SectorCarrier EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD NbIotCell WCDMA NodeBFunction NodeBLocalCellGroup according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBLocalCell according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBSectorCarrier according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBFunction according to the planned area for WCDMA NBAP Bearer MOs and other necessary MOs under NodeBFunction GSM BtsFunction GsmSector according to the planned area for GSM Trx according to the planned area for GSM AbisIp For more information, see Manage Radio Network for the appropriate standard and Manage GSM Abis Transport. Note: When an NRSectorCarrier MO is created for the first time, the node automatically restarts if the EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState, EUtranCellTDD.administrativeState, NbIotCell.administrativeState, or NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute changes, or when the NRSectorCarrier.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.If the EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState or EUtranCellTDD.administrativeState attribute is set to ENABLED at any time after startup, the automatic restart is not performed. When an NRSectorCarrier MO is created for the first time, the node automatically restarts if the NodeBLocalCellFDD.administrativeState, NodeBLocalCellTDD.administrativeState, NodeBLocalCell.administrativeState, or NodeBSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute changes, or when the NodeBSectorCarrier.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED.If the NodeBLocalCellFDD.administrativeState or NodeBLocalCelllTDD.administrativeState attribute is set to ENABLED at any time after startup, the automatic restart is not performed. When an NRSectorCarrier MO is created for the first time, the node automatically restarts if the TRX.administrativeState attribute changes, or when the TRX.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED. If the TRX.administrativeState attribute is set to ENABLED at any time after startup, the automatic restart is not performed.
2. Configure the additions of the new standard to the transport network, such as additional IP addresses or VLANs. For more information, see Manage Transport Network, Manage IPsec, Manage GSM Abis Transport, and Manage Radio Network.

If the new standard is WCDMA, do Step 3, else go to

Step 4:

3. Configure the Iub link to the RNC if required. The RNC automatically distributes Iub links among modules with an algorithm to achieve a balanced node. If a customized Iub link allocation is preferred, follow the instructions in Allocate Iub Links.
4. Unlock MOs for the appropriate standard: Option Description NR NRCellDU and NRSectorCarrier MOs LTE EUtranCellFDD, EUtranCellTDD, and NbIotCell WCDMA NodeBLocalCellGroup and all NodeBLocalCell MOs GSM All AbisIp and Trx MOs
5. Restart the radio node with restartRank RESTART\_WARM. Tip: It is recommended to initiate a restart at this precise moment of the procedure. Otherwise, a spontaneous restart can trigger the reconfiguration of the radio node. Troubleshooting: If the capacity prerequisites are not met, the Resource Allocation Failure alarm can be expected in case of insufficient resources, resulting in failure to activate one or more cells in the existing or the new standard. See the Resource Allocation Failure alarm instructions.

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)
8. Wait 15 minutes to ensure that all cells, local cells, and TRXs are operational and no further alarms are raised.

### 3.2.3 Mixed Mode Baseband Scenarios LTE + WCDMA + GSM

For LTE, WCDMA and GSM, any combination of the three standards is possible, forming

either a dual or triple standard Mixed Mode Baseband configuration.

#### 3.2.3.1 Preparation

Preparation activities cover the analysis of feature dependencies and impact, the

required configuration design and capacity calculation, and the ordering and installation of

HW and SW in time for the main integration task.

##### 3.2.3.1.1 Impact

Examples of how the feature activation affects certain aspects of the network

performance and operation.

The exact impact of Mixed Mode Baseband introduction depends on the existing

configuration and the activated features. The following areas can be affected:

Capacity

The number of supported sector carriers and TRXs is reduced when a single-mode RAN

Compute unit is upgraded to a mixed mode configuration, as now the resources are

shared between the RATs. For details, see Radio Node Configurations for Multistandard and Single Standard

Mixed Mode and DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

If the required number of supported sector carriers or TRXs of the single-mode RAN

Compute is higher than the one possible in the Mixed Mode Baseband configuration,

consider the following solutions before the feature introduction:

- Plan HW modernization: add a new RAN Compute unit or replace existing with a more capable unit
- Reparent radio units to another RAN Compute unit over CPRI
- Cascade radios, see Radio Cascade Configuration Rules

Performance

If power saving mode is disabled to fit another standard, power consumption

increases. However, overall performance is improved thanks to a more efficient radio

node management through a single ME and more economical use of HW.

Transport Network

The introduction of Mixed Mode Baseband may impact various configuration aspects of

the transport network, such as routing, IP addressing, or traffic flows. For

details, see Manage Transport Network.

Synchronization

Synchronization requirements vary for different standards. For details, see Synchronization for LTE + WCDMA + GSM.

##### 3.2.3.1.2 Requirements

A list of initial requirements for the introduction of Mixed Mode Baseband for LTE,

WCDMA, and GSM.

Hardware

RAN Compute unit is deployed:

- Note: If a new RAN Compute unit is required to meet the required capacity needs, follow the procedures covered in Integrate Baseband Radio Node.
- Baseband R503 if enhancing the CPRI port density is required.

Because of additional sectors or frequency bands, or for radio capacity reasons,

supporting HW is installed and configured:

- Additional radio units and other supporting equipment, such as antennas, and antenna near units, together with corresponding Baseband R units, and power units. For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.
- Re-cabling can also be necessary to address the decreased number of RI ports.

Use the Configuration and Capacity Checklist to plan the target configuration.

Software

The software running on the node must support the target configuration. If it does

not, it must be upgraded before attempting to add a standard. The minimum SW version

for the three standards is 16B, although for GSM a newer version is recommended. For

details, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

- Mixed Mode Baseband: LTE: FAJ 121 4565 WCDMA: FAJ 121 4566 GSM: FAJ 121 4567

##### 3.2.3.1.3 Synchronization for LTE + WCDMA + GSM

In synchronization methods for Mixed Mode, the requirements of the radio network timing

accuracy are higher than required by TDD radio standards.

For information and configuration instructions on all synchronization methods, see the

following documents:

- Manage Network Synchronization
- Network Synchronization Guidelines

As Mixed Mode Baseband allows more than one radio network to operate on the same RAN

Compute hardware, the following synchronization aspects apply to the radio networks,

regarding frequency synchronization:

- LTE FDD might require time synchronization, but the accuracy depends on the accuracy requirements of the activated features.
- LTE TDD always requires time synchronization.
- WCDMA does not require time synchronization.
- GSM might require time synchronization, but it is sufficient if the synchronization function reaches the TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED state.

#### 3.2.3.2 Installation

In this document, installation activities are narrowed down to installing feature

licenses. The installation of hardware, capacity licenses, HWACs, and prerequisite feature

licenses is part of the workflow, but not presented here.

For information on hardware installation procedures, see the installation document of the

relevant hardware unit. For information on capacity licenses and HWACs installation, see

Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.

successfully installed on the nodes.

#### 3.2.3.3 Integration

The integration phase covers activities required to add a standard to a Mixed Mode

Baseband configuration.

##### 3.2.3.3.1 Reconfigure Cells and TRXs

If downsizing existing cells and TRXs is the method selected to ensure sufficient

capacity for Mixed Mode Baseband, reconfigure the cells before adding another

standard.

This task can be omitted if other methods for ensuring capacity, such as HW

expansion, are used.

Steps

1. Check the following cell MOs: EUtranCellFDD, EutranCellTDD, NbIotCell, NodeBLocalCell, and Trx.
2. If necessary, remove the appropriate number of cells and TRXs to make the remaining ones fit in the RAN Compute unit together with the cells and TRXs of the new standard.

##### 3.2.3.3.2 Activate Mixed Mode Baseband for LTE, WCDMA, and GSM

The feature requires activation for LTE, WCDMA, and GSM.

Activating the feature for LTE, WCDMA and GSM requires that the corresponding

licenses valid for all the standards in the Mixed Mode combination are installed.

Otherwise, all the cells and TRXs are disabled.

Table 9   Feature Activation Data for LTE, WCDMA, and GSM

| Standard   | MO Instance             |
|------------|-------------------------|
| LTE        | FeatureState=CXC4012015 |
| WCDMA      | FeatureState=CXC4012016 |
| GSM        | FeatureState=CXC4012017 |

Prerequisites

- All the preparation activities are performed.
- The license key is installed on the node.
- Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) is activated for at least one week before activation to collect troubleshooting data. Tip: Keep the CCTR active for a week following the activation as well.
![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED for the required CXC instance of each standard.

##### 3.2.3.3.3 Add LTE, WCDMA, or GSM to Baseband Radio Node

To add a new standard to a Baseband Radio Node that already has a multistandard

configuration, configure the new standard MOs and transport network additions, and restart

the node.

Prerequisites

- All the preparation activities are performed.
- The node is operational and the Mixed Mode Baseband feature is activated on the applicable standards.
- A planned area configuration for the new standards is created in ENM.
- ENM is available.

Steps

1. Create the following MOs for the applicable standard. Standard Managed Object LTE ENodeBFunction SectorCarrier EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD NbIotCell WCDMA NodeBLocalCellGroup according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBLocalCell according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBSectorCarrier according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBFunction according to the planned area for WCDMA NBAP Bearer MOs and other necessary MOs under NodeBFunction GSM BtsFunction GsmSector according to the planned area for GSM Trx according to the planned area for GSM AbisIp For more information, see Manage Radio Network for the appropriate standard and Manage GSM Abis Transport.
2. Configure the additions of the new standard to the transport network, such as additional IP addresses or VLANs. For more information, see Manage Transport Network, Manage IPsec, Manage GSM Abis Transport, and Manage Radio Network.

If the new standard is WCDMA, do the following:

3. Configure the Iub link to the RNC if required. The RNC automatically distributes Iub links among modules with an algorithm to achieve a balanced node. If a customized Iub link allocation is preferred, follow the instructions in Allocate Iub Links.
4. Unlock MOs for the appropriate standard: Option Description LTE EUtranCellFDD, EUtranCellTDD, and NbIotCell WCDMA NodeBLocalCellGroup and all NodeBLocalCell MOs GSM All AbisIp and Trx MOs
5. Restart the radio node with restartRank RESTART\_WARM. Tip: It is recommended to initiate a restart at this precise moment of the procedure. Otherwise, a spontaneous restart can trigger the reconfiguration of the radio node. Troubleshooting: If the capacity prerequisites are not met, then the Resource Allocation Failure alarm can be expected in case of insufficient resources, resulting in failure to activate one or more cells in the existing or the new standard. See the Resource Allocation Failure alarm instructions.

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)
8. Wait 15 minutes to ensure that all cells, local cells, and TRXs are operational and no alarms are raised.

##### 3.2.3.3.4 Allocate RF Ports for Mixed Mode Above Two Standards

If a radio unit used in the mixed mode configuration does not support more than two

standards for each RF port, the cells and TRXs need to be explicitly mapped to RF

branches.

Depending to the type of radio and frequency band, there are limitations with regards

to the number of the standards that are supported on the same RF port and on the

same band. To check how many and which standards are possible for a given radio

unit, consult Supported Radio Capabilities.

To map cells and TRXs to RF branches, do as follows:

Prerequisites

The FieldReplaceableUnit MO and an appropriate number of

RfBranch MO instances are created.

Steps

1. Lock all cells and TRXs for the FieldReplaceableUnit MO allocated to a radio with triple standard mixed mode.
2. Set the value of attribute rfBranchTxRef to refer to an RfBranch MO in such a way that only the wanted standards refer to the same RfBranch MO. The rfBranchTxRef is found under LTE: SectorCarrier WCDMA: NodeBSectorCarrier GSM: Trx
3. Unlock all cells and TRXs for each FieldReplaceableUnit allocated to a radio with triple standard mixed mode.

### 3.2.4 Optimize Mixed Mode Baseband Configuration

After a successful integration of the radio node with Mixed Mode Baseband configuration,

optimization activities may be required to secure optimal network operation. These

activities may include, for example, the optimization of cell relations, mobility

functions, and use of radio resources.

## 3.3 Reconfigure Mixed Mode Baseband

When wishing to reconfigure or decommission Mixed Mode Baseband, for example when

changing back to single mode or removing a standard to make space for a new one, deactivate

the feature and remove the configuration.

Follow-up activities usually include enabling Baseband Power Savings or removing unused

hardware to free up space and reduce power consumption.

### 3.3.1 Deactivate Mixed Mode Baseband

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR) is activated for at least one week before

activation to collect troubleshooting data.

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED for the required CXC instance of each standard: Option Description LTE FeatureState=CXC4012015 WCDMA FeatureState=CXC4012016 GSM FeatureState=CXC4012017

### 3.3.2 Remove Standard from Mixed Mode Baseband

Remove a standard from a Baseband Radio Node to free up capacity for a new standard,

or to decommission it completely.

To remove a standard running on a Baseband Radio Node, whether in a single mode or

mixed mode, delete the standard MOs. Hardware that is no longer necessary after the

removal of the standard can be removed as well.

Prerequisites

- ENM is available.
- The Mixed Mode Baseband feature is deactivated.

Steps

If WCDMA is removed, start with Step 1. Otherwise, start with Step 2.

1. Lock the UtranCell MO in the RNC.
2. Lock the following MOs for the applicable standard: Option Description NR NRCellDU and NRSectorCarrier LTE EUtranCellFDD, EUtranCellTDD, and NbIotCell WCDMA IubLink, NodeBLocalCellGroup, NodeBLocalCell GSM AbisIp and Trx
3. Delete the additions of the new standard to the transport network configured for the standard that is removed.
4. Delete the following MOs for the applicable standard. Option Description NR GNBDUFunction NRCellDU NRSectorCarrier GNBCUCPFunction NRCellCU GNBCUUPFunction LTE SectorCarrier EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD NbIotCell ENodeBFunction Note: The ENodeBFunction MO must be deleted after all cells are deleted. WCDMA NodeBFunction GSM BtsFunction Result: The ENodeBFunction MO deletion triggers a node warm restart automatically. After the restart, LTE goes into the dormant state.

After the MO deletion of NR, WCDMA, or GSM, do the following:

5. Execute the action FieldReplaceableUnit.restartUnit with restartRank RESTART\_WARM. Tip: Restarting the node can be postponed until an appropriate time to prevent disturbing the traffic on the remaining standards.
![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

## 3.4 Monitor Mixed Mode Baseband

### 3.4.1 Performance

This feature does not introduce dedicated KPIs, counters or events for performance

monitoring. For performance statistics, each standard can have its own ROP file, or a common ROP

file is used for all.

PM Statistics

The PmSupport.ropFileHandling parameter is used for selecting whether a

single PM statistics ROP file covering all standards is produced for each ROP, or if one ROP

file for each standard is produced in addition to common PM statistics. For more

information, see Manage Performance.

For Mixed Mode Baseband NR, the number of PM counter files can be configured for each ROP

on the Baseband Radio Node. The ENM supports only one file for each ROP.

General Observability

KPIs are collected for each standard separately. When comparing a Mixed Mode Baseband

configuration to a single-mode configuration, higher power consumption can be observed.

### 3.4.2 Faults

The automatic fault recovery function applies to Mixed Mode Baseband.

When the feature is activated, fault recovery can affect the crashed standard only or all

the standards, depending on the fault severity. With the intention to keep impact to

minimum, the fault recovery function targets the crashed standard in the first place.

The subsequent fault recoveries can affect all standards, especially when shared

resources or resources with hardware dependency coupling need to restart the complete

RAN Compute unit, with consequences for all the standards. In such a case, the following

events occur:

- Restart of the RAN Compute unit is escalated.
- Traffic is stopped in all standards.

Also faults in common, not standard-specific, parts of the RAN Compute unit can affect

all standards and issue secondary alarms. For more information on recovery escalation

cases in a Baseband Radio Node, see Manage Faults.

#### 3.4.2.1 Disabled Cells after MO Update

The Baseband unit needs to be restarted, if there is a Radio Gateway in the

configuration, and not all cells are enabled after any of the following MOs are updated

while the node runs:

- RiLink
- RiPort
- SectorEquipmentFunction

The related MO updates are the following:

- Deleting
- Creating
- Locking
- Unlocking

For more information on restarting the Baseband unit, see Restart Unit in Manage Hardware Equipment.

Summary

The main benefit of the Mixed Mode Radio feature is that radio units can be shared

between two nodes of the same or different radio standards. The Mixed Mode Radio

feature improves the flexibility of existing and new RBS installations. The costs

associated with running different radio standards in the same frequency band are

minimized.

Additional Information

Mixed Mode Radio combinations are maintained as a whole. This means that the software

and hardware used for Mixed Mode Radio must be compatible. Both the node software

level and the radio software level must match the radio unit in use. For specific

compatibility information, see the appropriate radio unit description, the release

notes for the relevant software version, and Radio Node Configurations.

For the summary of Mixed Mode Radio feature enhancements, see Feature Change History of Mixed Mode Radio.

For more information about this feature and related topics, see 3GPP TS 37.104,

NR, E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE; Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Station (BS)

### 4.2.3 Feature Operation of Mixed Mode Radio

The purpose of Mixed Mode Radio is to enable a configuration where a radio unit is

shared by more than one radio node, or by multiple standards from a single radio

node.

Mixed mode radio enables a maximum of four installed radio standards. For more information,

see Radio Node Configurations.

Figure 20, Figure 21, and Figure 22 show simplified configurations examples of

different standards. These figures do not show the connections to the core network and the

synchronization between the units. Macro or main remote configurations are supported as

well.

Figure 20   Example of Mixed Mode Radio with Single Mode Baseband

Figure 21   Examples of Mixed Mode Baseband with Mixed Mode Radio and Single Mode Radio

Figure 22   Examples of Mixed Mode Radio with Mixed Mode Baseband and Single Mode Baseband

#### 4.2.3.1 Radio Configuration Overview for Mixed Mode Radio

Each radio node in a mixed mode radio combination has a separate radio configuration.

This means that a shared radio has multiple configurations, one for each of the radio

nodes that share it. These configurations must be compatible with each other; if there

is incompatibility (such as overallocation of resources between nodes that share a

radio), an alarm is raised. Sectors for mixed mode radio are configured in all nodes by

selecting an RBB that supports shared radios. For all possible radio configurations, see

Radio Configurations for Multistandard and Single Standard Mixed

Mode.

Figure 23 shows an example configuration where both

nodes have three sectors, and where each sector has two shared mixed mode radio

units.

Figure 23   3×2 Radio + 3×2 Radio Configuration

Cascaded Radios

Mixed

Mode

Radio

can be used in combination with cascaded radios, using shared CPRI. Cascading radios

is an efficient way to reduce the number of CPRI cables and ports used on the RAN

Compute unit, especially for sites with low bandwidth or capacity. In the same

cascade chain, a maximum of six radio units and two RAN Compute units can be used.

One or more mixed mode radio units and one single mode radio can be connected in a

cascade chain. As a result, fronthaul equipment cost is reduced and configuration is

simplified.

Figure 24   Mixed Mode Radio Cascade Chain Examples

Cascading radios allows using radios in different ways for different radio standards,

by providing configuration flexibility in the following cases:

- Number of antenna branches
- RF bandwidth
- Power levels

It is also possible to use mixed types of radio equipment if these support the same

kind of CPRI. In this case, it is possible to use macro, macro AIR, and indoor IRU

with RDS in the same CPRI chain.

For more information, see Radio Cascade Configuration Rules.

Compatible TDD Patterns

In

Mixed

Mode

Radio

TDD configurations, only the use of compatible TDD patterns is allowed. Identical

TDD patterns are compatible.

Non-identical but compatible patterns can also be used on CPRI radios that support

mixed mode NR+LTE TDD. In this case, a compatibility check and an alignment

procedure are performed for the TDD switch points of all carriers sharing a radio

unit. Compatible TDD patterns allow for the simultaneous transition of all carriers

in the TDD radio from uplink to downlink symbols and from downlink to uplink

symbols. Non-identical patterns can damage the hardware and are rejected by the

system. If the patterns are incompatible, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised.

For configuring TDD patterns, see Configure TDD Patterns for LTE and NR Mixed Mode Radio.

##### 4.2.3.1.1 Radio Supporting Multiple Load Modules

Some radio types have separate software load modules for single mode configuration

and mixed mode configuration. In these rare cases, several requirements must be met to

support automatic switching between these modules.

Multiple load modules, including a single LTE load module and a load module for NR + LTE

mixed mode configuration, are contained in the upgrade package of a radio in single mode

configuration. Because of the existence of the multiple load modules, the radio can

switch automatically to mixed mode radio configuration based on the configuration from

the Baseband unit. Such multiple load modules are supported on the following radios:

- Radio 8818
- Radio 8808 B38A
- Radio 4412 B40 and Radio 4412 B41

For the supported configurations, see Radio Node Configurations.

To support switching between multiple load modules in the radio, the following

requirements must be met:

- Users must delete unused carriers, including a Baseband unit that is to be removed in mixed mode configuration.
- In the configuration where two Baseband units are connected to one radio, the software for both Baseband units must be upgraded. Table 12 Required Software Version for Radio Units Radio Unit Software Version Radio 8818 21.Q3 or later Radio 8808 B38A 23.Q1 or later Radio 4412 B40 and Radio 4412 B41 22.Q4.2 or later
- The radio must not share a sector with another radio.
- At most three LMCs are allowed within one radio.

required site and network design, and installing the feature licenses in time for the main

integration task.

The details of site and network design and the procedures for ordering products are out

of scope of this document.

#### 4.3.1.1 Impact of Mixed Mode Radio

Activating the Mixed Mode Radio feature affects certain aspects of the network

performance and operation.

Coverage

The coverage of cells using shared radio units is affected in the following ways:

- The maximum output power for each standard might be limited because the radio unit power is shared between the standards. The coverage in uplink might be affected because of intermodulation, and it is recommended to consider this during network planning.
- A shared antenna system might affect coverage because the antenna tilt or azimuth is not optimal for all standards.

Downtime

Mixed Mode Radio might increase the number of cell restarts if there are two nodes

that can cause radio unit restarts. This increases the total downtime of cells.

If the combination of mixed mode radio and mixed mode Baseband is handled by one node

instead of multiple nodes, the radio unit restart number is reduced. As a result,

the downtime is reduced as well.

#### 4.3.1.2 Requirements of Mixed Mode Radio

Initial requirements for the introduction of mixed mode radio.

Hardware Requirements

- For a complete list of supported hardware configurations for each standard combinations, see Radio Node Configurations.
- The required output power capacities are installed. An HWAC is required if output is to be above 20 W for each radio unit. For details, see Output Power for details.
- For cabling and connections, see Antenna and RF Connections and Non-RF Connections.
- All carriers for the configured standards need to be configured within the radio unit supported bandwidth span. For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.

Data Port Connection Requirements

CPRI or eCPRI connections on a shared unit must be separated for each radio node

according to the following criteria: the CPRI or eCPRI cable from a Baseband Radio

Node can be connected to any of the RiPort DATA ports on the

radio unit.

Some RAN Compute units and some radio units support either CPRI or eCPRI, but not

both simultaneously. Other RAN Compute units support both CPRI and eCPRI at the same

time for LTE and NR. For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.

Software Requirements

The software must be compatible across all shared equipment. For more information,

see Software Management for Shared

Equipment.

Feature License Requirements

Table 13   Mixed Mode Radio Feature License Requirements

| Feature Name                | FAJ Number   |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Mixed Mode Radio LTE        | FAJ 121 0906 |
| Mixed Mode Radio WCDMA      | FAJ 121 1553 |
| Mixed Mode GSM for Baseband | FAJ 121 4586 |

Network and Configuration Requirements

- The radio unit must support all configured standards.
- Resource planning must be done for nodes, or standards, or both in such a way that no more than 100% of available resources is allocated to the shared equipment. If shared equipment requires more than 100% of available resources, it is possible that hardware upgrade or hardware expansion is necessary.
- The sum of the power allocated by radio nodes and standards must not exceed the maximum power level of the radio unit.
- The maximum allowed difference in configured output power between any carriers is 6 dB.
- The sum of carriers configured by radio nodes and for all standards must not exceed the maximum number of carriers for the radio unit.
- The sum of carriers configured by radio nodes must not exceed the maximum number of transmit carriers for RF port of the radio unit. Different RF ports can be configured for different standards.
- In configurations without shared spectrum, all carrier frequencies in the same RBB must be configured so that they do not overlap in the downlink frequency.
- In configurations with shared spectrum, the carrier frequencies can overlap.
- In a Baseband Radio Node that runs more than one radio standard on a radio unit through a shared CPRI, the CPRI bandwidth must not be exceeded.
- Whenever a Baseband Radio Node is included in a mixed mode solution with CPRI shared equipment, Node Group Synchronization must be used.
- For GSM, IBW needs to be considered. For more information, see Manage Radio Network for GSM.

For more information on the configuration requirements, see Radio Node Configurations.

##### 4.3.1.2.2 Output Power

Output power must be configured as part of the preparation activities for mixed mode

radio.

Maximum output power is allocated statically for each radio standard for each TRX or

sector carrier in the respective node configuration.

If an additional carrier is configured, the radio might need to retune the transmitter.

As a result, an interruption occurs on the already configured carrier. The power is set

for each sector carrier or TRX. Different power levels can be used for different sector

carriers or TRXs.

The maximum configurable output power for a radio and radio node is limited by the

maximum output power of the radio and the power configuration set for the sector carrier

for the radio standard. The radio rejects power configuration requests if the total

requested power exceeds the radio hardware limitation.

In addition, HWACs are required for GSM, WCDMA, LTE, and NR for each radio standard or

for each node to configure more than 20 W. For more information, see Hardware-Related Capabilities.

When changing output power or bandwidth in a radio for any sector carrier or TRX, short

interrupts might occur on the already activated carriers in the radio. It can also occur

in the startup phase until all sector carriers and TRXs are started for all standards

and nodes. Locking or unlocking a carrier can cause short interrupts for other unlocked

carriers in the radio.

When sharing a radio, the maximum allowed difference in configured output power between

any carriers is 6 dB.

For further information, see Radio Node Configurations.

GSM Power Overbooking

To enable power overbooking for GSM mixed mode radio configurations, the GSM MCPA

Intelligent Power Management Baseband feature must be activated. For each TRX using

power overbooking, use Trx.configuredMaxTxPower to set the power

allocated to GSM with a granularity of 1 mW, and

Trx.reservedMaxTxPower to set how much power is reserved for

the TRX in the MCPA.

Power overbooking might require dynamic reduction of the output power, so-called

backoffs, in short time periods. It is recommended to activate power efficiency

features mentioned in MCPA Guideline.

#### 4.3.1.3 Synchronization in Mixed Mode

For

Managed

Elements that share resources, the nodes must be synchronized with

each other.

The selection

of

synchronization method depends on the type of fronthaul used.

Different methods are supported for

CPRI-connected

shared units and

eCPRI-connected

shared units.

For

CPRI-connected

shared units, Node Group Synchronization must be used.

This

method is described in Manage Node Group Synchronization.

For

eCPRI-connected

units, the following different methods are supported:

- GNSS to both nodes
- PTP from backhaul to both nodes
- PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit

The PTP fronthaul synchronization through the shared unit method has better robustness

in

case of GNSS or backhaul PTP synchronization faults than the other

methods.

##### 4.3.1.3.1 CPRI Shared Unit Synchronization

A configuration with CPRI shared equipment that contains a Baseband Radio Node must use Node

Group Synchronization.

Mixing mismatching synchronization methods within the node group is not supported. For

information and configuration instructions on all synchronization methods for mixed mode

radio, see Manage Node Group Synchronization and Network Synchronization Solution Guideline.

In Node Group Synchronization, nodes in the network are configured as node group members, and

only one external synchronization reference is used at a time to synchronize the node

group.

Synchronization over CPRI requires no additional cables, the existing CPRI connections

between the units are used for synchronization.

##### 4.3.1.3.2 eCPRI Shared Unit Synchronization

###### 4.3.1.3.2.1 Dual GNSS

With the Dual GNSS, the phase synchronization between the nodes is assured by time and

phase synchronizing both nodes to GNSS. For more information about time and phase

synchronization, see Manage Network Synchronization.

In deployments with shared eCPRI radio units, the delays of the GNSS system must be

compensated by configuring the attributes that represent these delays. For more details,

see GNSS Receiver System User Guide.

The radio unit automatically selects one of the RI ports to synchronize the internal

processing and AIR interface. In most cases, the AIR unit is able to switch between the

ports without disturbing traffic on the radio.

###### 4.3.1.3.2.2 Backhaul PTP Synchronization of Both Nodes

With the dual backhaul PTP method, the phase synchronization between two nodes is assured

by time-and-phase synchronizing both nodes to a common Cell Site Router (CSR), which

supports PTP directly connected to the Baseband units. The following solutions apply for

synchronization through CSR:

- The router takes time from backhaul using PTP.
- The router takes time from the GNSS connected to it or from PTP provided by a remote GM.

It is recommended to keep the differential accuracy between the ports at a minimum for

successful synchronization. To gain the best differential accuracy, position the common

Boundary Clock only one hop away on both legs. However, the

PtpBcOcPort.ptpPathTimeError attribute is set from the accuracy

delivered by the network from its GM.

###### 4.3.1.3.2.3 Fronthaul PTP Synchronization through the Shared Unit

PTP

fronthaul

time

synchronization

over eCPRI ports through the shared unit provides time alignment between two Baseband

units sharing

the

unit.

The

Baseband unit

with

a

more accurate time reference provides synchronization to the shared

unit. At the same time, the other Baseband unit uses the synchronization over eCPRI port

from the shared unit

for

time alignment.

Rules for Fronthaul PTP Synchronization

The following rules apply to

configurations

using fronthaul PTP synchronization over eCPRI ports:

- In deployments with multiple Managed Elements, time synchronization is mandatory. Baseband nodes must be synchronized with a time reference even if the shared unit is an eCPRI-based FDD radio unit.
- Baseband units with fronthaul PTP synchronization configured act as a group leader or as a group follower.
- Only one Baseband unit can act as the group leader.
- Each Baseband unit has a valid external time reference to avoid potential traffic loss, but only the time reference of the group leader is active.
- Up to 15 nodes that share radio unitsare supported by fronthaul PTP synchronization. The nodes are synchronized to each other through the shared radio units.
- Each node is assigned a unique FronthaulReference.nodePriority attribute value between 1 and 15. The lower value takes precedence.
- One radio unit can be shared between two nodes.
- The following conditions apply to the supported fronthaul PTP synchronization topology: Note: Fronthaul PTP Synchronization is a broad term, encompassing different methods for synchronization of eCPRI connected units: GNSS to both nodes PTP backhaul to both nodes Synchronization through shared eCPRI unit by using the FronthaulReferenceMO encapsulating the FronthaulBoundaryOrdinaryClock MO instance Nodes are synchronized through the shared radio unit. To minimize time error, place the Baseband unit with the lowest FronthaulReference.nodePriority attribute value in the middle. Fronthaul PTP synchronization might be supported with NGS expansion. Nodes can be cascaded. Up to two hops away from the node with the lowest FronthaulReference.nodePriority attribute value is supported. Note: Cascading radio units are not supported. Regarding supported fronthaul PTP synchronization topology with NGS expansion, see Use of Node Group Synchronization on Shared CPRI Units and Shared or Non-Shared eCPRI Units in Manage Node Group Synchronization.

#### 4.3.1.4 Configuration Planning for Mixed Mode Radio

Mixed mode radio and shared radio configuration require the planning of power,

bandwidth, use of RF ports, number of sector carriers, and TRXs.

The following general guidelines apply to all radio standards:

- The sum of the power allocated to the carriers or TRXs must not exceed the radio unit limitation. Note: When power overbooking is enabled for GSM, it is possible to configure higher output power in total for the sharing TRXs than what is supported.
- All carrier frequencies in the same RBB must be configured so that they do not exceed the downlink or uplink internal bandwidth limitation of the radio unit.
- CPRI bandwidth must be considered in all configurations. For mixed mode Baseband, CPRI capacity for sector carriers for all standards must be summed up and checked that it is sufficient.

Output Power

For NR, LTE, and WCDMA, the radio unit rejects the configuration request if the power

level supported by the radio unit capabilities is reached, an alarm is raised, and

the cell setup fails.

For GSM, the radio unit rejects the configuration request if maximum power level

supported by the radio unit capabilities is exceeded, and an alarm is raised. The

status of the Trx.abisTxState changes, and

Trx.Operational Condition changes to

Degraded in the BSC.

Number of Carriers

For NR, LTE and WCDMA, the radio unit rejects the configuration request if the number

of carriers supported by the radio unit capabilities is reached, an alarm is raised,

and the cell setup fails.

For GSM, the radio unit rejects the configuration request if the number of carriers

supported by the radio unit capabilities is reached, and an alarm is raised. The

Trx.operationalState and

Trx.availabilityState changes for the TRX, and

Trx.Operational Condition changes to Not

Operational in the BSC.

Bandwidth

For NR, LTE and WCDMA, the radio unit rejects the configuration request if the

selected carriers are outside the radio unit IBW, an alarm is raised, and the cell

setup fails.

For GSM, the radio unit rejects the configuration request if maximum power level

supported by the radio unit capabilities is reached, and an alarm is raised. The

Trx.operationalState and

Trx.availabilityState changes for the TRX, and

Trx.Operational Condition changes to Not

Operational in the BSC.

Other GSM Considerations

A GSM TRX in a Baseband Radio Node cannot be combined with a cell in another node. If

they are in the same node, the TRX and the cell can be combined.

Antenna

The nodes sharing a common antenna system must be configured so that maximum antenna

control and supervision is achieved. For more information on specific antenna

configurations, see Building Blocks and Manage Hardware Equipment.

#### 4.3.1.5 Configure Shared Radio Gateway

To configure the node with the shared Radio Gateway function for the first time:

Steps

1. Connect the Radio Gateway to one of the MEs. Leave the other ME disconnected or delete the link to it.
2. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute to true in the MO that represents the Radio Gateway.
3. Upgrade the ME to the release that supports multi-ME function.
4. Delete, then create the link to the Radio Gateway to enable the shared Radio Gateway function.
5. Upgrade the other ME to the release that supports multi-ME function.
6. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute to true in the MO that represents the Radio Gateway on the ME to be connected to the Radio Gateway.
7. Connect the ME to the Radio Gateway.

### 4.3.2 Installation

4. Select the imported LKF and define the details of the installation in the Install Key Files Job wizard. The job schedule can be set to a selected date, or to be executed immediately.

Results

Once the job status changes to COMPLETED and the job

result is SUCCESS, the LKFs are successfully installed

on the nodes.

### 4.3.3 Integration

#### 4.3.3.1 Activate Mixed Mode Radio

The feature requires activation for LTE, WCDMA, and GSM. For NR, Mixed Mode Radio is

a non-license-controlled feature, no manual activation is required.

Activating the feature for LTE, WCDMA, and GSM requires that the corresponding

licenses for all the standards in the mixed mode combination are installed.

Otherwise, all the standard cells and TRXs are disabled.

Prerequisites

- All the preparation activities are performed, see Preparations for Mixed Mode Radio.
- The license key is installed in the node. Table 18 Activation Data Standard License Control MO NR Non-license-controlled LTE FeatureState=CXC4011018 WCDMA FeatureState=CXC4020051 GSM FeatureState=CXC4012017
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to ACTIVATED for the appropriate license control MO instance of each standard.

#### 4.3.3.2 Add Standard to Mixed Mode Radio

To add a new standard to a configuration with one or more standards, configure the

standard-specific MOs and transport network additions. Restarting the node might be

required.

Prerequisites

- All the activities that ensure sufficient capacity are performed.
- The node is operational and the Mixed Mode Radio feature is activated on the applicable standards.
- A planned area configuration for the new standards is created in ENM.
- ENM is available.

Steps

1. Create or modify the necessary MOs for the relevant standard. Standard Managed Object NR ManagedElement: Must have a unique ID in NR+NR Mixed Mode Radio setup. GNBCUCPFunction GNBCUUPFunction GNBDUFunction NRCellCU NRCellDU NRSectorCarrier LTE ENodeBFunction SectorCarrier EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD NbIotCell (optional) WCDMA NodeBFunction NodeBLocalCellGroup according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBLocalCell according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBSectorCarrier according to the planned area for WCDMA NodeBFunction according to the planned area for WCDMA NBAP Bearer MOs and other necessary MOs under NodeBFunction GSM BtsFunction GsmSector according to the planned area for GSM Trx according to the planned area for GSM AbisIp ExtTrx for combined cell (optional) For more information, see Manage GSM Abis Transport. For more information, see Manage Radio Network for the appropriate standard.
2. Configure the additions of the new standard to the transport network, such as additional IP addresses or VLANs. For more information, see the following documents: Manage Transport Network Manage IPsec Manage GSM Abis Transport Manage Radio Network
3. Do one of the following steps, depending on the added standard: Standard Action NR Continue with Step 4. LTE Continue with Step 4. WCDMA Configure the Iub link to the RNC, if required. The RNC automatically distributes Iub links among modules with an algorithm to achieve a balanced node. If a customized Iub link allocation is preferred, follow the instructions in Allocate Iub Links. GSM Configure the Abis IP link to the BSC, if required.
4. Unlock the MO instances for the appropriate standard: NR NRCellDU and NRSectorCarrier LTE EUtranCellFDD, EUtranCellTDD, and NbIotCell WCDMA NodeBLocalCellGroup and all NodeBLocalCell GSM AbisIp and all Trx
5. Wait 15 minutes.
6. Verify that the cells, the TRXs, or both are enabled.

If the operationalState is not ENABLED or an

alarm is raised:

7. Restart the node with restartRank RESTART\_WARM. Tip: If restart is required, it is recommended to initiate the restart at this moment of the procedure. Otherwise, a spontaneous restart can trigger the reconfiguration of the node. Troubleshooting: If the capacity prerequisites are not met, then the Resource Allocation Failure alarm can be expected in case of insufficient resources. This results in failure to activate one or more cells in the existing or the new standard. See the Resource Allocation Failure document for instructions.

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)
10. Wait 15 minutes to ensure that all cells, local cells, and TRXs are operational and that no alarms are raised.

#### 4.3.3.3 Map More Than Two Standards to RF Ports

Mixed mode with more than two standards requires special attention and often

special

downlink configuration depending on the hardware capabilities of

the radio.

It

is necessary to make a comprehensive planning for the RF branches, covering all

nodes to configure which standards are used for a port. If the radio supports NR

standard,

NR

standard can be added on the same RF port. Do not configure more standards than

supported by the radio to use the same RfBranch

MO. For the

supported combination of standards on the same RF port, see Radio Node Configurations.

If two nodes share the antenna and RF port, only one of them can control the TMA, the

RET,

and the power of the RF port.

Prerequisites

The FieldReplaceableUnit MO instance and an appropriate number of

RfBranch MO instances are created.

Steps

In the multistandard Baseband Radio Node:

1. Lock all cells and TRXs for the FieldReplaceableUnit MO allocated to a radio with mixed mode with more than two standards.
2. Set the value of the rfBranchTxRef attribute under the appropriate MO, so that it refers to an RfBranch MO in such a way that only the wanted standards refer to the same RfBranch MO. NR NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef LTE SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef WCDMA NodeBSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef GSM Trx.rfBranchTxRef
3. Choose the appropriate configuration for the appropriate step or steps: Configuration Step One multistandard Baseband Radio Node End the task. One multistandard Baseband Radio Node and a single standard Baseband Radio Node Go to Step 4.

In the single standard Baseband Radio Node:

4. Lock all cells and TRXs for the FieldReplaceableUnit MO allocated to a radio with mixed mode with more than two standards.
5. Set the value of the rfBranchTxRef attribute under the appropriate MO so that it refers to an RfBranch MO in such a way that only the wanted standards refer to the same RfBranch MO. NR NRSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef LTE SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef WCDMA NodeBSectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef GSM Trx.rfBranchTxRef

In the multistandard Baseband node:

6. Unlock all cells and TRXs for each FieldReplaceableUnit allocated to a radio with triple standard mixed mode.

#### 4.3.3.4 Configure Node for Mixed Mode Radio

Prerequisites

- The required licenses are installed.
- The Mixed Mode Radio feature is activated.
- Sufficient level of HWACs must be present for all nodes. For more information, see Hardware-Related Capabilities. Note: In a configuration with multiple MEs, HWACs need to be calculated for each ME.
- The required hardware is installed.
- The conditions stated in Expand Baseband Radio Node are met.

Steps

1. Configure synchronization if the mixed mode configuration has multiple MEs.
2. Connect the Baseband Radio Node to the mixed mode radio by setting the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute to the following values depending on the number of MEs: Number of MEs Attribute Value Multiple MEs true Single ME false
3. Configure the supervision of the antenna system shared by different nodes and standards. Note: The nodes that share the antenna and the RfPort MO must be configured in such way that only one of them controls the TMA, the RET, and the power of the RF port. Improper configuration can damage antenna system resources, such as the RET or the TMA.
4. Configure radio output power.
5. Choose the appropriate action based on node type. Node Type Action NR Unlock all NR cells and sectors. LTE Unlock all LTE cells and sectors. WCDMA Unlock the local cell group and unlock the local cell. Then, unlock the UtranCell MO in the RNC. GSM Unlock TRXs, then take the Transceiver Group into service and unlock it. Result: The node resumes traffic.

If the traffic is not resumed, do the following:

6. Restart the node with restartRank RESTART\_WARM. Tip: If restart is required, it is recommended to initiate the restart at this moment of the procedure. Otherwise, a spontaneous restart can trigger the reconfiguration of the node. Troubleshooting: If the capacity prerequisites are not met, then the Resource Allocation Failure alarm can be expected in case of insufficient resources. This results in failure to activate one or more cells in the existing or the new standard. See the Resource Allocation Failure document for instructions.

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)
9. Wait 15 minutes to ensure that all cells, local cells, and TRXs are operational and that no alarms are raised.

#### 4.3.3.5 Configure TDD Patterns for LTE and NR Mixed Mode Radio

TDD pattern consists of the following NR slots, and LTE subframes:

- Downlink (D)
- Uplink (U)
- Special (S)

The special slot pattern defines

downlink

symbols,

guard

symbols, and uplink symbols within special slot or slots. Symbols are

listed in the downlink:guard:uplink order.

In Mixed Mode Radio TDD configurations, only compatible TDD patterns are allowed.

Compatible TDD patterns allow for the simultaneous transition from uplink to downlink

symbols and from downlink to uplink symbols. Non-identical patterns can damage the

hardware.

Non-identical, but compatible patterns can also be used on CPRI radios that support Mixed

Mode NR+LTE TDD. In this case, a compatibility check and an alignment procedure are

performed for the TDD switch points of all carriers sharing a radio unit. If the

patterns are incompatible, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised.

For more information on TDD patterns and special slot configurations in NR, see Physical Layer

Mid-Band.

Example 1   Identical Pattern

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

- Carrier 1 (NR) The NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to true. The NRCellDU.tddUlDlPattern attribute is set to TDD\_ULDL\_PATTERN\_04 (DDDDDDDSUU). The NRCellDU.tddSpecialSlotPattern attribute is set to TDD\_SPECIAL\_SLOT\_PATTERN\_03 (6:4:4).
- Carrier 2 (LTE) The EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute is set to 2 ms. The EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment attribute is set to 2 (DSUDD). The EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern attribute is set to 7 (10:2:2).

Example 2   Non-Identical Pattern

![Image](../images/138_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.EV33E/additional_3_CP.png)

- Carrier 1 (NR) The NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute is set to true. The NRCellDU.tddUlDlPattern attribute is set to TDD\_ULDL\_PATTERN\_01 (DDDSUUDDDD). The NRCellDU.tddSpecialSlotPattern attribute is set to TDD\_SPECIAL\_SLOT\_PATTERN\_01 (3:8:3).
- Carrier 2 (LTE) The EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute is set to 2 ms. The EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment attribute is set to 2 (DSUDD). The EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePatternattribute is set to 7 (10:2:2).

##### 4.3.3.5.1 Configure Identical TDD Patterns for NR+LTE

Steps

1. Ensure that in LTE, a single uplink or downlink subframe is the same type as the two NR slots in the same position. In case of special slots, comparison is needed for each symbol using the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment and the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.specialSubPattern attributes.
2. Set the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute to true.
3. Use FSO = n x 0.5 ms for calculating carrier offset values.. The difference between the values of the timeOffset member of the EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute of the two carriers must be the multiplication of 0.5 ms

##### 4.3.3.5.2 Configure Identical TDD Patterns for NR+NR

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.tddUlDlPattern attribute on Carrier 1 and Carrier 2 to the same value.
2. Set the NRCellDU.tddSpecialSlotPattern attribute on Carrier 1 and Carrier 2 to the same value.

If a carrier frequency is shared using the

NR+NR

configuration:

3. Set the NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute to true.

##### 4.3.3.5.3 Configure Identical TDD Patterns for LTE+LTE

Steps

1. Set the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment attribute on Carrier 1 and Carrier 2 to the same value.
2. Set the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern attribute on Carrier 1 and Carrier 2 to the same value.
3. Use FSO = n x 0.5 ms for calculating carrier offset values. The difference between the values of the timeOffset member of the EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute of the two carriers must be the multiplication of 0.5 ms.

## 4.4 Reconfigure Mixed Mode Radio

### 4.4.1 Remove Standard from Mixed Mode Radio

To remove a standard running on a node, the appropriate MOs need to be deleted to

free up capacity for the remaining standard or standards. After the corresponding equipment

MOs are removed, the

necessary

hardware

can be removed.

For more information on hardware configurations and hardware capacity, see Manage Hardware Equipment and Radio Node Configurations.

Prerequisites

The UtranCell MO is locked in the RNC, if WCDMA is being removed

and a UTRAN cell is using the WCDMA Local Cell in the RBS,

Steps

1. Lock all the relevant sector carrier, cell, and TRX MO instances. Standard MO NR NRCellDU NRSectorCarrier LTE EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD NbIotCell WCDMA IubLink NodeBLocalCellGroup NodeBLocalCell GSM Trx AbisIp For more information, see Manage GSM Abis Transport. For more information, see Manage Radio Network applicable to the appropriate standard.
2. Delete the appropriate MO instances. Standard MO NR NRSectorCarrier NRCellDU NRCellCU GNBDUFunction GNBCUUPFunction GNBCUCPFunction LTE SectorCarrier EUtranCellFDD EUtranCellTDD NbIotCell ENodeBFunction(1) WCDMA UtranCell NodeBLocalCellGroup IubLink NodeBLocalCell NodeBFunction GSM Trx AbisIp BtsFunction (1) The ENodeBFunction MO must be deleted after all cells are deleted. Result: The ENodeBFunction MO deletion triggers a node warm restart automatically. After the restart, LTE goes into dormant state.

After deleting the NR, WCDMA, or GSM MO

instances:

3. Execute action FieldReplaceableUnit.restartUnit with restartRank RESTART\_WARM. Note: Restarting the Baseband unit can be postponed until an appropriate time to prevent disturbing the traffic on the remaining standards.

### 4.4.2 Remove Node from Mixed Mode Radio

Node removal can be a part of network modernization activities. Removing a node is

necessary

if

the operator is switching from multiple smaller nodes to one larger node.

Capacities cannot be deactivated once they are enabled on the node.

Steps

1. Set the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe attribute to false both on the node that is to be removed and on the remaining node.
2. Reconfigure the supervision of the antenna system shared by the remaining standards. Note: Improper configuration can damage antenna system resources, such as the RET or the TMA. The remaining nodes that share the antenna and the RfPort MO have to be configured in such way that only one of them controls the TMA, the RET, and the power of the RfPort.

### 4.4.3 Deactivate Mixed Mode Radio

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any conflicting

feature.

Prerequisites

Table 19   Deactivation Data

| Standard   | MO Instance                                            |

| GSM        | FeatureState=CXC4012017                                |

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED for the appropriate MO instance of each standard.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

## 4.5 Manage Mixed Mode Radio

Maintenance

action of a node in mixed mode radio might affect the behavior of the other

node.

### 4.5.1 Locking and Restarting Equipment in a Mixed Mode Configuration

Locking and restarting activities have different impact in a mixed mode radio

configuration with multiple MEs compared to a single ME configuration. Locking and

restarting equipment in a configuration with multiple MEs might affect all of the

MEs.

During node restart, the radio unit is not restarted. During RAT restart, the active

alarm list is cleared for the relevant RAT.

For

information

on the restart escalation sequence, see Manage Faults.

Locking and restarting radio units affects the system as follows:

- If a radio unit is locked or set in full maintenance mode, traffic and alarms are suppressed on all related nodes. It is recommended to plan such activities carefully before planning or starting any maintenance activity.
- Restarting radio units causes downtime in corresponding sectors for all standards.

Locking and restarting the nodes affects the system as follows:

- Locking or setting a radio node to full maintenance mode causes all synchronization references to be dependency locked and lost. As a consequence, the radio node enters holdover mode.
- Cold restarts repeated within a very short time affect clock stability, which means that the radio node might not be able to maintain holdover mode.

See

locking cases

that do not lock the radio unit and do not affect the other

standards

in Table 20.

Table 20   Locking Use Cases

## 4.6 Monitor Mixed Mode Radio

### 4.6.1 Performance Management of Mixed Mode Radio

The Mixed Mode Radio feature does not introduce dedicated KPIs, counters, or events

for performance monitoring. However, some existing KPIs might be affected.

Factors, such as inter-modulation and changes in antenna tilt, might affect existing KPIs

and they might be cell-specific. Moreover, if one of the nodes or standards goes out of

service, KPIs in the other ME might be affected.

Antenna System Impact on Performance

To minimize negative impact on KPIs, it is important to plan which antenna to use for

the mixed signal, and what tilt value and azimuth to use.

If

the tilt of an antenna or antenna near unit is changed in a multistandard

configuration, the change affects all standards using the antenna or antenna near

unit. An uptilt change can affect GSM radios because of the range limitation of

these radio units. The Extended Range feature can mitigate this impact. For more

information, see User Description, Extended Range in the GSM

RAN library.

### 4.6.2 Fault Management for Mixed Mode Radio

A faulty ME configuration leads to an alarm on the connected Baseband unit associated

with the ME. The faulty configuration can lead to radio restarts, which disturb the

traffic on all MEs. Otherwise, the other Baseband that shares the equipment is not

disturbed.

If

a configuration fault is detected in a shared unit, an alarm is issued to the node that

made the request. The fault does not disturb traffic on the other node or nodes that

share the equipment.

If

handling the alarm, the operator must identify the faulty node. After radio restart, it

is possible that the non-faulty ME appears faulty. Some faults are caused by radio

overallocation. In this case, the complete mixed mode radio configuration needs to be

checked.

The string Mixed Mode with other ME in an additional text of an alarm

indicates that the unit raising the alarm is shared with an external ME. For such cases,

troubleshooting needs to be done on all nodes that share the equipment. Remedy actions

for alarms are described in the corresponding alarm OPIs. Whether traffic is disturbed

during the resolution of an alarm depends on the remedy actions. For example, if remedy

actions include replacing hardware, upgrading software, or restarting equipment, traffic

is disturbed on all radio nodes that share the equipment.

Locking, restarting, or setting the radio unit in full maintenance mode disables the

radio unit in all connected nodes, regardless if the activity is initiated from one of

the connected nodes or from the radio unit.

Fault Handling for Radio Units with Mixed Mode Radio

When an error occurs in a radio unit, a fault notification is sent to all connected

Radio nodes. As a result, alarms might be triggered. However, alarms of the same

cause might be represented by different specific problems in different radio node

types.

When a configuration fault is detected in a radio unit, the last setup request is

rejected, and an alarm is issued to the node that made the request. The fault can be

in any of the connected nodes, but the alarm is only sent from the affected node,

which is the last one that made the request.

Mixed Mode Radio and Mixed Mode Baseband Handled by One Node

When an error occurs in a radio unit used in Mixed Mode Radio combined with Mixed

Mode Baseband handled by one node, it sends fault indications to the Baseband Radio

Node. As a result, a set of alarms can be triggered.

When a configuration fault is detected in a radio unit connected to a Radio node in

the Mixed Mode Baseband configuration, the last setup request is rejected. The

affected standard raises a service alarm on cell level, either directly or through

the RNC or BSC.

#### 4.6.2.1 Alarms Related to Mixed Mode Radio

When an error occurs in a shared radio, alarms might be raised in all related nodes.

Before taking action to resolve the issue, the other node in the mixed mode radio

configuration must be identified, and coordination regarding alarms must be initiated.

Two alarms generated by the same failure can be named differently in different node

types.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                 | Optional                  |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables the following new Mixed Mode Baseband

configurations:

- NR TDD FR1 CPRI + LTE FDD eCPRI with Radio Gateway Capacity Modules for each standard: Capacity Module B for NR TDD FR1 CPRI Capacity Module B for LTE FDD FR1 for Radio Gateway
- NR TDD FR1 eCPRI with AAS-capable radio unit + LTE FDD eCPRI with Radio Gateway Capacity Modules for each standard: Capacity Module B for NR TDD FR1 eCPRI Capacity Module B for LTE FDD FR1 for Radio Gateway

Compared with enabling LTE FDD eCPRI and NR TDD FR1 CPRI or eCPRI AAS on separate

nodes, enabling them on the same node saves both CAPEX and OPEX.

The eCPRI together with a Radio Gateway enables connecting CPRI based radio units to

the Baseband unit through Ethernet links. The Radio Gateway also acts as a

concentrator that allows connecting many CPRI based radio units to the Baseband unit

over fewer Ethernet links.

Capacity and Performance

For detailed capacity information, see Supported Capacity and Configurations.

Operation

The new configurations are added to the support for producing initial configuration

files used at node integration through the ECT.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The enhancement is applicable to the following hardware:

- RAN Processor 6651

For detailed information on hardware configurations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

Only Radio Gateway units that support for Ethernet based eCPRI transport can be

connected to Baseband units that support for Ethernet based eCPRI transport.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Capacity and Performance

Available throughput HWACs are distributed equally between the LTE capacity modules

that are configured on the same eNodeB. If the node-level throughput HWAC capacity

is less than the maximum throughput supported by the LTE capacity modules, the

maximum throughput capacity of one of the capacity modules cannot be reached.

The downlink and uplink PRB capacity provided by the installed capacity licenses is

distributed equally between the LTE capacity modules that are configured on the same

eNodeB. If the available downlink or uplink PRB capacity is less than two times the

maximum number of downlink or uplink PRBs supported by the LTE capacity modules, the

maximum downlink or uplink PRB capacity of one of the capacity modules cannot be

reached.

The distribution of the available downlink and uplink PRB capacity can be manually

configured through the BbProcessingResource.licCapDistr attribute

for each capacity module.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces penta-mode configuration for mixed mode, which

allows for the configuration of two LTE capacity modules.

This feature enhancement increases the number of

BbProcessingResource MO instances that can be created to

enable the configuration of two capacity modules for the eNodeB. The MO is created

automatically when the first LTE cell for each capacity module is unlocked.

This feature enhancement updates the following attributes to represent the capacity

distribution for each capacity module:

- BbProcessingResource.licCapDistr
- BbProcessingResource.dlBbCapacityNet
- BbProcessingResource.ulBbCapacityNet

All PM counters and attributes under the BbProcessingResource MO

Summary and Benefits

The cold Baseband restart improvement is applicable in the following cases:

- Integrating a Baseband unit with an FRU that is already integrated with another Baseband unit.
- Upgrading an ME with RAN software that includes software for shared FRU.
- Performing a manual cold restart of a Baseband unit.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- The time to enable a cell is reduced on the ME, resulting in less time with traffic loss.
- The external MEs do not experience traffic loss, since no shared FRU restart occurs.
- The external MEs take reduced time to enable a cell when a shared FRU restarts.

The benefits are more significant when the shared FRU is an AAS-capable radio unit,

because this type has longer startup time.

With this enhancement, the attribute for Mixed Mode Radio can be set on the unit level instead

of the sector level. This improves observability: it's fully visible which field

replaceable units are shared by external Managed Elements.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The attribute mixedModeRadio on MO SectorEquipmentFunction is being

deprecated and replaced with attribute

isSharedWithExternalMe.

On Baseband radio nodes, the isSharedWithExternalMe attribute is

under MO FieldReplaceableUnit.

As attribute mixedModeRadio is being deprecated and replaced by

isSharedWithExternalMe, changes made in attribute

mixedModeRadio will be propagated and made visible in

attribute isSharedWithExternalMe.

### Appendix\_A.c.b 21.Q4: Cold Baseband Restart Improvements

With this feature enhancement, the number of shared unit restarts caused by a

Baseband restart due to upgrade or a cold manual restart is reduced. When upgrading to an

older shared unit software, or when performing a manual cold restart when the shared unit

running software is newer, the number of restarts is zero. A shared unit is a Field

Replaceable Unit (FRU) that is connected to more than one external MEs.

Summary and Benefits

The cold Baseband restart improvement is applicable in the following cases:

- Integrating a Baseband unit with an FRU that is already integrated with another Baseband unit.
- Upgrading an ME with RAN software that includes software for shared FRU.
- Performing a manual cold restart of a Baseband unit.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- The time to enable a cell is reduced on the ME, resulting in less time with traffic loss.
- The external MEs do not experience traffic loss, since no shared FRU restart occurs.
- The external MEs take reduced time to enable a cell when a shared FRU restarts.

The benefits are more significant when the shared FRU is an AAS-capable radio unit,

because this type has longer startup time.

Capacity and Performance
