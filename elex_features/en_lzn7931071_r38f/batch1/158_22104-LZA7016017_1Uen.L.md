Hardware

Enhanced DU peak throughput capacity is supported from RAN Compute group 5 and

higher. For more information, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

The feature is supported on the following radio units:

- AIR 5322
- AIR 5343
- Streetmacro 6705

Limitations

High

bit rates from 256-QAM require higher transmission

power,

this limits the range of which transmitted power may be

configured,

therefore the NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute can

be configured to maximum stated EIRP or up to 5 dB lower than the stated

EIRP.

Equal power spectral density is expected across the sector carriers.

Power scaling using the NRSectorCarrier.txPowerRatio attribute is

not recommended.

Network Requirements

The following network element criteria

needs

to be matched:

- 256-QAM downlink capable UE
- 5GC is expected to support high rate
- ENM version 23.1

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR 256-QAM Downlink High-Band

This feature introduces some new parameters while others are deprecated, for more

information see section 23.Q1: NR 256-QAM Downlink High-Band in the Network Impact

Report for NR.

For upgrades from a software that is 23.Q1 or earlier, it is strongly recommended to run

a script to check f

There are guidelines for migration from DU5qi to DrbRlc:

- Two or more Du5qi profiles can have same RLC settings which can be grouped together under single DrbRlc instance.
- Different DrbRlc instances should be used for different RLC settings with DrbRlcUeCfg=Base.
- Different DrbRlcUeCfg instances is add-on after migration and can be used to create different UE groups later.

For customers who are upgrading ENM to 23.Q1 or later, it is recommended to run

pre-migration check in the script drbrlc\_migration.mos after the node upgrade to detect

any existing mismatching DU5qi or DrbRlc configurations. That way, the operator can

correct any mismatches in advance before migration, and thereby avoid failed

configuration, related alarms, and disabled cells. The script can be found in an Excel

file in the Baseband Radio Node ELEX library, the Excel file is called Script for

Checking DU5qi or DrbRlc Configurations.
