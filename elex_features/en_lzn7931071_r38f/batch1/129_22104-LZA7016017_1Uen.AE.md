Summary

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature makes it possible to address specific

delay requirements of different UE groups by allowing different prescheduling modes

to be configured for each predefined UE group.

The ability to configure prescheduling for specific UEs is supported by the UE

Grouping Framework feature.

When using the NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature, uplink prescheduling can be

configured. The feature also introduces a high-priority prescheduling mode that uses

DRB scheduling priority.

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature provides the following benefits:

- Faster time-to-content especially for small data transmission.
- Flexibility to prescheduling mode configuration.
- Reduction in the air interface contribution for end-user latency.

This feature is only applicable in Low-Band

and Mid-Band.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the feature:

- A maximum of two UEs can be configured with high-priority prescheduling for each Capacity Module.
- Only one high-priority prescheduling grant can be scheduled for each slot in a cell.
- This feature is only applicable in Low-Band and Mid-Band.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling introduces MO attributes to configure

prescheduling.

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature allows differentiated uplink prescheduling

for UE groups, supported by the

UE

Grouping Framework. NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling introduces

basic and high-priority prescheduling

modes

which

use

data radio

bearer scheduling to decrease latency for a

limited number of UEs.

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature

checks

each UE to determine which UE group it belongs to, and

selects

the appropriate MOM configuration for the respective prescheduling

mode. For example, it enables high-priority prescheduling mode for the UEs in the

high-priority prescheduling UE

group. A UE in high-priority mode is scheduled with higher

weight than a UE in basic mode.

High-priority

prescheduling has the following limitations:

- A maximum of two UEs can be configured with high-priority prescheduling for each Capacity Module.
- Only one high-priority prescheduling grant can be scheduled for each slot in a cell.

When these limits are reached, new UEs in the high-priority prescheduling group can only

have

basic

prescheduling mode enabled until a space is freed up in one of the

following ways:

- A UE with high-priority prescheduling mode is released.
- A UE with high-priority prescheduling mode reverts to basic prescheduling mode.
- Prescheduling is disabled for a UE with high-priority prescheduling mode.

Basic and high-priority UE groups can be configured by the operator

using

the appropriate MO attributes.

The feature introduces the following MO attributes:

- PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode
- PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDuration
- PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDataSize
- UeBbProfileUeCfg.preschedulingUeCfgRef

The following attributes are placed in the MO class PreschedulingUeCfg

under GNBDUFunction.UeCC.Prescheduling and are configurable for each

UE group:

- PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDuration
- PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDataSize
- PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode

Changes in the preschedulingUeCfg MO class take effect when new

connections are established.

The PreschedulingUeCfgRef MO attribute is placed in the

GNBDUFunction.UeCC.UeBb.UeBbProfile.UeBbProfileUeCfg MO

class.

The preschedulingUeCfg=Base and

UeBbProfileUeCfg=Base MO instances are created automatically when

their parent MO is created. Other preschedulingUeCfg and

UeBbProfileUeCfg MO configurations can be created manually.

The preschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode attribute on the

preschedulingUeCfg=Base MO instance cannot be set to

HIGH\_PRIORITY.

In high-priority prescheduling

mode,

the duration of prescheduling is not limited by the

PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDuration attribute, which only

works in basic prescheduling mode. The

PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDataSize attribute works for

high-priority and basic prescheduling modes.

UE Grouping Framework

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

Capacity and Performance

The latency is decreased for a limited number of UEs configured with high-priority

prescheduling mode.

Prescheduling might increase uplink interference.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The use of ENM 22.05 or later is required to support

the MOM changes introduced by this feature.

If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are

supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 5 Parameters of NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

The feature introduces parameters.

Table 3   Parameters of NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

| Parameter                                | Type       | Description          |
|------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode   | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDataSize | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingDuration | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| UeBbProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList         | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| UeBbProfileUeCfg.preschedulingUeCfgRef   | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| UeBbProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList             | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| NRCellDU.ueBbProfileRef                  | Affected   | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

The feature introduces KPIs and a counter but has no associated events.

Key

Performance

Indicators

NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature might have a negative impact on the average

uplink MAC Cell throughput due to scheduling priority. If there are configured

high-priority prescheduling UEs and multiple uplink UEs, high-priority prescheduling

UEs utilize DRB weight band for weight calculation to be scheduled. In this case,

the uplink throughput and spectral efficiency is decreased since the successfully

scheduled high-priority UE might have no uplink data to transmit.

UEs at the cell edge might have a decreased uplink throughput because of interference

from the neighboring cells.

Counters

This feature introduces the

GNBDUFunction.pmUeConfigProfileOverwrite PM counter to

monitor the number of overwritten UE profiles.

When the number of pre-configured UE profiles reaches the profile limit, the feature

overwrites existing UE profiles for new UE profiles. Overwriting can result in

change in the UE configuration parameters, for example, granted uplink data size or

prescheduling duration. Because of the changes in the parameters, the KPIs related

to the UE performance can indicate performance change.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling

The feature uses the following attributes:

- UeBbProfileUeCfg.preschedulingUeCfgRef
- NRCellDU.ueBbProfileRef

The UeBbProfileUeCfg.preschedulingUeCfgRef attribute is automatically

set to the PreschedulingUeCfg=Base MO instance.

The NRCellDU.ueBbProfileRef attribute is automatically set to the

UeBbProfile=Default MO instance.

If the NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature is activated, the MO attributes of the

selected PreschedulingUeCfg MO instance are used.

If the NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature is deactivated, the MO attributes of the

PreschedulingUeCfg=Base MO instance are

used.

The MO instances are differentiated for UE groups and Preference UE groups with the

UeBbProfileUeCfg.prefUeGroupList and the

UeBbProfileUeCfg.ueGroupList attributes.

The NRCellDU.ueBbProfileRef attribute is used to reference the

UeBbProfile instance to be used in the cell.

If the UeBbProfileUeCfg MO class does not match any of the

UeGroup or PrefUeGroup attributes of a UE, the

UeBbProfileUeCfg=Base fallback option is

selected.

## 9.1 Configure Service-Adaptive Prescheduling for All UE

Steps

1. Set the Prescheduling.preschedulingUeMode attribute to BASIC. Example set GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=Base preschedulingUeMode 1
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)

## 9.2 Configure Service-Adaptive Prescheduling for a Specific UE Group in All Cells

In this example, service-adaptive prescheduling is configured for UEs with

5qi=7.

Prerequisites

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature must be activated.

Steps

1. Create a UE group using a selection criteria for the UE Grouping Framework feature. Example cr ManagedElement=1,GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1 crn ManagedElement=1,GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1,UeGroupSelectionProfile=5QI7 ueGroupId 1 ueGroupPriority 10 selectionCriteria 5qi==7 end
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Create the Prescheduling.PreschedulingUeCfg=5QI7 MO instance with the PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode attribute set to BASIC. Example crn GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=5QI7 preschedulingUeMode 1 end
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
5. Create the UeBbProfileUeCfg=5QI7 MO class with a reference to the PreschedulingUeCfg=5QI7 attribute in the autocreated UeBbProfile=Default MO class for UeGroup 1 and the PreferenceUeGroup 0. Example crn GNBDUFunction 1, GNBDUFunction.UeCC 1, UeCC.UeBb 1, UeBb.UeBbProfile Default, UeBbProfile.UeBbProfileUeCfg 5QI7 prefUeGroupList 0 ueGroupList 1 preschedulingUeCfgRef GNBDUFunction 1, UeCC 1, Prescheduling 1, PreschedulingUeCfg 5QI7 end All UEs that do not match the ueGroupList and prefUeGroupList, are configured with the UeBbProfileUeCfg=Base MO class. Since the preschedulingUeCfgRef attribute is automatically set on the UeBbProfileUeCfg=Base MO class to point to the PreschedulingUeCfg=Base, the 0 (DISABLE) value is used in the preschedulingUeMode attribute.
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)

## 9.3 Configure Service-Adaptive Prescheduling for a Specific UE Group in One Cell

In this example, two UeBbProfile MO classes are used in two

different cells.

The preschedulingUeMode=BASIC attribute is only

applied for UEs with 5QI=7 in the

NRCellDU=1 MO class. Remaining UEs in the

NRCellDU=1 and the UEs in the

NRCellDU=2 MO classes use the

preschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode

DISABLE attribute.

Prerequisites

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature must be activated.

Steps

1. Create a UE group using a selection criteria for the UE Grouping Framework feature. Example cr ManagedElement=1,GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1 crn ManagedElement=1,GNBCUCPFunction=1,UeGroupSelection=1,UeGroupSelectionProfile=5QI7 ueGroupId 1 ueGroupPriority 10 selectionCriteria 5qi==7 end
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
3. Create two PreschedulingUeCfg MO instances. Example crn GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=BASIC preschedulingUeMode 1 end crn GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=DISABLE preschedulingUeMode 0 end
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
5. Create two UeBbProfiles MO instances. Example cr GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=PROFILE1 cr GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=PROFILE2
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
7. Configure cell 1 to reference the UeBbProfile=PROFILE1 MO instance and cell 2 to refer to UeBbProfile=PROFILE2 MO instance. Example set NRCellDU=1 ueBbProfileRef GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=PROFILE1 NRCellDU=2 ueBbProfileRef GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=PROFILE2
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
9. Create the UeBbProfileUeCfg MO instance in both the UeBbProfile=PROFILE1 and the UeBbProfile=PROFILE2 to match UeGroup 1 and PreferenceUeGroup 0. Example crn GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=PROFILE1,UeBbProfileUeCfg=5QI7 prefUeGroupList 0 ueGroupList 1 preschedulingUeCfgRef GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=BASIC end crn GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=PROFILE2,UeBbProfileUeCfg=5QI7 prefUeGroupList 0 ueGroupList 1 preschedulingUeCfgRef GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=DISABLE end
![Image](../images/129_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.AE/additional_3_CP.png)
11. Configure all UeBbProfileUeCfg=BASE MO instances to refer to the PreschedulingUeCfg=DISABLE attribute which is used in both the UeBbProfile=PROFILE1 and the UeBbProfile=PROFILE2 MO instances. Example set UeBbProfileUeCfg=BASE preschedulingUeCfgRef GNBDUFunction=1,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=DISABLE

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces two MOM attributes to configure prescheduling.

With the introduced attributes, the operator can configure prescheduling parameters

for groups of UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The introduction of prescheduling configuration profiles can affect the KPIs related

to UE performance. For example, UE performance can change because of granted uplink

data size or prescheduling duration.

The feature enhancement decreases interference, but uplink latency can increase

depending on the traffic characteristic.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following MO attributes:

- PreschedulingProfile.preschedulingDuration
- PreschedulingProfile.preschedulingDataSize

At the first activation of the NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature, the default

configuration of thePreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode MO

attribute is set to DISABLED.

The NR Service-Adaptive Prescheduling feature can be configured by setting the

PreschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode to

BASIC in the preschedulingUeCfg=Base MO

instance.

When upgrading the feature with this feature enhancement the default configuration of

the preschedulingUeCfg.preschedulingUeMode attribute depends on

the first installed software version containing the attribute..

| First Software Version of NR Service Adaptive Prescheduling   | Feature State   | Default Feature Behavior before Software Upgrade to 22.Q3   | Default Feature Behavior after Software Upgrade to 22.Q3   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 22.Q1 or later                                                | Active          | DISABLE                                                     | DISABLED                                                   |
| 22.Q1 or later                                                | Inactive        | BASIC                                                       | DISABLED                                                   |
| Earlier than 22.Q1                                            | Active          | BASIC                                                       | BASIC                                                      |
| Earlier than 22.Q1                                            | Inactive        | BASIC                                                       | BASIC                                                      |

The feature enhancement configures the following MO references automatically if they

are

missing:

```
NRCellDU ueBbProfileRef GNBDUFunction,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile=Default
GNBDUFunction,UeCC=1,UeBb=1,UeBbProfile,UeBbProfileUeCfg preschedulingUeCfgRef GNBDUFunction,UeCC=1,Prescheduling=1,PreschedulingUeCfg=Base
```

The feature enhancement affects the NRCellDU.ueBbProfileRef

attribute.

With the introduced prescheduling attributes, the operators can configure

prescheduling profiles for groups of UEs.

When the number of preconfigured UE profiles reaches the profile limit, the feature

overwrites the existing UE profiles with new UE profiles. Overwriting can result in

changed UE configuration parameters, for example granted uplink data size or

prescheduling duration. Because of the changes in the parameters, the KPIs related

to UE performance can indicate performance change.

The number of overwritten UE profiles can be monitored with the

GNBDUFunction.pmUeConfigProfileOverwrite counter.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
