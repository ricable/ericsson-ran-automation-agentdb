Summary

The feature provides the possibility to configure SR periodicity pools. Different services

have different needs when accessing a network by using SR. By using the feature, the

preferred SR periodicity can be configured on the cell level to be adapted for a

specific 5QI or a UE group.

In addition, the number of UEs to be allocated with each periodicity can be configured based

on the available PUCCH resources.

Resource allocation for different SR periodicities can be configured by using the periodicity

pools.

The

feature has the following benefits:

- Different scheduling request periodicities can be assigned to UE groups or 5QIs in a flexible way. This is expected to provide the following benefits: Uplink latency performance of prioritized services is expected to improve with initial data transmission. This can be achieved by configuring lower periodicity for dedicated services or prioritizing users for the same service. At high load, prioritized users can be kept at a lower SR periodicity, but PUCCH resources can also allow access for non-prioritized users.
- Different sets of cells, for example, Low-Band and Mid-Band cells in the same node, can be differentiated from each other using multiple instances of SR periodicity.
- PUCCH resources can be saved.
- PUCCH capacity can be increased while maintaining the service performance. Alternatively, service performance can be improved if SR periodicity is assigned on a 5QI level.

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

## 3.1 Configuration of SR Periodicity

Scheduling Request (SR) periodicity can be configured.

The SrPeriodicity.ueConfGroupType attribute defines which UE

configuration group type is applicable in the configuration.

The following attributes define which SR periodicity value is assigned for a certain

pool:

- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool1
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool2
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool3
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool4
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool5

The first pool has the shortest SR periodicity, and each next pool has equal or

higher periodicity than the one before it.

Validation is used to determine which values for SR periodicity are

possible to configure according to the value of the

SrPeriodicityPoolSet.fddTddUlDlPattern attribute. The highest

value for SR periodicity is also protected by the schematron.

## 3.2 Allocation of SR Resources from Each Periodicity Pool

Each cell can have a

different

configuration for a Scheduling Request (SR) periodicity pool defined by

the SR periodicity profile.

The maximum number of UEs that can be configured for each periodicity pool depends on the

total number of available SR resources for the given configuration.

The number of SR resources available for configuration is as follows:

- Each PUCCH PRB has 18 resources available for format PF1. The PF1 format is used for SR and for HARQ ACK and HARQ NACK.
- At cell setup, the number of PRBs assigned for PUCCH is determined based on SR pools and HARQ configuration. The maximum number of SR resources within the SR pools are 56.
- If the cell supports high-speed UEs, 12 PF1 resources are available for each PRB. For cells that support high-speed UEs, the number of SR resources within the SR pools are less than or equal to 32.

The size of the SR periodicity ppols depends on wheter the cell supports high-speer

UEs.

The following attributes define the size of the pool for cells that do not support

high-speed UEs:

- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool1
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool2
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool3
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool4
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool5

The following attributes define the size of the pool for cells that support high-speed

UEs:

- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool1
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool2
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool3
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool4
- SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool5

Schematron rules ensure that the sum of SR resources between all configurable pools for

the cell do not exceed 56 (or 32 for high-speed

UEs).

See Example 1 for an example

configuration.

Example 1   SR Periodicity Pool Configuration

| Pool   | FDD Cells         | TDD Cells         | Description                                      |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pool 1 | 4 slots (4 ms)​   | 10 slots (5 ms)​  | Shortest SR periodicity for prioritized UEs​     |
| Pool 2 | 4 slots (4 ms)​   | 10 slots (5 ms)​  | Shortest SR periodicity for non-prioritized UEs​ |
| Pool 3 | 20 slots (20 ms)​ | 40 slots (20 ms)​ | Medium SR periodicity for prioritized UEs​       |
| Pool 4 | 20 slots (20 ms)​ | 40 slots (20 ms)​ | Medium SR periodicity for non-prioritized UEs​   |
| Pool 5 | 40 sl​ots (40 ms) | 80 slots (40 ms)​ | Long SR periodicity​                             |

## 3.3 Dynamic PUCCH for SR Resources

After the initial Scheduling Request (SR) resource assignment, additional PUCCH PRB

pairs are added dynamically as needed.

At cell setup, initial PUCCH PRB pairs are assigned for SR resources used by up to five

configurable SR periodicity pools.

When the SR resources on initial PUCCH PRB pairs are not enough, additional PUCCH PRB

pairs are added dynamically, which contain non-configurable SR resources with the

longest SR periodicity.

## 3.4 Assignment of SR Periodicity Value to the UE

Scheduling Request (SR) periodicity resources are assigned to UEs depending on cell

load and the configured SR periodicity.

To differentiate UE grouping configurations between a set of cells, multiple

SrPeriodicity MO classes can be added. In this case, the

NRCellDU.srPeriodicityRef attribute refers to the

SrPeriodicty MO class to be used.

The preferred SR periodicity value for a UE group can be configured by using the

SrPeriodicityUeCfg.prefUeSrPeriodicityPool attribute. The SR

periodicity of the preferred pool in the cell is assigned to the UE by using the

RRCReconfiguration message. If there are no resources available for

the preferred pool, the next available pool is assigned to the UE.

During the RRC reconfiguration procedure, the configuration of SR Periodicity for the UE

can change in the following cases:

- The SR resources from the preferred pool become available.
- The preferred SR periodicity pool is changed during the evaluation of UE grouping parameters.

During the RRC setup procedure, before any DRBs are configured, and before the evaluation

of the UE grouping parameters is done, depending on pool availability, SR periodicity

value is assigned to the UE from one of the following pools:

- Last configured pool that has SR resources available is assigned to the UE
- Longest pool from the dynamically configured PUCCH PRB is assigned to the UE
- A lower pool if no SR resources are available in the last configured pool or the longest pool
- If all SR resources are in use, the following procedures are rejected: RRC Setup RRC Resume RRC Reestablishment

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

Uplink throughput, downlink MU-MIMO or downlink carrier aggregation might be impacted

if the NR

High

Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled or high number of SR resources

are configured with short SR periodicity.

Capacity and Performance

If the High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled or a high number of SR resources

are configured with short SR periodicity, this feature enhancement has the following

potential impacts:

- Uplink throughput might decrease when more PRBs are used as PUCCH.
- Downlink MU-MIMO or downlink carrier aggregation might be impacted when more PUCCH PRBs are allocated to PF1, and less are left for PF3.

Interfaces

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

# 6 Performance of NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

The feature introduces two EBS counters in the NRCellDU

MO.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature updates the NRCellDU.pmRrcConnEstabSucc PM

counter.

This feature introduces the following EBS counters in the NRCellDU

MO:

- pmEbsUeCtxtSrPerPrefDistr
- pmEbsUeCtxtSrPerCfgDistr

For information on the EBS counters, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

This feature introduces event parameters and filtering options for PM events:

- The following event parameters are introduced for the DuProcUeContextSetup PM event: sr\_periodicity\_pool\_preferred sr\_periodicity\_pool\_configured
- The following event parameters are introduced for the DuProcUeContextModification PM event: pref\_ue\_group\_id sr\_periodicity\_pool\_preferred sr\_periodicity\_pool\_configured ue\_group\_id ue\_mobility\_group\_id ue\_service\_group\_id ue\_admission\_group\_id
- The following filters are introduced for the UE Grouping Framework: PrefUeGrpId UeGrpId UeMobilityGrpId UeServiceGrpId UeAdmissionGrpId

# 7 Activate NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The NRCellDU MO has a valid reference to the MO instance that corresponds to the SR periodicity pool, so that the feature applies the configured SR periodicity to UEs in the given cell.Note: If no reference is configured at feature activation, SR periodicity configuration is done by the Scheduler Low-Band or Scheduler Mid-Band feature. The SR periodicity configuration depends on the cell configuration, without any SR periodicity configuration options.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012680 MO instance.
3. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012680 MO instance.

Results

There is no need to lock the cell and remove the cell reference to the MO in which

the scheduling request periodicity is defined. The configuration in the cell remains

until the next cell unlock when it changes back to the behavior determined by the

Scheduler Low-Band or Scheduler Mid-Band feature, depending on the cell

configuration.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

## 9.1 Allocate SR Resources From Each Periodicity Pool

Each cell can be configured with different Scheduling Request (SR) periodicity pools,

defined by the SR periodicity profile.

Steps

1. Define the SR Periodicity pool profile by using the following MO attributes: SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPoolSetId SrPeriodicityPoolSet.fddTddUlDlPattern
2. Assign SR periodicity values to the pools by using the following MO attributes: SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool1 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool2 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool3 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool4 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.srPeriodicityPool5
3. Set up the individual SR resources allocated to each pool by using the following MO attributes: For cells that support high speed UEs, configure the following MO attributes: SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool1 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool2 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool3 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool4 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesHsPool5 For cells that do not support high speed UEs, configure the following MO attributes: SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool1 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool2 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool3 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool4 SrPeriodicityPoolSet.noOfSrResourcesPool5
4. Assign the SR periodicity pools to a cell by using the NRCellDU.srPeriodicityPoolSetRef MO attribute.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q3.0: Improved SR Periodicity Alignment with Preferred Value

This feature enhancement reduces the number of times scheduling request

(SR)

periodicity alignment is triggered.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement optimizes the mechanism to

align

the configured SR periodicity with the preferred SR periodicity

to

avoid possible abnormal UE releases. The optimization of the SR

periodicity alignment reduces the number of times the

pmEbsUeCtxtSrPerPoolPrefDistr and the

pmEbsUeCtxtSrPerPoolCfgDistr EBS counters are stepped.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement decreases how often SR periodicity alignment is triggered for

UEs. This also

decreases the number of times

the

following EBS counters are stepped:

- pmEbsUeCtxtSrPerPoolCfgDistr
- pmEbsUeCtxtSrPerPoolPrefDistr

## Appendix A.b: 25.Q1.0: Enhanced Utilization of PUCCH PRBs for NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity

This feature enhancement allows for the configuration of SR periodicity and the

support of the maximum number of NR RRC-connected UEs in the cell at the same

time.

| Feature Name           | NR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5595                         |
| Value Package Name     | Performance Boost                    |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4021                         |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                  |
| Access Type            | NR                                   |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement improves the utilization of PUCCH PRBs for the NR

Service-Adaptive

SR Periodicity feature, enabling it to support the maximum number

of NR RRC-connected UEs in the cell at the same time.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits in case a high number of SR

resources are used with short SR periodicity:

- Increased number of RRC-connected UEs for each cell
- Increased ratio of RRC Establishment Success

Capacity and Performance

The increased number of NR RRC-connected UEs for each cell can be observed through

the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmActiveUeDlSum
- NRCellDU.pmActiveUeDlSamp
- NRCellDU.pmActiveUeDlMax
- NRCellDU.pmActiveUeUlSum
- NRCellDU.pmActiveUeUlSamp
- NRCellDU.pmActiveUeUlMax
- NRCellDU.pmRrcConnLevelMaxSa
- NRCellDU.pmDrbLevelMaxSa
- NRCellDU.pmRrcConnLevelMaxEnDc
- NRCellDU.pmDrbLevelMaxEnDc
- NRCellDU.pmRrcConnEstabSucc

If the High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature is enabled or a high number of SR resources

are configured with short SR periodicity, this feature enhancement has the following

potential impacts:

- Uplink throughput might decrease when more PRBs are used as PUCCH.
- Downlink MU-MIMO or downlink carrier aggregation might be impacted when more PUCCH PRBs are allocated to PF1, and less are left for PF3.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is applicable to RAN Compute units in the following RAN

Compute groups:

- RAN Compute group 4
- RAN Compute group 5
- RAN Compute group 6

Other Network Elements

No impact.
