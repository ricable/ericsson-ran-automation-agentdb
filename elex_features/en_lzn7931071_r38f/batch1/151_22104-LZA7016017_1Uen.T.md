Summary

With this feature, only UEs with the n77 capability extension can access the 3,450-3,550 MHz

or the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band. UEs can only access

the frequency range that is indicated by their extended n77 band RF parameter.

Access for other UEs is barred by broadcasting a network signaling value in the SIB1

message.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following network

elements:

- It is required to use ENM version 23.2 or later to support this feature.
- The UE must support the n77 band extension.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Extended N77 Band Support

The feature operates by prompting UE capability validation through the transmission

of a network signaling value and restricting access to the extended frequency range of the

n77 band only to UEs that support the extension.

UE access is managed through the following processes:

- UE capability validation
- Transmission of the appropriate network signaling value in the SIB1 message by the gNodeB to bar access for UEs that do not support the extension

To determine if the UE supports the extended n77 band, the

UECapabilityInformation RRC message is checked for the appropriate RF

parameter.

UE capability validation is performed in the following processes:

- RRC processes: Initial context setup NR RRC connection re-establishment RRC connection resume
- Handover preparation
- Secondary node addition
- SCell selection for carrier aggregation
- Measurement configuration: NR inter-frequency selection for A5 measurement configuration: Mobility control at poor coverage for NR standalone Mobility control at poor coverage for EN-DC PSCell change to higher priority Multi-layer coordination Minimization of Drive Tests NR soft cell lock

Cells operating at a frequency range of the extended n77 band broadcast a specific

network signaling value in the SIB1 message to bar access for UEs without the n77

extension capability.

Figure 1   SIB1 Broadcast and UE Handling

To enable the feature at a given frequency range of the extended n77 band, the

NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute must be set to the

appropriate network signaling value.

UEs that fail the capability validation are rejected from accessing the cell. Capability

validation is failed if the UE does not indicate the correct RF parameter on the

appropriate frequency range of the extended n77 band.

Operational Process

Based on the evaluation of the received UE capability information, the gNodeB

proceeds with either of the following:

- The gNodeB reconfigures the UE to the appropriate frequency range of the extended n77 band. Mobility and SCell allocation to the extended n77 band are supported by the network.
- The gNodeB provides a mechanism for the handling of UEs that fail the capability validation and bars access to the extended n77 band cell as both SpCell or SCell.

UE Capability Validation at Initial Context Setup

Figure 2   UE Capability Validation at Initial Context Setup

1. The RRCSetupRequest message is received.
2. UE capability inquiry is initiated.
3. After receiving the UECapabilityInformation message, it is evaluated. The gNodeB reconfigures the UE to the appropriate frequency range of the extended n77 band. Mobility and SCell allocation to the extended n77 band is supported by the network.
4. If the UE does not indicate capability with the appropriate RF parameter, RRC connection release with redirect to LTE is initiated. Otherwise, the connection is established.

UE Capability Validation for Handover Preparation

The gNodeB reconfigures the UE to the appropriate frequency range of the extended n77

band. Mobility and SCell allocation to the cells operating at this frequency range

of the n77 band are only allowed for UEs that indicate the n77 capability

extension.

Figure 3   UE Capability Validation for Handover Preparation

1. The gNodeB validates the UE capability during incoming Xn handover if the target cell is at a frequency range of the extended n77 band.
2. If the UE capability validation is failed, the gNodeB rejects incoming Xn handover.

If the GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77Supported or the

GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute is set

to false on the source gNodeB or the target gNodeB is not upgraded

for this feature, the source gNodeB sends the HANDOVER REQUEST

message to UEs not supporting the n77 capability extension. In this case, the target

gNodeB validates the UE capability and sends the HANDOVER PREPARATION

FAILURE message.

In case of an NG-based handover, the target gNodeB sends the HANDOVER

FAILURE message to the AMF if the UE does not support the n77

extension.

UE Capability Validation for Secondary Node Addition

If the UE capability message indicates the extended n77 band RF parameter, EN-DC

setup for the appropriate frequency range of the extended n77 band is allowed. If

the UE capability validation is failed, the EN-DC setup request is rejected.

Figure 4   UE Capability Validation for Secondary Node Addition

If the eNodeB receives the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message with

the radioNetwork:unspecified cause value, the target cell is excluded

and is no longer used for the SgNB addition request until UE release.

The eNodeB sends the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message to UEs not

supporting the n77 capability extension in the following cases:

- The ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77Supported attribute or the EnodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute is set to false on the eNodeB.
- The eNodeB is not upgraded for this feature.

In these cases, the gNodeB validates the UE capability and sends the SGNB

ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message.

NR Inter-Frequency Selection for A5 Measurement Configuration

The gNodeB configures UEs with the appropriate frequency range of the extended n77

band for A5 measurement configuration based on the presence of the applicable RF

parameter in the UE capability message.

The 3,450-3,550 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band frequencies are removed

if the following condition applies:

- The GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77Supported attribute is set to true.
- The UE capability does not indicate the extendedBand-n77-r16 RF parameter.

The 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band frequencies are removed

if the following criteria are fulfilled:

- The GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute is set to true.
- The UE capability does not indicate the extendedBand-n77-2-r17 RF parameter.

Interaction with Carrier Aggregation

For UEs with the n77 capability extension, the frequency ranges of the extended n77

band cell can be configured to the SCell.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Extended N77 Band Support

This feature improves UE throughput for UEs that support the feature by enabling the

exclusive use of the extended n77 band frequency ranges.

Capacity and Performance

UE throughput increases because the gNodeB can configure capable UEs with cells

operating at the extended n77 band as SpCell or SCell.

EN-DC setup can increase because an additional cell operating at the extended n77

band can be included.

If the extended n77 band is deployed in a network without feature activation or if it

is not supported by all nodes, the following KPIs can decrease:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- NR Handover success rate captured in source gNodeB

The DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for mapped 5QI KPI can be degraded if a

significant number of UEs without the n77 capability extension request access to

cells that operate at the extended n77 band.

Interfaces

This feature affects the Uu interface in the following way:

- The UECapabilityInformation message is checked for the appropriate RF parameter to identify if the UE supports the feature.
- The SIB1 message is configured with network signaling value 55 or 57 to bar access for UEs that do not support the appropriate RF parameter.

# 5 Parameters for NR Extended N77 Band Support

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

frequency range of the extended n77 band. The 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the

n77 band is available for UEs that support the extended n77 band.

Capacity and Performance

UE throughput increases for capable UEs if the gNodeB configures them with an SCell

or an SpCell that operates at the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended

n77 band.

This feature enhancement improves the Average DL MAC Cell Throughput KPI.

This feature enhancement can increase the value of the following PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc

following KPIs can be degraded:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB
- NR Handover Success Rate Captured in Source gNodeB

If a significant number of UEs without the n77 capability extension request access to

cells operating at the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band, the

following KPIs can be degraded:

- Total DRB Accessibility - Success Rate for Mapped 5QI
- RRC Reestablishment Success Rate

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported
- GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported

Access for UEs that lack support for the extended n77 band is barred by broadcasting

the network signaling value 57 in the SIB1 message.

The following attributes must be configured to enable this feature enhancement in NR

standalone deployment:

- The GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute must be set to true.
- The NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute value must be set to 57.

The following attributes must be configured to enable this feature enhancement in

EN-DC deployment:

- The GNBCUCPFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute must be set to true.
- The NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute value must be set to 57.
- The ENodeBFunction.extendedBandN77TwoSupported attribute must be set to true.

If the NRCellDU.networkSignalValue attribute value is set to

57, the following requirements must be fulfilled:

- The NRCellDU.bandListManual attribute must contain 77 only.
- The value of the NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL attribute must be in the range of 643334-665333.

Interfaces

This change affects the Uu interface by updating the

UECapabilityInformation message with the

extendedBand-n77-2-r17 IE to identify if the UE supports

the 3,650-3,980 MHz frequency range of the extended n77 band.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

This feature enhancement requires the following network elements:

- It is required to use ENM version 23.2 or later for this feature enhancement.
- The UE capability must indicate the extendedBand-n77-2-r17 RF parameter.
