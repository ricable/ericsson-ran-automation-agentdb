# 1 NR Combined Cell Overview

The feature enables combined cells in NR Low-Band and Mid-Band deployments.

| Feature Name           | NR Combined Cell                                                           |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

A combined cell is a logical cell that contains multiple sectors carriers. The border

of this cell is the combined border for all sector carriers in it.

The feature supports a mixed configuration of non-combined and combined cells on the same

node, with up to six sector carriers in a combined cell. The UE does not experience

any NR cell change at sector carrier switching within the combined cell.

Maximum one NR combined cell is supported for each RAN Compute unit.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Extended single cell coverage
- Simplified cell planning and management by reducing the number of cells
- Improved mobility by eliminating the need for inter-cell handovers within a combined cell

# 2 Dependencies of NR Combined Cell

The feature has dependencies and limitations related to cell and sector carrier

management.

- RAN Compute group 4c with Capacity Module A and B
- RAN Compute group 5a with Capacity Module B and C
- RAN Compute group 5b with Capacity Module B and C

- RAN Compute group 4b with Capacity Module C

The following CPRI-based radio configurations are supported:

- 1TX/1RX
- 2TX/2RX
- 4TX/4RX

Combined cells are only supported on Remote radio units with external antenna.

Indoor Connect 8855 is supported only in multi-operator configurations, and only for

the operator with the Baseband where the CPRI data does not go through the Indoor

Connect 8855. For more information, see Features for Radio Configurations.

Limitations

- Up to 16 preambles are supported.
- If an NR combined cell is configured for one of the following RAN Compute groups, the GNBDUFunction.capacityAllocationPolicy attribute must be set to SYSTEM\_SELECTED and all sector carriers belonging to the NR combined cell must be connected to the same RI port group: RAN Compute group 5c with Capacity Module A RAN Compute group 5d with Capacity Module A RAN Compute group 6a with Capacity Module B RAN Compute group 6b with Capacity Module B
- Adding and removing sector carriers in a combined cell can be done only if the cell and all sector carriers in the cell are locked.
- The sector carriers that belong to the same combined cell must have the same number of antennas, antenna ports, and the same output power setting configurations, including the maximum output power.
- The distance between two antennas of the combined cell must not exceed 510 meters for Mid-Band deployments, and 1220 meters for Low-Band deployments.
- If a sector carrier that is included in a combined cell is disabled or degraded, the system initiates an automatic cell lock and unlock to exclude it from the combined cell. If the disabled or degraded sector carrier becomes enabled, the system initiates an automatic cell lock and unlock to include it in the combined cell.
- Automatic migration is not supported.
- Mixed mode Baseband configuration with a Low-Band and a Mid-Band combined cell is not supported.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

management of combined cells.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Combined Cell

The feature allows multiple sector carriers to belong to the same cell.

All sector carriers that are present in the same cell are considered as one logical cell

with the same PCI.

Figure 1   Concept of Combined Cell

The feature supports uplink sector carrier selection within the same cell. All sector

carriers detect random access preambles, and receive PUCCH. To prepare for when a UE

sends PUSCH data, the best sector carrier is selected in the gNodeB based on the

following considerations:

- The initial sector carrier selection for a UE is based on random access preamble detections.
- After that, sector carrier selection for a UE is based on PUCCH and PUSCH power measurements.

When a UE moves from the area covered by one sector carrier to another, the sector

carrier switch is done in uplink instead of cell handover or cell reselection. During

the switch, uplink and downlink data are not interrupted for the UE.

The feature supports a mixed configuration of non-combined cells and combined cells.

Figure 2   Example of Using Mixed Configuration with Non-Combined Cells and a Combined

Cell

# 4 Network Impact of NR Combined Cell

The feature extends cell coverage and improves mobility handling.

Capacity and Performance

The feature extends the coverage within the cell. The cell capacity of the combined

cell is not affected. A combined cell has the same capacity as a cell that is not

combined.

Mobility handling is improved by eliminating the need for inter-cell handover within

a combined cell. A reduction in the number of handovers might be observed.

The total cell unlock time increases with the number of sector carriers referenced by

the combined cell.

For more information, see Features for Radio Configurations.

Interfaces
