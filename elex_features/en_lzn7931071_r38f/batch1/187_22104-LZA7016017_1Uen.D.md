Summary

The feature allows the operator to change scheduling priorities by enabling the following operations:

| Elevation time scheduling operation   |    | The operation elevates the scheduling priorities of DRBs when the scheduling delay exceeds 								a configured threshold. This way, the risk that the scheduling delay 								requirements are not met at the current priority level is 								minimized.  With this operation, the priority of DRBs is elevated when needed, 								which provides more scheduling opportunities for other traffic that 								serves other services.   |

|                                       |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Maximum waiting time operation        |    | This operation is applied for all DRBs in a cell, where DRBs are scheduled with priorities 								according to configuration. The maximum waiting time operation 								elevates the scheduling priority when a DRB is not scheduled for a 								specified time. As a result, the operation can mitigate the risk of 								radio link failure in a cell.                                                                                |

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Delay-Controlled Scheduling

The feature enables resource allocation for DRBs by using delay-controlled

operations.

The feature dynamically changes the priority domain by using the elevation time

scheduling operation and the maximum waiting time operation. The priority domain shift

is applied in the PCell.

## 3.1 Elevation Time Scheduling Operation

The feature changes the scheduling priorities of DRBs by using the elevation time

scheduling operation.

If any of the following attributes is set to ELEVATION\_TIME, the NR

Delay-Controlled Scheduling feature uses the elevation time scheduling operation to

elevate the scheduling priorities of DRBs:

- SchedulingProfile.ulSchedulingAlgorithm
- SchedulingProfile.schedulingAlgorithm

For the DRBs configured for the elevation time scheduling operation, the feature collects

the following information:

- In uplink, the gNodeB measures the time elapsed from the first scheduling after the SR response is transmitted.
- In downlink, the gNodeB measures the age of the packet.

The feature dynamically performs the priority domain shift for the DRB based on the

comparison of the measurement and the configured threshold. Based on the comparison, the

following outcomes are possible for the DRB:

- If the elevation time exceeds the configured threshold, the priority domain of the DRB shifts to an elevated state. In uplink, the elevated priority domain is kept until the buffer is emptied. The elevated priority domain value can be configured with the DU5qi.priorityLevel attribute.
- If the elevation time does not exceed the configured threshold, the priority domain of the DRB remains on a demoted state. The demoted priority domain can be configured by setting the following attributes to HIGH or LOW: UlDelayBasedPriority.ulDemotedPriority DlDelayBasedPriority.dlDemotedPriority

Figure 1   Elevation Time Scheduling Operation

Table 2 shows the configurable values for the

elevation time scheduling operation. The priority value expresses the priority domain,

where 1 is the highest priority and 64 is the lowest priority.

Table 2   Configurable Priority Domain Values for the Elevation Time Scheduling

Operation

| Scheduling Operation   | Priority Domain   | Priority Value                                     | Attribute                                                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elevation time         | Elevated          | The configurable values depend on the 5QI profile. | DU5qi.priorityLevel                                                            |
| Elevation time         | Demoted HIGH      | 48                                                 | UlDelayBasedPriority.ulDemotedPriority  DlDelayBasedPriority.dlDemotedPriority |
| Elevation time         | Demoted LOW       | 52                                                 | UlDelayBasedPriority.ulDemotedPriority  DlDelayBasedPriority.dlDemotedPriority |

## 3.2 Maximum Waiting Time Operation

The operation elevates the scheduling priority for a DRB that is not scheduled by the

time the maximum waiting time elapses.

If any of the following attributes is set to a higher value than 0, the

NR Delay-Controlled Scheduling feature uses the maximum waiting time operation to

elevate the scheduling priorities of DRBs when they are not scheduled for the configured

time:

- CellPriorityShift.cellDlMaxWaitingTime
- CellPriorityShift.cellUlMaxWaitingTime

The operation applies to all DRBs in a cell.

For the maximum waiting time operation, the following outcomes are possible:

- If the last scheduling time of the DRBs in a cell exceeds the configured threshold, the priority domain of the DRBs shifts to an elevated state. The elevated priority domain can be configured by setting the following attributes to HIGH or LOW: CellPriorityShift.cellMwtDlElevatedPriority CellPriorityShift.cellMwtUlElevatedPriority
- If the last scheduling time of the DRBs in a cell does not exceed the configured threshold, the priority domain is used according to the scheduler configuration.

elevated priority domain of the maximum waiting time configuration.

|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum waiting time | HIGH              |                4 | CellPriorityShift.cellMwtDlElevatedPriority  CellPriorityShift.cellMwtUlElevatedPriority |
| Maximum waiting time | LOW               |               22 | CellPriorityShift.cellMwtDlElevatedPriority  CellPriorityShift.cellMwtUlElevatedPriority |

# 4 Network Impact of NR Delay-Controlled Scheduling

The feature can improve the performance of traffic that serves other services and

mitigate the risk of radio link failure.

Capacity and Performance

The elevation time scheduling operation can improve the performance of traffic that

serves other services by not adding unnecessary priority to DRBs configured with

high priority.

The maximum waiting time operation can reduce the risk of radio link failure caused

by long waiting time for scheduling for DRBs in RLC acknowledged mode because of

reduced risk of not receiving RLC status reports on time.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Delay-Controlled Scheduling

The feature introduces multiple attributes to support the elevation time scheduling

operation and the maximum waiting time operation.
