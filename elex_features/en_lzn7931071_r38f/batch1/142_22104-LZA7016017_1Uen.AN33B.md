Summary

At high PDCCH load, the number of allocated PDCCH symbols can be increased by using

available PDSCH resources in Mid-Band and Low-Band cells. In Mid-Band cells, up to

two PDCCH symbols can be allocated. In Low-Band cells, up to three PDCCH symbols can

be allocated.

The number of enabled PDCCH symbols can be configured in the following ways:

| Static symbol allocation   |    | Allocates a fixed number of symbols for PDCCH                                               |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

PDCCH search space configuration must be compliant with 3GPP restrictions. The number

of candidates for each aggregation level for the multi-symbol configuration can be

different from the MINIMUM configuration.

Multiple PDCCH symbol configurations can improve PDCCH blocking performance for cells

with high PDCCH demands. Because of the change in the number of candidates, the

blocking performance might not always be improved in cells with low PDCCH

demands.

Network Requirements

ENM version 22.2 or later is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid Band

This feature allows the configuration of PDCCH to span multiple symbols in case of NR

standalone and EN-DC deployments.

The PDCCH carries the Downlink Control Information (DCI), mapped to the PDCCH in the

first symbol or the first symbol and additional symbols in every downlink slot. This is

realized by the configuration of a common search space (CSS) and a UE-specific search

space (USS). Both search spaces have a monitoring periodicity of one slot with the

duration of one symbol. This applies to all supported bandwidths except for that of 5

MHz. On 5 MHz bandwidths, the duration of the monitoring periodicity equals two

symbols.

Downlink time and the frequency resources for the PDCCH are allocated in the form of a

Control Resource Set (CORESET). In NR standalone deployment without multiple BWPs, the

following types of CORESETs are configured:

- CORESET#0 is configured for the CSS
- CORESET#1 is configured for the USS

CORESET#0 is not configured for PDCCH in EN-DC deployments, as LTE is used for common

control signaling. CORESET#1 is configured for both common and UE-specific search

spaces.

PDCCH symbols can be configured in the following ways:

- Static and dynamic symbol allocation in Low-Band cells
- Dynamic symbol allocation in Mid-Band cells

## 3.1 Mitigation of High Downlink BLER in SIB1 Slots at Feature Activation

If SIB1 to PDSCH data interference is high at the activation of this feature, the NR

Slot-Specific Downlink Link Adaptation feature can be used to mitigate high

BLER.

Without multiple PDCCH symbols, symbol 0 has limited or no capacity for USS, as it is

already used by CSS in SIB1. If the NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid Band feature is

activated with dynamic symbol allocation, PDSCH data can be scheduled in SIB1 slots.

This is possible because either or both of the symbol 1 or symbol 2 can be allocated to

schedule data for USS. The PDSCH data scheduled in the PRB range within CORESET#0 can

experience interference from SIB1 signals in neighbor cells, potentially leading to high

BLER in

SIB1.

High BLER is possible if the following conditions are all fulfilled:

- The value of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute is set to ADAPT\_MAX\_2 or to ADAPT\_MAX\_3.
- The value of the NRCellDU.pdschStartPrbStrategy attribute is set to RANDOM\_START\_WITHIN\_BAND.
- Small bandwidth is configured.Note: The following bandwidths are defined as small bandwidths for the purposes of this feature: 10 MHz and 15 MHz for FDD 20 MHz and 30 MHz for TDD

To mitigate downlink BLER, the NR Slot-Specific Downlink Link Adaptation feature can be

enabled and the parameters in the NRCellDu.slotSpecificDlLaConfigList

attribute can be configured to implement a slot-level SINR backoff in SIB1 slots.

Slot-level PIs, such as

Downlink

Initial HARQ BLER can be used to monitor

BLER and adjust the value of the sinrBackoff attribute member.

Estimation of the SIB1 interference level in live networks depends on the following

factors:

- Cell or site configuration
- UE distribution
- Traffic model

As a result, there is no universal value for the

sinrBackoff

attribute member, but a higher sinrBackoff value generally results

in a lower BLER.

## 3.2 Resource Allocation in Low-Band

The feature can be used to configure PDCCH in Low-Band cells to improve how increased

traffic demand is handled depending on the nature of the traffic and the bandwidth of the

cell.

With this feature, the PDCCH can be configured to span a maximum of three symbols in each

slot in Low-Band cells to improve how increased traffic demand is handled. The feature

operation in a cell is enabled and configured using the

NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute. The cell can be configured

for static or dynamic PDCCH allocation.

Table 2 lists the supported configuration

values of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute on the supported

bandwidths in Low-Band cells. PDSCH Mapping type A is used in all cases.

Flexible channel bandwidth in the downlink

The following values of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig are recommended

to be set for specific bandwidths in Low-Band cells:

- For a 40 MHz or 50 MHz bandwidth, the recommended value is MINIMUM.
- For bandwidths between 25 MHz and 35 MHz, when dynamic allocation is required, the recommended value is ADAPT\_MAX\_2.
- For a 10 MHz bandwidth without the Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature or a 15 MHz or 20 MHz bandwidth, when additional PDCCH capability is required, the recommended value is ADAPT\_MAX\_3.
- For a 5 MHz or 10 MHz bandwidth, when additional PDCCH capability is required, the recommended value is STATIC\_3.

For a 15 MHz bandwidth in Low-Band cells, if additional PDCCH capability is

required for an extended amount of time, using the STATIC\_3 value can

give a more stable performance than the ADAPT\_MAX\_3 value. For more

information, see 3GPP TS 38.213, NR; Physical layer procedures for

control.

Static Symbol Allocation for the PDCCH in Low-Band

Figure 1   Static Symbol Allocation

A fixed number of symbols can be allocated for the PDCCH with static allocation

selected. Setting the value of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig

attribute to STATIC\_2 or STATIC\_3 means that two

or three symbols are allocated for the PDCCH.

Only one UE-specific search space is available when 5 MHz and 10 MHz bandwidths with

CRB blanking are used, using a two-symbol or three-symbol CORESET.

Dynamic Symbol Allocation for the PDCCH in Low-Band

Figure 2   Dynamic Symbol Allocation

If the value of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbolConfig attribute is set to

ADAPT\_MAX\_2 or ADAPT\_MAX\_3, the number of

symbols allocated for the PDCCH adapt dynamically to traffic demand. Traffic demand

evaluation is done for each slot. At high traffic load, the feature allocates more

symbols for the PDCCH, while at low traffic load, only one symbol might be

allocated. The utilization of PDSCH resources is improved and impact on NR data

throughput decreases.

Dynamic PDCCH allocation is supported only for configurations that can use one-symbol

CORESET#1.

The number of USSs depends on the value of the

NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute. The following cases are

possible:

- When ADAPT\_MAX\_2 is configured, one or two USSs exist in symbol zero, or in symbols zero and one.
- When ADAPT\_MAX\_3 is configured, one, two, or three USSs exist in symbol zero, symbols zero and one, or symbols zero, one, and two.

For more information on related concepts, see Control Channel Guideline NR and Physical Layer Low-Band.

## 3.3 Resource Allocation in Mid-Band

The feature can be used to configure the flexible allocation of more PDCCH resources

in Mid-Band cells to improve how increased traffic demand is handled.

With this feature, the PDCCH can be configured to span a maximum of two symbols in each

slot in Mid-Band cells improve how increased traffic demand is handled. If the value of

the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute is set to

ADAPT\_MAX\_2, dynamic two-symbol PDCCH is enabled. This

configuration allows for the allocation of the PDCCH to two slots, depending on the load

of the PDCHH.

Table 3 lists the supported configuration

values of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute on the supported

bandwidths in Mid-Band cells. PDSCH mapping type A is used in all cases.

Table 3   Supported NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig Attribute Values for Each Cell Bandwidth in

Mid-Band Cells

| NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig   | 10 MHz   | 15 MHz   | 20 MHz   | 30 MHz   | 40 MHz   | 50 MHz   | 60 MHz   | 70 MHz   | 80 MHz   | 90 MHz   | 100 MHz   |
|----------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| MINIMUM                    | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes       |
| ADAPT_MAX_2                | No       | No       | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes      | Yes       |

Dynamic Symbol Allocation for the PDCCH

Figure 3   Dynamic Symbol Allocation for the PDCCH in Mid-Band

If the value of the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbolConfig attribute is set to

ADAPT\_MAX\_2, the number of symbols allocated for the PDCCH

adapt dynamically to traffic demand. The traffic demand evaluation is done on a slot

basis. At high traffic load, the feature allocates two symbols for the PDCCH, while

at low traffic load, only one symbol might be allocated. Dynamic PDCCH allocation

allows for improved utilization of PDSCH resources.

Dynamic PDCCH allocation is supported for configurations that can use CORESET#0 and

CORESET#1. Standalone and non-standalone UEs can use CORESET#0 and CORESET#1. UEs

that can only be configured with non-standalone cell deployments can only use

CORESET#1.

The number of USSs depends on the value of the

NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute. When the value of the

NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute is set to

ADAPT\_MAX\_2, two USSs exist on CORESET#1. One USS is on symbol

zero, while the other USS is on symbol one.

For more information on related concepts, see Control Channel Guideline NR and Physical Layer Mid-Band.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid Band

This feature improves PDCCH capacity in cells with increased traffic

demand.

Capacity and Performance

When the traffic in a cell increases and more symbols are allocated for PDCCH, the

number of scheduling entities increases. This increases downlink assignment and

uplink grant allocation capacity, which might increase cell throughput and decrease

latency. The added PDCCH capacity allows for more of the available PDSCH resources

to be scheduled, which are otherwise blocked by the shortage of the PDCCH capacity.

This might increase downlink throughput despite the fewer number of symbols

available for PDSCH.

In Low-Band cells, the additional PDCCH can be allocated in a dynamic or a static

manner, depending on the configuration. Downlink throughput might decrease when up

to three symbols are used for PDCCH, as decreasing the number of symbols available

for PDSCH reduces the PDSCH resources.

In Mid-Band cells, the additional PDCCH can be dynamically allocated to improve PDCCH

capacity during high traffic load.

The increase of PUSCH and PDSCH or the decrease of PDSCH throughput depends on the

traffic load, the traffic pattern, and the UE distribution in the cell.

Interfaces

The feature affects the Uu interface. The RRCReconfiguration and

RRCSetup messages are updated with the chosen PDCCH and

PDSCH configuration.

When three symbols are allocated for PDCCH, the following IEs of the Master

Information Block (MIB) message are affected:

- The searchSpaceZero IE of the pdcch-ConfigSIB1 IE, shifting the SSB position
- The dmrs-TypeA-Position IE, shifting the DMRS position to avoid overlapping with PDCCH symbols

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid Band

number of allocated PDCCH symbols increases.

For more information on EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

The feature affects the DuPerCellResourceRep event, improving the cell resource

report by considering MCS distribution.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It can increase total cell throughput and decrease latency at high PDCCH load by enabling up to three PDCCH symbols.
- The number of symbols allocated for PDCCH can be increased by using available PDSCH resources at high PDCCH load.

The number of enabled PDCCH symbols affects the number of available PDSCH

symbols.

The number of enabled PDCCH symbols can be configured in two ways. Static symbol

allocation enables a fixed number of symbols. Dynamic symbol allocation changes the

number of enabled symbols according to the traffic conditions on Transmission Time

Interval (TTI) basis.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement can increase cell throughput capacity and decrease latency

by using two or three PDCCH symbols depending on the traffic load. This increases

the amount of scheduled PDSCH resources by reducing PDCCH capacity shortage.
