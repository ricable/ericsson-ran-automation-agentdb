of the hardware and software with the prerequisites stated in Instantaneous Licensing.

Commercial Readiness

Analyze the commercial readiness of the RAN and identify if there are following

fingerprints:

- The fingerprints with entitlements are activated from more than one EUFT group. In such cases, identified fingerprints and entitlements must be cleaned up before migration to Instantaneous Licensing.
- The fingerprints include licenses which are wrongly activated or include licenses which are not compliant with LCS and HCS definitions as follows: Wrong price model for HWACs Multiple or wrong payment models Inconsistent base package or value package sets Overactivation of HWACs or capacity license objects Old licenses or HWACs, for example, DU licenses Restricted features It is recommended to perform ELIS clean-up for all identified nodes.

Radio Node Configuration Types

Analyze the radio node configuration types in the network and how they might benefit

from Instantaneous Licensing by doing the following:

- Compare the radio node types with the Instantaneous Licensing support that is offered for different RATs in the given RAN software release.
- Study the supported radio node configurations and limitations in the given RAN software release.

ENM Security

Determine the ENM security setup for Instantaneous Licensing deployment by confirming

with the ENM system administrator which mutual authentication option is used between

ENM and CAS-Customer. The following three methods are available:

- CAS CA and ENM CA are independent.
- ENM PKI generates certificates for both Software Hardware Manager and CAS. Note: This is the recommended method. For more information, see section Mutual Authentication Setup between ENM and CAS-C in the ENM Configuration System Administrator Guide.
- ENM CA is connected to the external CA and ENM generates certificates for Software Hardware Manager and CAS.

## 2.3 Operational Impact Analysis

The goal of this task is to analyze the operational impact of Instantaneous Licensing. It

is recommended to document all findings of this analysis in an Operation Solution

Deployment Analysis report.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

Impact on Operation

Analyze how operation is affected for the following cases:

- Additional radio node hardware or software configurations are introduced and updates of the License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) are required.
- Radio nodes are introduced, replaced, migrated, moved, upgraded, or reconfigured and handling of related licenses is affected.
- Communication about changes required in the network to support Instantaneous Licensing interactions.
- Communication about changes of LCSs and HCSs between operator and Ericsson.
- Support procedures for alarms or errors. Note: In some cases, such as emergency unlocks, return of licenses, and for unsupported products or standards, license keys must be requested manually.

Impact on Responsible Roles in the Organization

Analyze and identify the responsible roles in the organization for the following

areas:

- Software Asset Management and IL Manager
- Customer Access &amp; Security-Customer (CAS-C)
- Support procedures

## 2.4 Create Solution Deployment Plan

The goal of this task is to create a deployment plan for Instantaneous

Licensing.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

The connected mode Instantaneous Licensing deployment plan is created based on the

findings in the Technical Impact Analysis and the

Operational Impact Analysis. The deployment

plan includes the following:

- Tasks to be performed and timing.
- Resources required to secure the necessary operational and technical preparation.
- Phasing and timing for deployment, including lab trials, limited field trials, and full deployment.

# 3 Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Solution Design

The required HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) and License Configuration Sets (LCSs) are

created and network configurations are prepared.

The goal of this task is to design a commercial strategy for the Instantaneous Licensing

solution in the radio network.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

## 3.1 Create HCSs and LCSs for the Radio Network

The goal of this task is to create the required HWAC Configuration Set (HCSs) and

License Configuration Sets (LCSs) for affected nodes.

The HCSs and LCSs are created based on the findings in the Technical Impact

Analysis created in Technical Impact

Analysis.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

### 3.1.1 Define HWAC Configuration Sets

All HWAC configurations for an EUFT can be managed within one Baseband-HCS, but it might

lead to an overconsumption of entitlements. It is recommended that the configuration of

HCSs is balanced between having fewer HCSs, and minimizing overconsumption.

Configuration also depends on the type of commercial agreement in place. The following

aspects must be considered:

- Product types used in the network, for example Baseband 5216 and Baseband 6630
- Mix of RATs on a product, for example Baseband 6630 LTE, Baseband 6630 NR, and nodes with both LTE and NR.
- Separate pricing model or different default capacity on a product. For example, Baseband 6630 LTE ABW and Baseband 6630 LTE ABW + Massive MIMO might require a separate HCS.Note: Mixed ABW and Massive MIMO pricing models can coexist.

### 3.1.2 Define HWAC Configuration Set Details

Based on the HWAC Configuration Set (HCS), the common and variable parts for each HCS

must be defined as follows:

| Common part   |    | Defines the set of HWACs that is activated on a given Baseband unit and                             given RAT. The common part can contain several HWACs of any                             capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Variable part |    | Defines which HUP size is activated on the request of the node. The                             variable part specifies which HUP is used to fill the gap between the                             level that is activated from the initial package and the common part of                             Baseband HCS, and the level that the node requests. Multiple HUPs can be                             specified for a given Baseband type and given RAT. This results in a HUP                             set with the lowest overall cost. This configuration is recommended, as                             it allows network management through a single HCS. |

### 3.1.3 Define License Configuration Sets

Based on the node configuration in the radio network, the required License Configuration

Sets (LCSs) must be defined as follows:

- The goal is to define a single LCS to manage all nodes in the network. The use of multiple LCSs might cause problems if the wrong LCS is selected during node integration or migration to Instantaneous Licensing. In addition, migration between several LCSs is not a fully automated procedure and manual handling is required for license return.
- Fewer LCSs are required in the following cases: Different Baseband HCSs are defined A fixed quantity is set for licenses or HWACs Various fixed values are required because of node configuration

### 3.1.4 Define Special Activation Rules

Determine if special activation rules are required based on the node configuration in the

radio network. The following aspects must be considered:

- It is recommended to avoid the use of special activation rules to maintain simplicity within the deployment.
- If required by contract, it is possible to activate selected HWACs with a defined quantity based on the RAN Compute Unit connected to the radio node. This setting is applicable for all nodes managed by Instantaneous Licensing.
- If necessary within the Instantaneous Licensing solution, new special activation rules must be requested manually. Operators might request rules, such as the activation of licenses and HWACs in advance to avoid licensing issues during expansion.

It is recommended to document all defined LCSs and HCSs in a Licensing

Configuration Definition report, which can later be shared with the

operator.

## 3.2 Create Network Configuration

The goal of this task is to create the configuration and data needed to integrate

Customer Access &amp; Security-Customer (CAS-C) in the operator network and to enable

communication between ENM and radio nodes.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

Network Configuration for Connectivity between CAS-C and ENM

To ensure the connectivity between CAS-C and ENM, all values of the configurable

parameters described in the Configuration Management Service section of

the ENM Configuration System Administrator Guide must be

determined.

Communication between the CAS-C Proxy and ENM is done through REpresentational State

Transfer (REST) using HTTPS protocols with mutual authentication. The network

configuration must reflect the selected mutual authentication scheme based on the

Technical Solution Impact Analysis report created in Technical Impact Analysis.

Communication routes and firewall settings to support Instantaneous Licensing-related

communication between the radio nodes and ENM in the operator network must be

configured. The task involves a discussion with network customer engineer to define

the following parameters:

- Enable Instantaneous Licensing-related communication from ENM to the radio nodes through the definition of the following elements: ENM IP Radio node IP Radio node port TCP HTTPS
- Enable Instantaneous Licensing-related communication from the radio nodes to ENM through the definition of the following elements: Radio node IP ENM IP ENM port TCP HTTPS

Network Configuration for Connectivity between ENM and RAN

HTTPS is used for the communication between ENM (server) and the radio nodes

(clients). On the RAN side, the RAN OAM IP address and the fixed port number are

used for establishing the HTTPS connection for the Instantaneous Licensing solution.

This fixed port number is described in Transport Protocol Port Numbers for Node Hardening. On

the ENM side, the ENM server IP address and the assigned port for Instantaneous

Licensing are included in the activate message when ENM initiates

the set up of the HTTPS connection to the RAN.

It is recommended to document all defined configurations in a Network

Configuration Definition report, which can later be shared with the

operator.

# 4 Order Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Solution

The goal of this task is to order the required access rights and configure the required

data for Instantaneous Licensing migration.

## 4.3 ELIS Preparation

The goal of this task is to prepare the data in Ericsson License System (ELIS) for

the deployment of the Instantaneous Licensing solution.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

Based on the Technical Solution Impact Analysis, the Customer Unit performs

the following tasks:

1. Manually orders LKFs at the license key expiration date if the Term-Based Licensing (TBL) payment model is chosen. The Instantaneous Licensing solution does not update the end dates of license keys and a manual request is required to extend them.
2. Ensures that the entitlements stock in Ericsson Electronic Licensing Solution (ELIS) reflects the License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) definitions defined in the Licensing Configuration Definition report. If there is a shortage, additional items must be ordered.
3. Returns fingerprints with entitlements activated in more than one EUFT group if the radio nodes are manually connected to a single operator EUFT.
4. For all identified fingerprints that have wrongly activated licenses or have licenses not compliant with LCS and HCS definitions, clean-up in ELIS must be done. Instantaneous Licensing supports an optional method to sort out such problems automatically by performing LKF clean-up at migration to Instantaneous Licensing.

5. Enable the Instantaneous Licensing service in ENM by following the procedure described in the Enable the Instantaneous License Feature for Polling LKF files section in ENM Configuration System Administrator Guide.

## 5.3 Initialize SAM

The goal of this task is to configure Software Asset Management (SAM) for

Instantaneous Licensing.

The Customer Unit is responsible for this task.

The configuration procedure consists of the following steps:

1. Configuring the operator EUFT and the receiver of SAM and Instantaneous Licensing notifications using the Technical Solution Impact Analysis report created in Technical Impact Analysis and the Operation Solution Deployment Analysis report created in Operational Impact Analysis.
2. Creating or modifying required HWAC Configuration Set (HCSs) in IL Manager using the Licensing Configuration Definition report created in Define Special Activation Rules.
3. Creating or modifying required License Configuration Sets (LCSs) in IL Manager using the Licensing Configuration Definition report created in Define Special Activation Rules.
4. Updating the Licensing Configuration Definition document with the LCS IDs by creating or deleting activation rules in IL Manager. Note: The pre-sales support engineer is responsible for the coherence of the defined rules.
5. Updating the Licensing Configuration Definition document with the LCS IDs. Note: This document is shared with the operator for support procedures.

## 5.4 Migrate Baseband Radio Node with Selected Licensing Strategy

After the migration process is completed, the final steps ensure that Instantaneous

Licensing operates according to project specifications.

The goal of this task is to migrate existing radio nodes in a radio network to the

Instantaneous Licensing solution and to allocate them to a specific licensing

strategy.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

The following options are available:

- Migration in IL Manager
- Migration in the Radio Node
- Migration with ELIS clean-up
- Migration to another LCS

### 5.4.1 Migration in IL Manager

Steps

The following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:

1. Create a list of fingerprints and License Configuration Set (LCS) IDs for the radio nodes that are intended to be controlled by Instantaneous Licensing. The list is created together with the operator.
2. Migrate one or multiple hardware resources from the list to Instantaneous Licensing using one of the following methods: A hardware resource is migrated individually from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Single Migration option. Multiple hardware resources are migrated in batch from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Batch Migration option. A Migration File Template can be downloaded and used for batch migrations.
3. Verify the status of the hardware resources by using the Request Status option. Note: A status report can be downloaded as an Excel sheet.

The following steps are performed by the operator:

4. Confirm Software Asset Management (SAM) and Instantaneous Licensing readiness.
5. Activate Instantaneous Licensing on target radio nodes by doing the following:
    1. Set the value of the InstantaneousLicensing.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.
    2. Perform a Refresh operation on the target radio node.

Results

The Instantaneous Licensing compliant LKF for the target radio node is installed. The

progress of the submitted request can be tracked by checking the progress report in

the Instantaneous Licensing MOM. For more information about detailed operations, see

Instantaneous Licensing Solution Guideline.

### 5.4.2 Migration in the Radio Node

Steps

The following steps must be performed by

Customer

Engineer.

1. Follow the instructions in the Instantaneous Licensing feature description.
2. Set the InstantaneousLicensing.euft and the InstantaneousLicensing.swltId attributes manually on the node if the node is not migrated to LCS in IL Manager. The swltId is an equivalent of the LCS ID.
3. Ensure that the NodeCredential and the TrustCategory MO classes are created and configured correctly.
4. Ensure that the ENodeBFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget and the GNBDUFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget attributes for LTE and NR are set if the throughput price model is used. These attributes are used for calculation of the required number of Baseband HWACs.
5. Change the operationalState in the configuration for Instantaneous Licensing to UNLOCKED by using ENM CLI. Note: If a non-connected Instantaneous Licensing LKF is installed on radio node, the License System Triggered Unlock Unavailable alarm is raised because Instantaneous Licensing Perpetual for RAN (CXC4012700) is missing. The alarm is ceased when the LKF is installed in Step 6. And the CXC4012700 license does not need to be activated because only the presence of this key in LKF is checked by the radio node. The operationalState attribute of Instantaneous Licensing is supposed to be used to administratively activate or deactivate the Instantaneous Licensing feature.
6. Request a new LKF for the node. For more information, see License Refresh in Manage License and Hardware Activation Code. Note: The InstantaneousLicensing.swltId attribute cannot be changed manually once the Instantaneous Licensing feature is enabled on the node.

### 5.4.3 Migration with ELIS Clean-Up

The goal of this task is to perform automated LKF clean-up activity at migration to

Instantaneous Licensing.

The Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.

Steps

The following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:

1. Create a list of fingerprints and License Configuration Set (LCS) IDs for the radio nodes that are intended to be controlled by the Instantaneous Licensing feature. The list is created together with the operator.
2. Create a list of fingerprints that are the subject of the ELIS clean-up during migration to Instantaneous Licensing. The list is created together with the operator.
3. Migrate one or multiple hardware resources from the list to Instantaneous Licensing using one of the following methods: A hardware resource is migrated individually from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Single Migration option. Multiple hardware resources are migrated in batch from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Batch Migration option. A Migration File Template can be downloaded and used for batch migrations.
4. Verify the status of the hardware resources by using the Request Status option. Note: A status report can be downloaded as an Excel sheet.
5. Configure the LKF clean-up exemption in IL Manager by providing a list of fingerprints which are to be cleaned up. If all fingerprints in the network require clean-up, the exemption must be set at the EUFT level.

The following steps are performed by the operator:

6. Confirm Software Asset Management (SAM) and Instantaneous Licensing readiness.
7. Activate Instantaneous Licensing on target radio nodes by doing the following:
    1. Set the value of the InstantaneousLicensing.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.
    2. Perform a Refresh operation on the target radio node with the licenseDemandContent parameter set to FULL\_DEMAND. This can be achieved in one of the following ways: Run the following ENM CLI command: cmedit action SubNetwork=&lt;SubNetwork Name&gt;,MeContext=&lt;MeContext Name&gt;,ManagedElement=&lt;NetworkElementName&gt;,NodeSupport=1,LicenseSupport=1,InstantaneousLicensing=1 refreshKeyFile. (licenseDemandContent=FULL\_DEMAND) Perform the InstantaneousLicensing.refreshKeyFile MO action with the licenseDemandContent parameter set to FULL\_DEMAND directly on the radio node.

Results

If the ELIS clean-up is done, the new LKF exactly matches the Radio Node

configuration, LCS, and HCS, and then the new LKF is installed on the target node.

The progress of the submitted request can be tracked by checking the progress report

in the InstantaneousLicensing MO. For more information on the

detailed operations, see Instantaneous Licensing Solution Guideline.

### 5.4.4 Migration to Another LCS

This task involves activities, some of which are performed on the radio node by

Customer

Engineer and some are performed in IL Manager by the Customer

Unit. These steps need to be coordinated throughout the following flow.

Steps

The following step is performed by the Customer Unit:

1. Optional: Set the value of the InstantaneousLicensing.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED on the radio node.

The following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:

2. Disconnect the radio node from the LCS by using the HW Resources to LCS section in the IL Manager. For more information, see IL Manager User Guide.
3. Submit an ELAS support ticket for a manual clean-up in ELIS if required. Wait until a new LKF is generated.
4. Connect the radio node to the LCS by using the HW Resources to LCS section in the IL Manager.

The following steps are performed by Customer Engineer:

5. Optional: Set the ENodeBFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget and the GNBDUFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget attributes if a radio node is migrated to LCS with the throughput price model.
6. Optional: Set the InstantaneousLicensing.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED to enable Instantaneous Licensing on the node.
7. Request a new LKF for the node. For more information, see License Refresh in Manage License and Hardware Activation Code. The previous LCS identity in the InstantaneousLicensing.swltId attribute is overwritten with the new identity after the LKF request. Note: The InstantaneousLicensing.swltId attribute cannot be changed manually once Instantaneous Licensing is enabled on the node. This procedure is valid for migrating a node to another LCS using the same price model in LCSs. Step 1 and Step 5 are optional and can be skipped if it is confirmed that no LKF request is triggered from the node during the execution of step 2-4. Step 2 cannot be performed when only the Integration LKF is created. An ELAS ticket for manual support must be created to return license resources and disable a node in ELIS. When this is completed, an Integration LKF can be recreated.

Results

The result of Migration to LCS in IL Manager is a new LKF or a set of LKFs which must

be provided to the Customer Engineer.

When the Customer Engineer installs new LKFs on radio nodes, the values of EUFT and

swltId are automatically set by the system. If the NodeCredential

and the TrustCategory MO classes are created and configured

correctly, Customer Engineer sets the operationalState of

Instantaneous licensing to UNLOCKED. For more information, see

Instantaneous Licensing feature description.

# 6 Migrate from Non-Connected Mode to Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing

All tasks described in sections 2 to 5 must be completed before migration from

non-connected mode to connected mode Instantaneous Licensing can be performed.

Prerequisites

CAS-E and CAS-C connections are established and the ENM configuration is ready.

Steps

1. Set Connection Mode to Connected
2. Set Administrative State to Unlocked

# 7 Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Migration Troubleshooting

This troubleshooting section provides guidance if errors or alarms occur and

migration cannot be completed.

## 7.1 CAS Proxy

For CAS Proxy monitoring and troubleshooting, see CAS documentation.

## 7.2 ENM

Connectivity between ENM and CAS

The different troubleshooting cases that can occur in the connectivity between ENM

and CAS are described in the Troubleshoot the License Request Job

section in Configuration Troubleshooting Guide.

Fingerprint Uniqueness

ENM cannot ensure fingerprint uniqueness in all cases. The operator is responsible

for fingerprint uniqueness. If duplicate fingerprints exist in the network, LKF

generation in Electronic License Information System (ELIS) might fail.

## 7.3 Baseband Radio Node

Synchronization between ENM and the Radio Node

Check the synchronization status in the ENM Command Line

Interface by using command: cmedit get &lt;node name&gt; --

syncstatus

See the following example for correct

syntax::

```
>>cmedit get SELIITRBS01293 -- syncstatus
FDN : Subnetwork=NS_Cluster, MeContext= SELIITRBS01293 syncStatus : 
SYNCHRONIZED
```

If the node is not synchronized, troubleshoot the connection according to the

instructions in ENM Configuration Troubleshooting Guide.
