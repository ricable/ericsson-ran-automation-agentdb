# 1 Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing Overview

The feature provides a means of transmitting downlink data in unused resource elements

in symbols carrying NR PDSCH DMRS. This creates the opportunity for increased NR downlink

data throughput on a cell level.

Summary

The feature allows NR downlink data to be transmitted to a given UE in symbols carrying DMRS.

This is achieved by multiplexing PDSCH with DMRS, so that PDSCH replaces unused

resource elements in symbols carrying DMRS. Such multiplexing applies to every

resource block that is allocated for PDSCH in a given transmission.

The feature can realize the following benefits:

- Increased efficiency in NR resource element use
- Increased NR downlink throughput

Additional Information

# 2 Dependencies of Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

The feature is related to NR features used for different cell configurations and

mobility. Feature applicability is limited by cell configuration and the number of

transmission layers.

Hardware

This feature is not supported on AIR 3284.

Limitations

- The feature can only be used in cells with Low-Band (non-ESS) or Mid-Band configuration.
- The feature can only be enabled in the cell if the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute value is equal to or less than UP\_TO\_100KMPH.
- Multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS is not performed in TDD special slots that have only one DMRS symbol.
- Multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS can only be applied to 1- or 2-layer downlink transmissions. According to 3GPP, if the gNodeB and the UE support 3- or 4-layer transmissions, and the UE is in good radio conditions, 3- or 4-layer transmissions are used without the multiplexing of PDSCH with DMRS.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

The multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS excludes the possibility of DMRS power boost. The

throughput gains with the feature depend on channel conditions.

When PDSCH is multiplexed with DMRS, DMRS power boosting is not possible, as 3GPP states.

This means that a trade-off exists between DMRS power and gaining additional resource

elements for downlink data. This can have an impact on the ability of the UE to decode

PDSCH and on the overall channel estimation. However, when the gNodeB does not multiplex

PDSCH with DMRS, power boost is retained. In this case, the unused DMRS resource

elements are power-boosted, which improves DMRS reception. Consequently, the ability of

the UE to decode PDSCH also improves, especially at low SINR.

Figure 1   Resource Element Usage without and with PDSCH and DMRS Multiplexing

The NRCellDU.pdschAllowedInDmrsSym attribute is used to manually

enable or disable the multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS in individual NR cells. The

attribute can be enabled when the following criteria are met:

- The cell is configured as a Low-Band (non-ESS) or a Mid-Band cell.
- The Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature is activated on the gNodeB. The configured attribute value is checked together with the Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature license. If the attribute is set to true and the feature license is not installed, not activated, or expired (the FeatureState.serviceState attribute is set to INOPERABLE), the NR cell has the following attribute values when unlocked: NRCellDU.availabilityStatus is set to FAILED. NRCellDU.operationalState is set to DISABLED. NRCellDU.serviceState is set to OUT\_OF\_SERVICE. In addition, the following alarms are raised on the NR cell: The MO Configuration Requires Key Install and Feature Activation alarm is raised when the feature license is not installed. The Configuration Requires Feature Activation alarm is raised when the feature is not activated or expired.

Throughput gains with the feature are expected when the PDSCH is multiplexed with DMRS

for a given PDSCH transmission to a given UE in good SINR conditions. To prevent

downlink throughput degradation for the UE in the cell where such multiplexing is

enabled, the following means are provided:

- The gNodeB does not multiplex PDSCH with DMRS for a given PDSCH transmission when the gNodeB-estimated SINR in the cell is below a configured threshold. This threshold can be tuned by using the NRCellDU.dlDmrsMuxSinrThresh attribute. The attribute value applies to the individual cell. The gNodeB uses this threshold value to decide whether or not to multiplex PDSCH with DMRS for a given PDSCH transmission.
- If activating the feature degrades throughput, and the SINR threshold cannot be tuned properly, the operator can manually disable the multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS in that given cell by setting the NRCellDU.pdschAllowedInDmrsSym attribute to false.

# 4 Network Impact of Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

The feature creates the opportunity for an increased number of PDSCH resource

elements and for an increase in downlink data throughput.

Capacity and Performance

When PDSCH is multiplexed with DMRS, the number of resource elements available for

data increases. The percentage increase of possible PDSCH resource elements can be

calculated as 12 / (11 Ã— 12). 12 in the numerator

stands for two PDSCH symbols with DMRS multiplied by six PDSCH subcarriers. The

denominator has 11 PDSCH symbols with no DMRS multiplied by 12 subcarriers. The

increase in the number of PDSCH resource elements, however, does not represent the

same increase in NR downlink throughput.

Both the increased number of PDSCH resource elements and the actual NR downlink

throughput gain are expected to vary mainly because of the following conditions:

- Low SINR or the UE located close to the cell edge.
- The number of downlink transmission layers used in the network. According to 3GPP, multiplexing of PDSCH with DMRS is only possible when 1- or 2-layer transmissions are used. No gains can be expected where the majority of UEs use three or four layers for downlink transmission.

As 3GPP states, DMRS power boosting is not possible when PDSCH is multiplexed with

DMRS. This means that a trade-off exists between DMRS power and gaining additional

resource elements for downlink data. This can have an impact on the ability of the

UE to decode PDSCH and on the overall channel estimation.

The benefit provided by the feature can be observed when using KPIs representing data

throughput. The recommended KPI for monitoring the throughput gain is Normalized

Average DL MAC Cell Throughput Considering Traffic.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.3 or later is recommended for this feature.

| Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput Considering Traffic | This KPI is recommended to observe the throughput increase when                                     the Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature is activated.                                     The KPI captures the data volume increase in downlink for the                                     served UE in the given cell.  For sustained traffic, this KPI shows an increase because of the                                     increased amount of data in downlink transmission.  For traffic occurring in bursts, the KPI might show an increase                                     because of the increased amount of data and the decreased time                                     for PDSCH scheduling.  In cells with low volume of traffic, the KPI might not show any                                     increase at all. |

The following KPIs can also be observed to monitor the gain with the feature:

- Common NR KPIs for both EN-DC and NR SA cell configurations: Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput Considering Actual PDSCH Slot Only Average DL MAC DRB Throughput DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS
- KPIs for only EN-DC cell configuration: Differentiated Average DL PDCP UE Throughput Captured in eNodeB Differentiated Average DL PDCP UE Throughput for LTE Leg Using Carrier Aggregation, Captured in eNodeB Differentiated Average DL PDCP UE DRB Throughput Captured in eNodeB

RIs

The following RIs can also be observed to monitor the gain with the feature:

- Average DL MAC Throughput per NRCellDU

Counters

The feature introduces the NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedNrEfficiency PM

counter to directly observe the extent to which the feature is used. The PM counter

shows the number of PDSCH resource elements that are allocated in DMRS symbols

divided by the number of subcarriers in one symbol.

After feature activation, the values of the following groups of PM counters might

change as described below:

- The following PM counters increase by the amount of additional MAC volume that can be transmitted because of the feature: NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCell NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCell The amount these PM counters are increased is highly dependent on traffic conditions.Note: The following counter can be used to monitor the increased number of PDSCH resource elements in EN-DC cell configuration: EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb
- The following PM counters decrease in value proportional to the amount with which the feature is able to shorten the time required to complete the transmission of a downlink data burst: NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrb NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbLastSlot NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbLastSlotSamp NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrbSamp The amount these PM counters are decreased, if at all, is highly dependent on traffic conditions.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing

## 9.1 SINR Threshold Configuration to Avoid Throughput Degradation

When tuning the SINR threshold for the Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature,

radio conditions in the cell must be considered.

When Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature is activated on the gNodeB and enabled

in individual Low-Band and Mid-Band cells, downlink throughput gains depend on channel

conditions. The CQI counters, for example, can be used to monitor the channel

conditions. The gNodeB evaluates the channel conditions by SINR estimation and compares

this estimated SINR to a threshold value that can be configured on cell level. If the

estimated SINR is below this configured threshold, the gNodeB does not multiplex PDSCH

with DMRS for a given PDSCH transmission to avoid throughput degradation.

The threshold value can be set and tuned by using the

NRCellDU.dlDmrsMuxSinrThresh attribute. The attribute value

applies to the individual cell.

The optimal SINR threshold value depends on factors that can vary from cell to cell. For

example, channel conditions, traffic characteristics, and the distribution of the UEs

within the cell.

When the feature is enabled in a cell with the default threshold value set in the

NRCellDU.dlDmrsMuxSinrThresh attribute, the NR KPIs representing

data throughput need to be monitored. If no performance gain can be observed in the cell

with the default threshold value, the attribute needs to be tuned until the data

throughput KPIs show performance gain.

Throughput gain reduction might also occur at high SINR when the feature is activated and

enabled in a cell. This is because SINR is reduced in the cell for users scheduled with

higher modulation schemes (64QAM, 256QAM) with power back-off. In this case, the SINR

threshold might need to be tuned to mitigate the reduction in throughput gain.

## 9.2 Enable or Disable the Multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS Manually

The operator can manually enable or disable the multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS on a

cell level when the Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature is activated.

The NRCellDU.pdschAllowedInDmrsSym attribute is used to enable or

disable the multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS manually in individual cells.

Prerequisites

The Downlink Data and DMRS Multiplexing feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.pdschAllowedInDmrsSym to true in the NR cell in which the multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS is to be enabled.

If activating the feature leads to throughput degradation in the cell, and the

SINR threshold cannot be tuned properly, the multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS can

be disabled manually. To prevent downlink throughput degradation in a given

cell:

2. Set the NRCellDU.pdschAllowedInDmrsSym to false in the cell. Result: The multiplexing of PDSCH and DMRS is not applied in the cell.
