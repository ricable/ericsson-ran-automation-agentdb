Summary

The High Speed UE feature supports UE speeds up to 350 km/h in cells with the highest carrier

frequencies in the E-UTRA operating bands. This establishes and maintains

connections to UEs with frequency offsets up to 1900 Hz.

In cells with a high carrier frequency, a fast-moving UE causes high-frequency offsets in the

signal that the cell receives. This is caused by the Doppler effect. When a UE moves

towards or moves away from the eNodeB, the Doppler effect causes a quick change in

the frequency offset. The High Speed UE feature estimates and tracks frequency

offsets that are large, change fast or both. It also compensates for the offsets in

the cell. This makes it possible to support UE speeds of 350 km/h for the highest

carrier frequencies.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The maximum cell range cannot exceed 33 km.

Network Requirements

To ensure that the feature works properly, the following prerequisites are

necessary:

- Each UE that goes in sync must have the CQI resource on PUCCH allocated.
- The EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence attribute is selected so that all preambles are generated from that root sequence and a set of subsequent root sequences. For more information about rachRootSequence settings, see Deployment Guideline.
- There must be enough PUCCH CQI resources for all RRC connected UE. This can be set by the EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers or the EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers attribute. It is monitored by the EUtranCellFDD.pmPucchSrCqiResCongCqi or the EUtranCellTDD.pmPucchSrCqiResCongCqi attribute, and the BbProcessingResource.pmPucchCqiResCongBbm attribute.

# 3 Feature Operation of High Speed UE

The High Speed UE feature makes a restricted set of cyclic shifts on PRACH to estimate

frequency offset.

Operational Process

For a UE moving at high speed with high carrier frequency, the frequency offset

estimates based on PUSCH and PUCCH are subject to ambiguities and cannot be

correctly estimated. High-frequency offset impact on PRACH also causes problems.

This is resolved by comparing the frequency offset estimates on PUSCH, PUCCH and

PRACH.

This feature implements the following:

- Restricted set of cyclic shifts on PRACH, which is configured on cell level by setting the EUtranCellFDD.highSpeedUEActive or the EUtranCellTDD.highSpeedUEActive attribute to true. A restricted set of cyclic shifts makes it possible to estimate frequency offset on PRACH. The configuration of the EUtranCellFDD.highSpeedUEActive or the EUtranCellTDD.highSpeedUEActive attribute is signaled to the UE by the highSpeedFlag information element in the RRC message System Information Block 2.
- Extended detection intervals on PRACH. It handles the effects of high-frequency offset which results in the following in a matched filter: Reduction in main peak. Appearance of additional peaks.
- Frequency offset estimation on PRACH.
- Frequency offset estimation and compensation on PUCCH.
- Frequency offset estimation and compensation on PUSCH.
- Frequency offset ambiguity resolution on PUSCH and PUCCH.
- Modification of uplink and downlink scheduler so that the transmission of PUCCH format 2 is not replaced by format 1A/1B or PUSCH. To maintain an at least 1000-Hz connection at high Doppler, the eNodeB must be sure that the UE transmits the periodic CQI PUCCH format 2 at every occasion. As PUCCH format 2 periodicity is 80 ms, the DRX cycle must be set to maximum 80 ms, to ensure the eNodeB receives the PUCCH format 2 (periodic CQI) periodically every 80 ms.

The restricted set of cyclic shifts on PRACH ensures that the PRACH detector at high

Doppler shifts works properly. This makes it possible to estimate the frequency

offset on PRACH.

Figure 1   Ambiguity Resolution for Frequency Offset Estimates on PUSCH and

PUCCH

The benefit of the feature depends on the UE speed in relation to the base station

and the corresponding frequency spectrum. The typical frequency spectrum and UE

speed relation is shown in Table 2.

Table 2   UE Speed and Typical Frequency Spectrum Relation for Feature

Benefit

| UE Speed   | Frequency Spectrum   |
|------------|----------------------|
| >100 km/h  | 3500 MHz             |
| >150 km/h  | 2600 MHz             |
| >200 km/h  | 2100 MHz             |
| >250 km/h  | 1800 MHz             |

# 4 Network Impact of High Speed UE

The High Speed UE feature affects network throughput and coverage.

Capacity and Performance

The benefit of the feature can be realized, if the UEs move at high speed. The UE

high speed for the typical frequency spectrum is described in Table 2.

Peak throughput might be slightly reduced because of scheduling restrictions. The

uplink and downlink scheduler avoids uplink grants and downlink assignments that

cause drop of PUCCH format 2 transmissions by PUSCH or the Hybrid Automatic Repeat

Request Acknowledge (HARQ-ACK) message in PUCCH format 1A/1B.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

If there is high CQI periodicity, the High Speed UE feature might affect the packet

loss rate of non-high-speed UEs, which are on the same cell with the high-speed UEs.

This impact can be mitigated by the setting of CQI periodicity to be lower than

configured for the feature.

# 5 Parameters for High Speed UE

The feature introduces attributes to activate the High Speed UE feature on cell

level.

Table 3   Parameters

| Parameter                       | Type       | Description          |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.highSpeedUEActive | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| EUtranCellTDD.highSpeedUEActive | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of High Speed UE

The High Speed UE feature might affect KPIs related to accessibility, retainability,

mobility, and throughput for high-speed UEs.

KPIs

The feature has a positive impact on KPIs related to accessibility, retainability,

mobility, and throughput for high-speed UEs at high speed in the typical frequency

spectrum. However, if the percentage of high-speed UEs is small, changes in KPIs

might be difficult to observe since they aggregate data for all UEs. In such case,

active testing is required to evaluate the gain.

Counters

The following counters might show the impact of the feature:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktLostUlQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktLostUlQci
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktReceivedUlQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktReceivedUlQci

Events

This feature has no associated events.
