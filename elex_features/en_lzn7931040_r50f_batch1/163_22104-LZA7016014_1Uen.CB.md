Hardware

The following radio types are not supported with Higher Order Modulation including

MCS 256-QAM, and keep radio performance mode in default mode:

- RRUS 31
- RRU 22F1
- RRU 22F2
- RRU 22F3
- RRUL 11
- RRUL 62
- RRUL 81
- RRUL 82
- RRUS 82

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, UE must be 3GPP release 12 or later, to support

256-QAM modulation.

This feature is supported in the following transmission modes:

- TM1
- TM2
- TM3 On AAS, only TDD is supported.
- TM4 On AAS, only FDD is supported.
- TM7 with SU-MIMO Only supported on AAS TDD.
- TM8 with SU-MIMO Only supported on AAS TDD.
- TM8 with MU-MIMO Only supported on SRS-based AAS TDD, with maximum 8 layers.
- TM9

The feature can be supported in mixed mode, but then throughput can be affected.

# 3 Feature Operation of 256-QAM Downlink

The scheduler dynamically selects modulation scheme based on downlink quality. To

achieve full 256-QAM peak speed, the radio must be configured for sufficient power

headroom.

The 256-QAM Downlink feature supports dynamic switching between two modes:

The feature uses reports from the radio to perform the following:

- Confirm if the feature is supported by the hardware.
- Indicate if the maximum performance can be provided for the configured output power level.

The user data rate is not affected for UEs that are not capable of 256-QAM. Data rate is not

affected for UEs capable of 256-QAM in legacy mode also.

## 3.1 Coverage and Capacity of 256-QAM Downlink

In live networks, 256-QAM can be used even without power backoff, but on a best-effort level.

When the downlink link quality is good enough, the system performs dynamic switching between

legacy modulation mode and HOM mode. To observe gain for 256-QAM, the radio environment must

be good.

Link adaptation selects 256-QAM when the UE is in HOM mode and the link quality is good enough to use 256-QAM. The transition between legacy and HOM mode occurs when the SINR value is high enough.

The LTE scheduler HOM increases the user throughput for a given link quality compared to the

legacy scheduler. This means that user throughput also increases for MCS 64-QAM, not only for

MCS 256-QAM.

Channel conditions have an impact on observed gain, for example that line-of-sight conditions

give better gain compared to non-line-of-sight conditions. UE speed has low impact on the

performance, if the radio conditions are good.

Figure 1   Cell Divided in Regions with Legacy Mode, HOM Mode, and HOM Mode and 256-QAM Peak

Throughput

A cell can be divided into regions. The region with HOM mode and 256-QAM peak throughput is

the part of the cell where radio conditions are sufficient to achieve 256-QAM downlink peak

performance. The region marked with HOM mode indicates a larger area where radio conditions

are sufficient enough that it is possible to switch to HOM mode. In this area users benefit

from the new scheduler, although peak performance is not always achieved. The region with

legacy mode is the part of the cell where radio conditions are suitable for legacy mode.

The size the regions depend on transmit link quality and UE measured Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

In indoor cell coverage cells with low interference the regions can overlap completely.

# 4 Network Impact of 256-QAM Downlink

Downlink throughtput can be increased with the 256-QAM Downlink feature.

Capacity and Performance

The 256-QAM Downlink feature is a 3GPP-compliant modulation that increases downlink

throughput by up to 30%.

The feature enables more efficient use of the spectrum allocated to the cell.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

## 9.1 Deploy 256-QAM Downlink with Normal Macro Deployment

The feature only supports 256-QAM downlink after the recommended

deployment.

Steps

1. Perform normal macro deployment. The UEs in the cell benefit from new modulation when the traffic load is sufficiently below the maximum traffic power. No change of radio performance mode is needed.
2. Use indoor coverage, hotspot cells, and field trials (cells with good link quality in the whole cell area). To obtain optimal maximum performance for configured output power, set the SectorCarrier.radioTransmitPerfMode parameter to the desired operation mode. The performance of 256-QAM Downlink feature depends on the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the transmitter. Low EVM means increased throughput. To achieve a decreased EVM, the power headroom must increase. The power headroom is defined as the difference between the radio hardware capability, the SectorCarrier.maximumTransmissionPower parameter, and the SectorEquipmentFunction.configuredOutputPower parameter of the MO instance representing the radio unit. Some radio configurations require that the configured output power is reduced. The added minimum power headroom value requirement is 1.2 dB, 1.8 dB, or 2.3 dB. The minimum value depends on the radio unit type.

## 9.2 256-QAM Downlink HOM Scheduler Support

The MOM parameter dl256QamStatus can be used to check if the 256-QAM

Downlink feature and the HOM scheduler is supported or not:

| dl256QamStatus = SUPPORTED     |    | The 256-QAM feature is supported in the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| dl256QamStatus = NOT_SUPPORTED |    | The 256-QAM feature is not supported in the cell. The possible reasons                             are:  The 256-QAM feature license is not enabled or activated.     MOM parameter dl256QamEnabled is not set to                                         TRUE.     The radio does not support radio headroom reporting to the                                     Baseband unit. |

network elements:

- UE UE must be 3GPP release 12 or later, and UE category 11 or 12 to support 256-QAM modulation.

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q1: Optimizing Cell Coverage and Throughput of Radios

The enhancement updates the radio operation modes to optimize the cell coverage and

throughput.

| Feature Name:           | N/A                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | N/A                                |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Benefits

The configuration of the cell coverage and throughput modes ensures the efficient use

of the radio. The enhancement reduces headroom, which means less power consumption

for the radio units.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement provides settings for lower energy consumption of the configured

cell. This can be achieved by the COVERAGE\_GREEN and the CAPACITY\_GREEN throughput

modes.

Operation

The enhancement deprecates the

SectorCarrier.radioTransmitPerformanceMode attribute and

introduces the SectorCarrier.radioTransmitPerfMode attribute,

which selects the coverage and throughput mode of the radio.

The change between the old and the new mode is made automatically.

| Deprecated      | New      |
|-----------------|----------|
| DEFAULT         | COVERAGE |
| QAM_64_BOOST    | CAPACITY |
| QAM_256_BOOST   | CAPACITY |
| MAX_POWER_CLASS | CAPACITY |

Coverage is the new default mode, the performance of the radio does not change when

it is configured. The CAPACITY, the COVERAGE\_GREEN, and the CAPACITY\_GREEN

throughput modes must be set manually. The COVERAGE\_GREEN mode provides higher

output power with less power consumption, and the CAPACITY\_GREEN mode provides

improved signal quality with less power

consumption.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.1 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
