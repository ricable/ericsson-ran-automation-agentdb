Summary

A UE is using one cell as PCell and one or more other cells as SCells. The PCell has

both a downlink and an uplink component carrier. The SCells can have either downlink

and uplink, or only downlink component carriers, but not only uplink. A cell can be

PCell for some UEs and SCell for other UEs. The feature supports the transmission of

uplink data over both the PCell and the SCell when a UE has an activated SCell.

This feature has the following benefits:

- UE data transmission simultaneously on more than one carrier
- Up to doubled uplink UE throughput
- Increased average uplink UE throughput
- Increased application coverage for uplink-demanding services

Additional Information

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- Multiple Timing Alignment values are not supported. It is therefore recommended to only configure uplink carrier aggregation serving cell relations where the inter-antenna distance is less than 300 meters between a PCell and an SCell that are both configured with uplink and downlink.
- Uplink carrier aggregation is not supported for external cells.
- Intra-band non-contiguous uplink carrier aggregation is not supported.

Network Requirements

- To benefit from the feature, the network needs to be configured with band and bandwidth combinations allowing uplink carrier aggregation according to 3GPP TS 36.101, Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and reception.
- To benefit from the feature, the UE must support uplink carrier aggregation for the applicable band and bandwidth combinations.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature supports the transmission of uplink data over both the PCell and the SCell

when a UE has an activated SCell.

A UE is evaluated for carrier aggregation at initial attach, reestablishment, or incoming

handover. The cells to be configured as SCells are determined by the activated licenses for

the following features:

- Carrier Aggregation
- 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension
- 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension
- 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension
- 6CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension
- Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation
- Configurable SCell Priority
- Global SCell Evaluation
- Automatic SCell Management

The Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature supports configuring an SCell for uplink carrier

aggregation according to the characteristics listed in Table 2.

Table 2   SCell Configuration Support

SCell Configuration Failure

A cell cannot be configured as an SCell for uplink carrier aggregation for a UE if any of

the following conditions applies:

- The cell has the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute set to ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL.
- The cell has the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute set to AUTO and the EUtranCellRelation.asmSCellDlOnlyAllowed attribute set to DL\_ONLY.
- The cell is in a different node than the PCell for the UE.
- The cell is using another frame structure type (FDD, TDD) than the PCell for the UE.
- The cell is a combined cell with more than two sector cells. For more information on combined cells, see Combined Cell.
- The cell has the High-Speed UE feature activated.
- The cell is a downlink only cell.

Power Splitting

The total maximum output power of a UE is independent of the number of active uplink

component carriers. So the total maximum output power is split between the used component

carriers, and PUSCH transmission power is scaled down.

The available UE output power is divided between the component carriers based on the

relative radio conditions in each component carrier.

For uplink 64-QAM and 256-QAM, power splitting can be optimized by offsetting the value of

the EUtranCellFDD.pZeroNominalPusch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroNominalPusch attributes with the

EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa and the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa attributes.

Optimized power splitting can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa or the EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa attribute to value 0-12 on both

the PCell and the SCells. If the attribute is set to value 0-12 on one

carrier aggregating cell and set to another value on the other, optimized power splitting is

disabled.

The fallback policy from two component carriers to one component carrier

is configured through the EUtranCellFDD.ulCaFallbackPolicy or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCaFallbackPolicy attribute in the following way:

- If the value of the attribute is set to 0, the system falls back to a component carrier with the higher SINR value.
- If the value of the attribute is set to 1, the system falls back to a component carrier with the higher transmission capability.
- If the value of the attribute is set to 2, the system falls back to the PCell.

Power Scaling

In uplink power control of carrier aggregation, the eNodeB-required transmit power of the

UE might exceed the configured maximum output power of the UE. In this case, the UE scales

down the power on both component carriers with a scaling factor.

To enable power scaling and potentially increase the UE uplink throughput, set the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCaPowerScalingMode or the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCaPowerScalingMode attribute to a non-default

value.

Removing or Configuring the Uplink Aspect of an SCell

A threshold is introduced to prevent the configuration of the uplink aspect of an SCell in

the higher attenuation regions. Some UEs are unable to dedicate their maximum power to a

single carrier when two uplink carriers are configured. This can potentially degrade the

uplink power budget for such UEs, and lead to associated connection loss.

The threshold that triggers the removal or configuration of the uplink aspect of an SCell

is ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir.

The uplink aspect is removed when the RSRP falls below the following configured value:

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir -

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.hysteresisA1A2RsrpBidirectional

The uplink aspect is configured in addition to the downlink aspect when the RSRP is above

the following configured value:

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir +

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.hysteresisA1A2RsrpBidirectional

When the SCell is configured for uplink, the expected drop in uplink power on the PCell has

to be determined to calculate the recommended value of

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir.

A UE with A 5 MHz PCell (25 PRBs) and A 20 MHz SCell (100 PRBs) can experience a drop of

10 × log10(125/25)=7.0 dB. UEs can have

other values of uplink power loss.

It is recommended to set the value of the

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir attribute to the sum of

the power drop and the value of the

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrp attribute (both in dB and

dBm).

When the value of the ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir

attribute is less than the value of the

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrp attribute, the capability to

add or remove uplink carrier aggregation without removing downlink is disabled.

It is also possible to prevent uplink to be configured in an SCell. The feature that

triggers the removal or configuration of the uplink aspect of an SCell is VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation.

When the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is

activated and a voice bearer request is received, the SCell candidate list for the UE is

removed or modified. A voice bearer request can be received during the following

procedures:

- Initial context setup
- Incoming handover
- RRC connection re-establishment

When the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is

activated and a voice bearer request is received at E-RAB setup, the SCells are

deconfigured.

The removal, modification, or deconfiguration depends on the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute.

Configuring Uplink SCell at A6 Reception

At the reception of the A6 Measurement Report, the eNodeB compares the A6 RSRP and the

value of the ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir attribute to

determine whether an uplink component is configured on the target SCell.

Table 5   SCell Configuration-Based A6 Reception

| Source SCell Configuration                | Comparison Result                                                                                      | Target SCell Configuration                |

## 3.1 Dynamic SCell Activation and Deactivation

In addition to the activation and deactivation conditions applicable with DL

Carrier

Aggregation

features, an SCell can also be activated and deactivated based on buffer occupancy in the UE.

Activation and deactivation of an SCell in the UE is done at the same time for DL and UL.

For

operator-configurable

thresholds related to the activation and deactivation, see

Parameters for Uplink Carrier Aggregation.

## 3.2 Interactions with VoLTE

Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation

![Image](../images/172_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.DT/additional_3_CP.png)

![Image](../images/172_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.DT/additional_3_CP.png)

VoLTE transmissions are scheduled only on the PCell when VoLTE is used together with

the

Uplink

Carrier

Aggregation

and Enhanced PDCCH Link

Adaptation

features. No scheduling resources are allocated on the SCell when VoLTE is

scheduled.

VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation

If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled on Carrier

Aggregation by

setting sCellHandlingAtVolteCall to value

DECONF\_UL\_SUPPRESS\_DL\_SCELLS,

the following is

achieved:

- The UL component carriers in the SCell are deconfigured.
- Dynamic SCell selection is suppressed during a VoLTE call.

## 3.3 Interaction of Uplink Carrier Aggregation with TTI Bundling

3GPP

TS 36.331, Evolved

Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol

specification does not allow simultaneous RRC configuration of

the

Uplink Carrier Aggregation and TTI Bundling.

Switching from Uplink Carrier Aggregation to TTI Bundling

If

the

Uplink Carrier Aggregation

feature

is configured for the UE and the radio conditions trigger the UE to use

the

TTI

Bundling

feature, then TTI Bundling has priority over

Uplink

Carrier Aggregation.

When radio conditions trigger the UE to use TTI

Bundling,

the UE is configured to use

it

with an RRC Connection Reconfiguration message which does the

following:

- Deconfiguration of the SCell or SCells.
- Configuration of the SCell or SCells with DL and no UL.
- Configuration of the TTI Bundling in the PCell.

If the High Power UE feature is used, the following applies:

When switching to TTI Bundling mode during uplink carrier

aggregation, the value of the maximum allowed output power of the UE is passed to

the PCell. The maximum allowed output power of the UE is based on the type of

downlink carrier aggregation configuration and the UE power class on the PCell.

Switching from TTI Bundling to Uplink Carrier Aggregation

When TTI Bundling is to be deconfigured in the UE, and there is at least one configured

SCell that can be configured with

UL

for the UE, the following is done with one

RRC connection

reconfiguration

message:

- Deconfiguration of one or more SCells.
- Configuration of one or more SCells with DL and one SCell with UL. If more than one SCell is configured with UL, the eNodeB selects an SCell randomly.
- Deconfiguration of the use of TTI Bundling in the PCell.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature increases uplink throughput for the UEs while also increasing memory

consumption for the node.

Capacity and Performance

Carrier aggregation UEs consume more memory than non-carrier-aggregation UEs. The

memory consumed for each carrier of a carrier aggregation UE is equivalent to one

non-carrier-aggregation user. This means that a 2CC carrier aggregation UE increases

the count of RRC connected UEs by two, a 3CC carrier aggregation UE increases it by

three and so on.

The feature increases average uplink UE throughput by providing up to double uplink

throughput for each UE.

The configuration of power scaling for uplink carrier aggregation

improves PUSCH PRB utilization and increases uplink UE throughput in the cell,

except at the cell edge. At the cell edge, uplink UE throughput might decrease

slightly.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

Optimized Power Splitting

It is recommended to set the EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa or the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa attribute to a value between

0 and 3. The benefits of optimized power

splitting are most prominent when uplink 64-QAM is the highest modulation

configured.

This enhancement introduces PM counters and updates PM events to measure the causes of

SCell configuration and deconfiguration. For enhanced observability, these new counters

are on cell relation level instead of cell level, and therefore provided as OSS

counters.

A new RBS PM counter is added to measure how many times a UE triggers the additional CA

opportunity timer. This new counter is accumulated on the PCell.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following counters in the EUtranCellRelation MO class are

introduced:

## Appendix A.c: 19.Q4: Carrier Aggregation Measurement Handling Enhancement

This enhancement optimizes the SCell reselection at A6 measurement report. It also

introduces a PM counter to provide observability for the A1 measurement report on cell

level.

| Feature Name:           | Uplink Carrier Aggregation         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4425                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405                       |
| Node Type:              | DU Radio Node, Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The reception of A6 is enhanced to consider the

a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir and

hysteresisA1A2RsrpBidirectional values. This helps avoiding

unnecessary configuration and deconfiguration of uplink SCells at A6 reception.

The pmCaDeconfiguredLostCoverageNoA1 PM counter indicates the number

of SCell deconfigurations happening because of A1 measurement report time-out.

Capacity and Performance

The improved A6 measurement handling reduces RRC signaling for uplink SCell

configuration. This can improve SCell retainability and carrier aggregation

throughput.

Operation

The enhanced A6 measurement handling takes effect only when it is enabled to add or

remove uplink carrier aggregation without removing downlink. This happens when the

value of ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir is more

than the value of ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrp.

The pmCaDeconfiguredLostCoverageNoA1 RBS PM counter can be

observed when the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode

attribute is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION or

ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 19.4 or later is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q1: Optimized Power Splitting for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The power splitting algorithm of the Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature is made more

flexible.

| Feature Name           | Uplink Carrier Aggregation   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4425                 |

| Access Type            | LTE                          |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                    |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement optimizes the power splitting algorithm of the Uplink

Carrier Aggregation feature for all modulations. It improves UE power splitting

between two component carriers in the uplink.

The benefits of this feature enhancement are most prominent when uplink 64-QAM is the

highest modulation configured in the cell or the UE. This feature enhancement has

the following benefits:

- Increased UE throughput
- More efficient UE transmission power use

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement can increase the value of the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl

This feature enhancement can increase the value of the following KPIs:

- Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average UL PDCP UE Throughput

This feature enhancement can slightly increase the value of the uplink HARQ BLER. The

BLER value is expected to remain within the target range.

Operation

For uplink 64-QAM and 256-QAM, this feature enhancement introduces the following

attributes to control the maximum negative offset for the

EUtranCellFDD.pZeroNominalPusch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroNominalPusch attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa
- EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa

This feature enhancement is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa or the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa attribute to value

0-12 on both the PCell and the SCells. If the attributes are

set to value 0-12 on one carrier aggregating cell and set to

another  value on the other, the feature enhancement is disabled.

It is recommended to set the EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa or the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa attribute to a value between

0 and 3.

With this feature enhancement, the range of PUSCH power offset for 64-QAM is the

following:

- For FDD: -EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa, EUtranCellFDD.puschPwrOffset64qam
- For TDD: -EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa, EUtranCellTDD.puschPwrOffset64qam

With this feature enhancement, the range of PUSCH power offset for 256-QAM is the

following:

- For FDD: -EUtranCellFDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa, EUtranCellFDD.puschPwrOffset256qam
- For TDD: -EUtranCellTDD.pZeroOffsetUlCa, EUtranCellTDD.puschPwrOffset256qam

For other modulations, this feature enhancement does not affect the

EUtranCellFDD.pZeroNominalPusch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pZeroNominalPusch attributes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement does not support AAS-capable radio units.

Other Network Elements

It is required to use ENM version 23.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced

by this feature enhancement.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows for power scaling in different modes for the Uplink

Carrier Aggregation feature. The configuration of power scaling affects uplink

component carriers in the following way:

- Increased rate of scheduling two uplink component carriers for carrier aggregation
- Increased allocated PUSCH PRB resources for the component carriers

This feature enhancement also improves the fallback policy from two component

carriers to one component carrier in uplink carrier aggregation.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Increased PUSCH PRB utilization
- Increased uplink UE throughput

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement increases uplink UE throughput in the cell, except at the

cell edge. At the cell edge, uplink UE throughput might decrease slightly.

The benefits of this feature enhancement can be observed through the following PM

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaScheduledUlSum
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolUl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolUlSCell
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpTimeUl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpTimeUlCa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpVolUl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpVolUlCa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCaScheduledUlSum
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolUl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolUlSCell
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpTimeUl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpTimeUlCa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpVolUl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpVolUlCa

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCaPowerScalingMode and the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCaPowerScalingMode attributes to enable power

scaling for uplink carrier aggregation. Power scaling is enabled in the cell if the

attribute is set to a value different form the default value.

This feature enhancement introduces the

EUtranCellFDD.ulCaFallbackPolicy and the

EUtranCellTDD.ulCaFallbackPolicy attributes to configure the

fallback policy from two component carriers to one component carrier. Setting the

value of the attributes to 1 allows for fallback to a component

carrier with higher transmission capability.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 25.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
