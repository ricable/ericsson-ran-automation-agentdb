# 1 Operator Defined QCI Overview

The Operator Defined QCI feature allows operator-defined QCI profiles to be assigned to

bearers or service flows.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

This feature enables the operator to define and configure new QCIs in addition to the

existing standardized QCIs (0-9). This allows a more flexible differentiation between

bearers or service flows from a QoS perspective. The operator can define additional QCI

profiles associated with QCI values in the 10-255 range.

Feature Dependency Between Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk and Operator Defined

QCI

The predefined mission-critical QCI profiles use QCI values that are also available

for operator-defined QCI profiles through the Operator Defined QCI feature. The

usage of these QCI profiles is determined by the feature state of the

Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk and the Operator Defined QCI features:

- If none of the features are active, these QCI profiles are not used.
- If only the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is active, the predefined QCI profiles are used.
- If only the Operator Defined QCI feature is active, and there are operator-defined QCI profiles overlapping with the predefined mission-critical QCIs, the operator-defined QCI profiles are used.
- If both features are active, and there are operator-defined QCI profiles overlapping with the predefined mission-critical QCIs, the predefined QCI profiles are used.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Operator Defined QCI

This feature enables the operator to alter the QoS preferences of selected bearer

services, ensuring resource-allocation according to demand.

The UE requests a QCI profile during connection setup. Normally, if the requested QCI profile

is not available, a default QCI profile is used. If the requested QCI profile is not available

in the following messages during an ongoing S1 and X2 handover procedure, the requested QCI

profile is used:

- S1AP E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
- S1AP E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST

If a handover is initiated, the handover preparation message must include the initially

requested QCI profile, not the QCI value currently assigned to the bearer.

The UE can set up new bearers in the following cases:

- At connection setup
- At handover connection setup
- During connected mode

If one of the requested bearers has an operator-defined QCI profile, the requested QCI

value must have a corresponding QCI profile configured in the eNodeB.

The same conditions apply when a bearer QCI modification is requested and the new QCI has a

value in the range 10-255.

When the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is activated, and an operator-defined QCI

profile is configured with the same value as any of the predefined mission-critical QCI

profiles, the predefined QCI profile is used.

If the feature is not operable, or the requested QCI value has a corresponding QCI profile

configured on the eNodeB, the QCI profile is assigned to the respective bearer to be set up or

modified. The default QCI profile contains a collection of parameters that are applied to all

bearers. The QCI value associated to the default QCI profiles are 0-9.

# 4 Network Impact of Operator Defined QCI

This feature has no impact on network capacity, performance, interfaces, or other

network elements.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Operator Defined QCI

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011163 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Operator Defined QCI

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011163 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Operator Defined QCI

New QCI values must be defined in the relevant MO attribute first, according to

bearer-related parameters. A cell lock and unlock procedure must be performed to ensure the

configured operation of the system.

To set up bearers with operator-defined QCI values, the operator must create MO instances

with the QciProfileOperatorDefined.qci attribute. The number of QCI profile

instances that the operator is allowed to add is limited to 17.

All cells must be locked before the operator creates a

QciProfileOperatorDefined MO instance or removes a QCI profile. After the

creation of a QciProfileOperatorDefined MO instance or the removal of a QCI

profile, the cells must be unlocked to ensure proper system operation. Also, changing the

value of an existing attribute requires corresponding setting process that must be applied.

The parameters included in the QciProfileOperatorDefined MO class must be

configured according to the parameters in the QciProfilePredefined MO

class. For more information about the configuration of bearer-related parameters in these MOs,

see Manage Bearers and Services.

For more information about the configuration of the QCI-based measurement offsets in the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.measReportConfigParams attribute, see Service Triggered Mobility.
