Summary

Each router maintains a routing table that shows where to route IP packets, based on their

destination address. There are two basic methods for providing the information used in the

routing table:

- Static routing
- Dynamic routing

When using static routing, the administrator manually configures the route for each IP

prefix. If resilience is needed, the administrator must configure resilient routes manually,

and provide multiple static routes for the affected prefixes. This configuration can cause

routing loops, which must be avoided. When the network topology changes, manual

reconfiguration of static routes is necessary.

When using dynamic routing, the routing information is created and updated by a routing

protocol running on the router. When dynamic routing is used, the network automatically

adapts to changes in the network topology. This includes the breaking of links and the

introduction of new links and routers. Dynamic routing has the following main

advantages:

- Simple to configure on large networks.
- Dynamically chooses a different route if a link goes down.

Dynamic routing has the following disadvantage:

- Choosing the best route is left to the routing protocol, and not the network administrator.

# 3 Feature Operation of OSPFv2

OSPFv2 is an IGP that uses LSA to inform other routers of the state of the links of the

sender.

In a link-state routing protocol, each router distributes information about its interfaces

and neighbor relationships. The collection of the link states of individual routers forms a

database that describes the autonomous system topology. OSPFv2 routers accumulate link-state

information, and use the SPF algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each node. This forms

the basis for developing routing information for the specific autonomous system. In OSPFv2,

the autonomous system can be hierarchically organized by partitioning it into areas.

The following terms apply to OSPFv2 enabled networks:

| Autonomous system   |    | A group of routers, which exchange routing information by using a common routing               protocol under a common technical administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| OSPFv2 Area         |    | A set of networks and hosts within an autonomous system which are administratively               grouped. As the topology of the area is hidden from the rest of the network, routing               traffic within the autonomous system can be reduced. Area number 0 is called Backbone               Area and must exist in an OSPFv2 network. |

Every OSPFv2 router in the area constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, showing

the connections between the nodes. Each node calculates the best logical path from it to every

possible destination in the network. The collection of best paths forms the node routing

table.

Depending on the location of a router in the OSPFv2 hierarchy, the router can function in any

combination of the following roles:

| Internal router           |    | A router in which all directly connected networks belong to the same area.                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                           |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Designated router and BDR |    | On multi-access networks with more than one router, a designated router generates the               LSAs for the network. BDRs provide a fail-safe in case the designated router is not               operational. |
|                           |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ABR                       |    | A router that attaches to multiple areas.                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                           |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ASBR                      |    | An ASBR exchanges routing information with routers belonging to other autonomous               systems, and advertises external routing information throughout its local autonomous               system.          |

The OSPFv2 treats point-to-point interfaces and broadcast interfaces differently based on

neighbor adjacencies, link state information flooding, and protocol packet destination

addresses.

The node supports the following network types:

| Point-to-Point         |    | In this network type, no designated router, or BDR is elected. An example for this               type is an ethernet segment with only two routers.                        |
|------------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        |    |                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Broadcast Multi-access |    | In this network type, designated router, and BDR are elected. If the designated               router fails, then the BDR takes over. An example for this type is ethernet. |

One of the areas must be configured as the backbone area. The backbone

has an identity of 0 and must be contiguous. It contains all ABRs

and is responsible for distributing routing information to all other

non-backbone areas.

The OSPFv2 allows some areas to be configured as stub areas. A stub area cannot propagate

routes external to the autonomous system in which it resides. However, it can propagate the

following:

- a default route
- intra-area routes
- inter-area routes

A stub area relies on default routing to forward traffic addressed to external

destinations.

NSSAs are extensions of OSPFv2 stub areas. They preserve the properties of a stub area, while

allowing limited import of external routes from other routing domains.

The OSPFv2 uses hello packets to discover and maintain neighbor relationships. The DBD and

LSR packets are used to form the adjacencies.

MD5 authentication for the OSPFv2 protocol is supported. Two keys can be configured for each

interface, and depending on what keys other routers on the link are using, each outgoing

OSPFv2 packet is authenticated with one of the keys. If it is needed to duplicate the packet,

both of the keys must be authenticated. This is needed when not all routers on the broadcast

domain use the same key.

Two keys are supported to enable key exchange. During key exchange, first a new key is

introduced on all routers, and then the old key is deleted from the routers.

TN supports acting as an ASBR by redistributing both connected and static routes in a router

to the OSPFv2 domain.

If attracting traffic to the node for black hole routing is needed in a network design,

introduce a static route with higher administrative cost than the null route, and let the

static route to be redistributed by OSPFv2.

The OSPFv2 makes it possible to set which links are preferred for traffic by setting

different costs. Cost is set on the OSPFv2 interface.

The node supports administrative distance management for the following routers:

- Static
- Inter-area
- Intra-area
- External OSPFv2

The administrative distance specifies how a router determines the preference of route

source.

An OSPFv2 interface can operate in either normal or passive mode.

| Normal mode   |    | OSPFv2 sends and receives OPSFv2 packets, and advertises the IP subnet of the               interface.                                                    |
|---------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|               |    |                                                                                                                                                           |
| Passive mode  |    | OSPFv2 advertises the IP subnet of the interface, but does not send OSPFv2 packets,               and drops all OSPFv2 packets received on the interface. |

# 4 Network Impact of OSPFv2

The implementation of this feature has impact on the capacity and performance of the

network.

Capacity and Performance

If link failures occur, network convergence and failovers are, in most cases, longer

than when using static routes with BFD.

The OSPFv2 feature has an exponential backoff for recalculations. This is to protect

the router from OSPFv2 using excessive CPU resources. The minimum delay time is 50

ms and the maximum time is 15 s. This means that updates are done with a delay of up

to 15 s in an unstable network.

The OSPFv2 has no impact on latency or throughput in the network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of OSPFv2

The feature does not have associated KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate OSPFv2

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- All routers in the OSPFv2 area must have the same settings for several parameters. The parameters must be configured before the router can be a part of the autonomous system. This applies to the following MO classes and attributes: Area.ospfAreaId Stub (MO must exist if area is Stub) Nssa (MO must exist if area is NSSA)
- All routers on the same ethernet broadcast OSPFv2 domain must have the same settings for the following MO attributes: Interface.helloInterval Interface.routerDeadInterval Interface.networkType Interface.authenticationType InterfaceIPv4.mtu Md5.md5Key Md5.setPassword

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011649 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate OSPFv2

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011649 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for OSPFv2

Several OSPFv2 configuration parameters must be the same in multiple routers on the

network.

Troubleshooting

When troubleshooting OSPFv2, the show command can be used on a

Router or InterfaceIPv4 MO instance to

display the route table.

## 9.1 Route Availability

Monitoring of links to neighbor routers are always done using the Hello protocol of

OSPFv2.

The detection time of links to neighbor routers is a couple of seconds long. For higher

performance, OSPFv2 can be enabled to use BFD for monitoring, which can reduce the detection

times to subseconds. When BFD is enabled for OSPFv2, that BFD profile is used which is

referenced in the InterfaceIPv4.bfdProfile attribute.

To avoid route flapping because of unstable links, a routing hold-down timer is applied. When

the conditions for route availability are fulfilled, the hold-down timer is started. The route

selection process takes the route into account only when the hold-down timer has expired. The

first time an IP interface comes up after being created, the routing hold-down timer does not

apply.
