# 1 Prescheduling Overview

Prescheduling improves the end-user latency by reducing the air interface contribution

to the overall latency.

Summary

The Prescheduling feature minimizes the round-trip time. It gives PUSCH grants to UEs in

advance, that is, without receiving scheduling requests or buffer status

reports.

Prescheduling is used to improve user plane and initial control plane latencies. This

leads to the following enhanced areas:

- Clear improvement of the so-called speed tests, also called ping tests. Different versions of speed tests are commonly used by smartphone users to measure bandwidth quality.
- Reduced download time, especially for small downloads.
- Faster connection setup times.

# 2 Dependencies of Prescheduling

The Prescheduling feature has dependencies to a number of other features.

# 3 Feature Operation of Prescheduling

This section describes how the grant of  the Prescheduling feature affects the

connection setup time.

Figure 1 shows the MOM parameters and how

they control the Prescheduling feature. A grant with the size set to

PreschedProfile.preschedulingDataSize or

PreschedulingProfile.preschedulingDataSize is sent to a UE at the end of

every PreschedProfile.preschedulingPeriod or

PreschedulingProfile.preschedulingPeriod.

The Prescheduling feature is only active during the

PreschedProfile.preschedulingDuration or

PreschedulingProfile.preschedulingDuration period. The active period is

extended by a new PreschedProfile.preschedulingDuration or

PreschedulingProfile.preschedulingDuration period for each received data

on Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH) in uplink direction.

The parameter ENodeBFunction.initPreschedulingEnablemakes it possible to

control whether the feature Prescheduling is active during the connection startup phase. If

the feature is enabled, the connection setup time is reduced.

Although the eNodeB is configured for prescheduling, the following exceptions exist when the

prescheduling grant is not sent:

- To mitigate possible throughput degradation for UEs with traffic, the prescheduling candidate is not scheduled when available resources are needed by UEs with traffic.
- To avoid unnecessary UE battery consumption and inter-cell interference, prescheduling grant is not sent for a UE at poor radio coverage, for example, when uplink QPSK is used.
- Prescheduling grant is not sent for UEs that are configured for Voice over LTE (VoLTE) service.
- Prescheduling grant is not sent during the connection setup phase if ENodeBFunction.initPreschedulingEnable is not enabled.

Figure 1   Prescheduling Principle

# 4 Network Impact of Prescheduling

This section describes the benefits of the reduced round trip

time.

Capacity and Performance

The Prescheduling feature reduces round-trip, user plane and initial control plane

latencies. This leads to faster connection setup times and increased UE

throughputs.

The Prescheduling feature reduces download times because higher-level protocols

benefit from the reduced round trip time.

Increase of uplink interference is a possible consequence of using the Prescheduling

feature.

The Prescheduling feature uses free cell resources to schedule uplink transmissions

of selected UEs that did not request or report data in their buffers. In the

majority of cases these UEs have no data to send, so they need to send padding,

which increases interference.

If the UE has only got data in the buffer, it does not have to request UL

transmission from the eNodeB, as it can use the obtained Prescheduling grant. This

results in lower latency. The amount of increased UL interference can be controlled

by Prescheduling MOM parameters that control the amount and selection criteria of

Prescheduling grants. Optimal settings of these parameters depend on network

configuration and operator goals.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
