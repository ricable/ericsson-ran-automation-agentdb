# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Spectrum Analyzer

The radio frequency environment is analyzed by the Uplink Spectrum Analyzer feature

based on operator-selected action parameters, which are transferred to the

radio.

The Uplink Spectrum Analyzer feature can be set up in a Baseband unit and a radio unit

interface. The radio setup starts the spectrum sampling of the uplink measurement, and

the data collection from the active uplink measurement.

Spectrum sampling is supported at the filter branches and the ADC.

The operation of the Uplink Spectrum Analyzer feature does not affect the normal traffic

flow.

Operational Process

The feature is set up as described in the following steps:

1. The operator selects the following action parameters through the OSS interface: An RF port on a specific radio unit A center frequency A display bandwidth Note: In case of AIR 3228 B38A B78R, dual-band radio software reports specific band data of the Uplink Spectrum Analyzer feature with a valid frequency from any of the supported bands, in accordance with the capabilities of the AAS. A resolution bandwidth
2. The selected action parameters are transferred to the radio requesting one of the following types of spectrum samples: Immediate spectrum sample (snapshot) Continuous spectrum sample Conditional spectrum sample These parameters are selected based on the capabilities reported by the radio.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Spectrum Analyzer
