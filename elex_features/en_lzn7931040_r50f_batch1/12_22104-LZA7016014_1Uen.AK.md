Summary

The feature enables the node to use RJ45 Ethernet ports, and SFP-optical or

SFP-Direct Attached Cable, as frequency synchronization reference.

# 2 Dependencies of Synchronous Ethernet

The feature has dependencies with a feature related to providing a time reference,

and has network requirements.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

| Feature                               | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assisted Time Holdover (FAJ 121 4728) | Related        | The feature extends the time holdover period when the primary             time synchronization source fails as long as the assistant is fault free. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The feature must be supported by all equipment between the synchronization source and

the node.The Ethernet interface must be Ethernet ports (RJ45, SFP-optical or

SFP-Direct Attached Cable). SFP with electrical interface is not supported.

# 3 Feature Operation of Synchronous Ethernet

The frequency is extracted from the bit rate of the Ethernet port (RJ45, SFP-optical or

SFP-Direct Attached Cable) at the Ethernet ingress port, and the bit rate of the Ethernet signal

is synchronized to the internal Radio Clock frequency at the output ports.

If the RadioEquipmentClock.currentRadioClockReference is a member of LAG,

the SSM value Do Not Use is sent out on all member ports. All Ethernet switches between the

Synchronization source and the node must support Synchronous Ethernet and Quality Level

Management. Quality Level Management must be enabled in the node, and to use the Quality Level

received on the Ethernet interface LagPort.

# 4 Network Impact of Synchronous Ethernet

The feature affects the capacity and performance of the network.

Capacity and Performance

When an EthernetPort is already used by the feature, and it is selected

as active reference, adding or removing the EthernetPort on a

LagPort causes Sync reference changed or a temporary holdover.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Synchronous Ethernet

# 6 Performance of Synchronous Ethernet

The feature does not have associated KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Synchronous Ethernet

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Perform one of the following depending on node type:
    - For DU radio nodes, set the featureStateSyncEth attribute on MO Synchronization to ACTIVATED.
    - For Baseband nodes, set the featureState attribute on MO FeatureState=CXC4040011 to ACTIVATED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Synchronous Ethernet

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Perform one of the following depending on node type:
    - For DU radio nodes, set the featureStateSyncEth attribute on MO Synchronization to DEACTIVATED.
    - For Baseband nodes, set the featureState attribute on MO FeatureState=CXC4040011 to DEACTIVATED.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
