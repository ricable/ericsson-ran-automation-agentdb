Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

When the Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring feature is enabled by the

operator, indicators are only broadcast when access class barring is enabled and

broadcast.

# 3 Feature Operation of Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring

This feature can prioritize VoLTE traffic by allowing UEs to skip access class barring

check when moving to connected mode due to establishing a VoLTE service.

One IE for each traffic class in SIB2 indicates whether Prioritization of VoLTE in Access

Barring is enabled for a traffic class.

The skipping is enabled for each traffic class separately in each cell. When the controlling

MOM attribute is set to true for a traffic class, SIB2 is updated with the

corresponding IE. This happens directly at activation or deactivation of the Prioritization of

VoLTE in Access Barring feature and broadcast at the next scheduled occasion.

Skipping Access Barring Check for VoLTE Services for Certain PLMN

With the PLMN-Specific Access Barring feature, the skip can be configured per PLMN,

within PLMN-specific access barring configuration profiles.

The skip can be allowed for the following traffic classes separately, by setting the

relevant MOM attribute to true.

# 4 Network Impact of Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring

When this feature is active, UEs are allowed to skip the access class barring check for

mobile originating traffic.

Capacity and Performance

This feature does not affect the capacity of the system, but when Prioritization of VoLTE

in Access Barring feature is active, UEs are allowed to bypass the Access Class Barring

check for the following types of mobile originating traffic:

- MMTEL voice
- MMTEL video
- SMSoIP
- SMS

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Prioritization of VoLTE in Access Barring

The feature offers to configure skipping access class barring check for prioritized

service types.
