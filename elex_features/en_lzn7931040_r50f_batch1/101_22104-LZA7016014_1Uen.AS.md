# 1 Cell ID-Based Location Support Overview

This feature provides an estimate on the UE position with an accuracy depending on the

cell size. The UE location based on the cell ID for a specific UE is transferred to the MME

upon request.

Summary

The Cell ID-Based Location Support feature ensures that the serving MME always has the correct

CGI for the served active UE.

The feature provides an estimate on the UE position that allows positioning and localization

services that do not require high resolution. The accuracy of the UE positioning

depends on the cell size. The UE location based on the cell ID for a specific UE is

transferred to the MME upon request.

# 3 Feature Operation of Cell ID-Based Location Support

The feature ensures that the MME has the correct CGI for the served active UE upon the

request of the MME.

## 3.1 Location Reporting in LTE Deployment

The request of the MME can trigger the location reporting operation at handovers or the

MME can also request a single report from the eNodeB on the position of a specific

UE.

Location Reporting at Handovers

Figure 1   Location Reporting at Handovers

| eNodeB 1   |    | The eNodeB that first serves the UE in the beginning of the process.                                         |
|------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|            |    |                                                                                                              |
| eNodeB 2   |    | The target eNodeB that serves the UE during and after the inter-eNodeB                             handover. |

The location reporting operation at handovers has the following process steps:

1. The MME initiates the location reporting process by sending the S1AP LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message to the eNodeB 1.
2. The MME requests the eNodeB 1 to report when the UE changes service cell in the eNodeB 1, that is, at intra-eNodeB handover.
3. If the UE performs an intra-eNodeB handover, the eNodeB transmits the LOCATION REPORT message as requested by the MME containing the CGI of the new service cell.
4. Information about the MME request for the LOCATION REPORT message at change of service cell is transmitted to target eNodeB 2 as part of X2 handover signaling, that is, at inter-eNodeB handover.
5. The MME requests the eNodeB 2 to report when the UE changes service cell in the eNodeB 2, that is, at intra-eNodeB handover.
6. If the UE performs an intra-eNodeB handover, the eNodeB 2 transmits the LOCATION REPORT message as requested by the MME containing the CGI for the new service cell.
7. The MME terminates the location reporting process by sending the S1AP LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message to the eNodeB 2 requesting the eNodeB 2 to stop reporting at handovers.

## 3.2 Location Reporting in EN-DC Deployment

The Master Node sends the PSCell ID to the MME in the S1AP LOCATION REPORT

message if the following conditions are met:

- The ENodeBFunction.locationReportForPSCell attribute is set to true.
- A request for location report with PSCell ID is sent by the MME to the Master Node.

The Master Node sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORT with the PSCell ID after

the following procedures:

- Secondary Node Addition procedure
- Master Node Initiated Secondary Cell Group Addition procedure

Location Reporting during Secondary Node Addition Procedure

Figure 2   Location Reporting during Secondary Node Addition

Location reporting during Secondary Node Addition is executed according to the

following steps:

1. The MME sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message to the Master Node. The Request Type IE indicates to the Master Node to report upon change of serving cell and the Additional Location Information IE indicates to include the PSCell ID.
2. The Master Node sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORT message to the MME with ECGI.
3. During the Secondary Node Addition procedure, the Master Node sends the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message to the Secondary Node with the Location Information at SgNB Reporting IE set to pscell. The Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message with the Location Information at SgNB IE including the PSCell ID.
4. The Master Node sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORT message to the MME with the PSCell ID of the NR cell. Note: The Master Node stores the PSCell ID until it receives new a PSCell ID.

Procedure

Addition

Location reporting during the Master Node Initiated Secondary Cell Group Addition

procedure is executed according to the following steps:

1. The MME sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message to the Master Node. The Request Type IE indicates to the Master Node to report upon change of serving cell and the Additional Location Information IE indicates to include the PSCell ID.
2. The Master Node sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORT message to the MME with ECGI.
3. During the Master Node Initiated Secondary Cell Group Addition, the Master Node sends the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message including the Location Information at SgNB Reporting IE set to pscell to the Secondary Node. The Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message with the Location Information at SgNB IE with PSCell ID.
4. The Master Node sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORT message to the MME with the PSCell ID of the NR cell. Note: The Master Node stores the PSCell ID until it receives a new PSCell ID.

## 3.3 Single Location Reporting

Single Location Reporting

Figure 4   Single Location Reporting

The Single Location Reporting procedure is executed according to the following steps:

1. The MME initiates the location reporting process by sending the S1AP LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message to the eNodeB.
2. The eNodeB transmits the LOCATION REPORT message as requested by the MME containing the CGI for the new service cell. Since the MME requested only one LOCATION REPORT message to be transmitted directly, no termination message is needed.

Single Location Reporting with PSCell ID

In EN-DC deployments, the MME can request location information with PSCell ID from

the Master Node.

The Master Node sends the PSCell ID to the MME in the S1AP LOCATION

REPORT message if the following conditions are met:

- The ENodeBFunction.locationReportForPSCell attribute is set to true.
- A request for a single location report with the PSCell ID is sent by the MME to the Master Node.

Figure 5   Single Time Location Report with PSCell ID

The Single Location Reporting with PSCell ID procedure is executed according to the

following steps:

1. The MME sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message to the eNodeB. The Request Type IE indicates to the eNodeB to report directly and the Additional Location Information IE indicates to include the PSCell ID.
2. The eNodeB sends the S1AP LOCATION REPORT message, which includes the PSCell ID, as requested by the MME.

# 4 Network Impact of Cell ID-Based Location Support

The feature has no impact on the capacity and performance.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

The following S1AP procedures are supported by the eNodeB:

| Location Reporting Control         |    | The MME triggers the eNodeB to report the CGI for a specific UE.                 |
|------------------------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                    |    |                                                                                  |
| Location Report                    |    | On the request of the MME, the eNodeB reports the CGI of a served UE to the MME. |
|                                    |    |                                                                                  |
| Location Report Failure Indication |    | The eNodeB informs the MME if the Location Reporting Control procedure fails.    |

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of Cell ID-Based Location Support

This feature guarantees that the serving Mobility Management Entity (MME) will always

have the correct Cell Global Identity (CGI) for served active UE.

The feature provides a rough estimate of the UE position, the UE position is provided

with accuracy corresponding to the cell size. Since it is known which cell the UE is in

this can lead to accurate location estimation if cell size is small.

For more information, see Feature Description

Cell ID-Based Location

Support.
