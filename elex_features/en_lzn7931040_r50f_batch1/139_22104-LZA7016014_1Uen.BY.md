# 1 Load-Based Access Barring Overview

The Load-Based Access Barring feature protects already established bearers in

high-load situations to ensure that severe performance degradation does not

occur.

| Feature Name           | Load-Based Access Barring                                                  |

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

At high levels of offered traffic, the number of access attempts can become too

large, overloading the eNodeB or the air interface control channels that cannot be

resolved by other load-handling features. The feature increases the chance that

prioritized users who belong to access classes 10-15, for example, public safety and

emergency calls, can always enter the network, even during overload conditions.

Certain users and emergency calls are prioritized based on the access class concept

defined in 3GPP. The following high-priority users are defined:

- Users that belong to access class 10 and perform emergency access calls.
- Users that belong to access class 11-15 and perform high priority access calls.
- Users that perform mobile-originating CSFB calls.

The Load-Based Access Barring feature must be                                 activated and triggered in the overloaded cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The following configurations exist for the presence attribute for each access  class                 barring parameter in the AcBarringPresence struct:  OFF     MANUAL     AUTO      If the presence of an access attempt type is set to MANUAL,                 manual access class barring is applied. If the presence is set to                     AUTO, automatic access class barring functionality is started                 automatically when the system becomes congested. The barring factor is recalculated                 periodically and sent to the UEs in the SIB2 message until the system is not                 congested. Then the automatic access class barring mechanism is stopped. |
| MME Overload Control  (FAJ 121 3097)                                                              | Related        | MME Overload Control increases the number of rejected UEs             while MMEs are in overload state. This can trigger automatic access barring, and             activate the presence of access class barring parameters in SIB2 due to increased ratio             of RRC Connection Rejects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It is removed from the list of candidates for inter-frequency                 load balancing. This is to avoid handover to an already overloaded cell. The load                 measurement is ongoing to enable the outgoing handover to other cells, and to                 decrease the load faster. If load balancing during access class barring is disabled,                 all inter-frequency load balancing processes are disabled in the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If                 Progressive Access Barring is activated, Load-Based Access Barring is replaced by it                 to avoid further congestion. As opposed to Load-Based Access Barring, in Progressive                 Access Barring it is possible to set different priority levels of traffic classes                 and configure different maximum barring probability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## 2.1 Compatibility of Load Balancing and Automatic Access Barring

During ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, inter-frequency

load balancing for incoming handover is disabled in the cell.

When automatic access class barring is used together with Inter-Frequency Load Balancing,

the incoming handover to an overloaded cell is disabled.

Inter-frequency load balancing is enabled in the cell when the barring probability

reaches 0.

If load balancing during access class barring is enabled, that is

EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true, the

following events occur:

- The subscription ratio measurements are still ongoing in the cell when the automatic access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered.
- The function enables the cell for outgoing load balancing handover, and a faster recovery from overload.
- Triggering of the access class barring calculation mechanism does not disable subscription ratio evaluation and Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, by setting

the PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute to

true, and the cell is configured as

priority cell, triggering of the access class barring calculation

mechanism does not disable the following events:

- Subscription ratio evaluation
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload

A cell is configured as priority cell if the following is true:

- PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY.
- The EUtranCellFDD.ptmCellProfileRef or the EUtranCellTDD.ptmCellProfileRef reference to a cell profile is set as priority.

Example 1   Automatic Access Class Barring Disables

Load Balancing

Figure 1   Inter-Frequency Load Management Disabled by Automatic Access Barring

The following events occur during the access class barring calculation

mechanism:

1. Before t1, inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled.
2. At t1, these load balancing functions are disabled, and automatic access class barring calculation is enabled.
3. Between t1 and t4, until the automatic access class barring calculation is enabled, the load balancing functions remain disabled.
4. At t4, the barring probability reaches its minimum value, that is 0. Inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled again.
5. Between t5 and t6, inter-frequency load balancing is disabled again.
6. Between t6 and t7, outgoing inter-frequency load balancing is enabled only if EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true.
7. At t7, the barring probability reaches its minimum value again. Inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload are enabled again.

# 3 Feature Operation of Load-Based Access Barring

The Load-Based Access Barring feature starts to operate at high load and changes

barring factor automatically, based on the traffic load in the cell.  Load-Based Access Barring

is the basic automatic access class barring functionality.

Automatic Access Class Barring

Automatic access class barring monitors the ratio between RRC Connection

Rejects and RRC Connection Attempts and activates or

deactivates access class barring parameters in SIB2 messages. Automatic access

class                 barring uses barring information from SIB2 broadcast messages to inform UEs about

the congestion level in the system.

Access class barring starts to operate when the access class barring calculation

mechanism is triggered by the following conditions being true:

- The ratio between RRC Connection Rejects and RRC Connection Attempts is above EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh or EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh for a time interval EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh or EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh.
- The intensity of the RRC Connection Requests is higher than the minimum intensity.

During ongoing access class barring calculation mechanism, the following applies to

all access attempt types the presence of which is set to AUTO:

- The barring factor (1 - barring probability) for the common or the PLMN-specific access class barring parameter for the access attempt type is included in the next SIB2 broadcast message.
- Barring probability for the access attempt type is changed periodically, based on the measured load in the cell and the MOM configuration.
- If a UE attempts to connect to the cell and it can be barred based on its access class and access attempt type, access class barring is applied to the UE. UEs are informed about access class barring parameters in SIB2 broadcast messages.
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and subscription ratio measurements are disabled for the cell if the following criteria is fulfilled: Preferential Traffic Management is disabled, or the cell is not configured as a priority cell. Load balancing during access class barring is disabled.

Automatic access class barring calculation is continued

until no congestion is detected.

Load-Based Access Barring

Figure 2   Barring Probability Changing in Load-Based Access Barring

Load-Based Access Barring can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originated data
- Mobile originated signaling

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to AUTO, barring factors are

updated for the traffic class in the common access class barring parameters.

When the access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered, barring probability

is increased by EUtranCellFDD.lbabIncr or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabIncr.

During the ongoing access class barring calculation mechanism, barring

probability is changed every EUtranCellFDD.lbabPeriod or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabPeriod depending on the relation

between the traffic load and LBAB thresholds, and the barring trend.

EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh

and

EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeLow

or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeLow

are used to check the RRC Connection Reject ratio

whenever an automatic access class barring

functionality runs.

When the barring probability reached its maximum-the configured minimum

barring factor-the barring factor is not changed until the conditions for

decreasing it are fulfilled.

The barring factor (1 - barring probability) is updated in SIB2, and the updated

barring factor is included in the next SIB2 broadcast message.

All UEs with a USIM are members of one of 10 randomly allocated classes, defined as access

classes 0-9.

In addition, a UE can be a member of one or more of the five special categories, defined as

access classes 11-15.

In accordance with 3GPP TS 22.011, the following access classes allocated to

specific user categories:

- Class 15: PLMN staff
- Class 14: Emergency Services
- Class 13: Public Utilities
- Class 12: Security Services
- Class 11: For PLMN Use

Access class 10 is an independent class especially designed for emergency calls barring. It

enables network access control if emergency calls are allowed for UEs with access classes 0-9

or without an IMSI. For UEs with access classes 11-15, emergency calls are not allowed if both

access class 10 and any of the relevant access classes 11-15 are barred. Otherwise, emergency

calls are allowed.

Access classes 0-9 apply in any home or visited PLMN. Access classes 11 and 15 apply to the

home PLMN and any equivalent home PLMN. Access classes 12-14 apply to any home PLMN or visited

PLMN in the home country of the mobile subscription. The home country is defined by the Mobile

Country Code (MCC) part of the IMSI. The IMSI is stored on the USIM.

### 3.2.1 Manual Access Class Barring

Manual Access Class Barring is the basic access class barring functionality. The

operation of this functionality depends only on MOM configuration, and it is independent of

the traffic load situation.

The Manual Access Class Barring functionality does not require any licensed feature.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are determined

for each traffic class based on the values of the corresponding MOM attributes.

Barring factors specified in MOM are broadcast in SIB2 messages only if the presence of

each traffic class in SIB2 is set to MANUAL. If the presence of a

traffic class in SIB2 is set to any other value-OFF or

AUTO-the AC-BarringConfig element for that traffic class is not

present in SIB2.

### 3.2.2 Load-Based Access Barring

Load-Based Access Barring is the basic automatic access class barring functionality.

The operation of this functionality depends on the traffic load situation.

The Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the Load-Based Access Barring

licensed feature is activated.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.2.3 PLMN Load-Based Access Barring

PLMN Load-Based Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. The operation of this functionality

depends on both the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access barring

configuration.

The PLMN Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access

barring configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.2.4 Progressive Access Barring

Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality that

extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. This functionality prioritizes the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

Access class barring in the common access class barring parameters starts for the traffic

classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. When the barring factor reaches

the minimum barring factor for a traffic priority level access class barring is

continued on the next higher priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.2.5 PLMN Progressive Access Barring

PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality takes the

PLMN-specific access barring configuration into account when prioritizing the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms so that the traffic classes in the PLMN-specific access barring parameters are also taken into account.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.2.6 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in addition to prioritizing the traffic

classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to

true.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN priority level, the level is skipped.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are set the same value for the traffic class as the barring factors for the traffic class on the lowest PLMN priority level.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.

### 3.2.7 Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the special access class in traffic classes in addition to prioritizing the

standard access classes.

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

If the presence of a traffic class of a special access class in SIB2 is set to

AUTO, the following applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.2.8 PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access

class         barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

feature. This functionality takes the PLMN-specific access barring configuration into

account when prioritizing the special access classes for access class barring.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

There is no priority relation between PLMNs.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

### 3.2.9 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic

access class barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access

Classes feature. This functionality prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in

addition to prioritizing the special access classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to true.

If the PLMN priority is lower than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to barred.

If the PLMN priority is higher than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to not barred.

If the PLMN priority is equal to the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set as follows:

- If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

Hence, the priority relations among standard and special access classes of traffic

classes are the same within each PLMN priority level. The priority relations among

standard and special access classes of traffic classes are defined by the Progressive

Barring for Special Access Classes configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

Enabling Minimum Intensity Limit

The feature introduces the

EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab and

EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab attributes to enable

adjustments to the minimum intensity limit of RRC

connection

requests in the cell. The intensity of RRC

connection

requests in the cell must be higher than the minimum intensity limit

for the feature to be operational.

The default value of the

EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab and

EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab attributes is

50,

which amounts to five RRC

connection

request messages every second.

Setting the value of the attributes lower than the default

value increases the probability of the Load-Based Access Barring feature being

operational in the cell. Similarly, setting the value higher than the default value

decreases the probability of the feature being operational in the cell. If the value of

the attributes is set too high, the access barring cannot be triggered, and the

Load-Based Access Barring feature can become disabled in the cell.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q2: Support for Load Balancing during Access Class Barring

This feature enhancement enables Inter-Frequency Load Balancing to continue outgoing

load balancing from overloaded cells with triggered Load-Based Access Barring.

| Feature Name:           | Load-Based Access Barring          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3093                       |
| Value Package Name:     | High Load Handling                 |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0415                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement enables outgoing load balancing by calculating subscription ratio during

triggered Load-Based Access Barring on the cell. This allows the overloaded cell to

reduce the load faster and recover to normal state.

The function is supported on any cell, not only on priority cells defined by Preferential

Traffic Management.

Capacity and Performance

The main processor load is affected because of increased load balancing actions,

signaling, and handovers.

The enhancement can trigger the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the following two new MO attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled
- EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from ENM version 19.04 or

later.
