# 1 MIMO Sleep Mode Overview

The MIMO Sleep Mode feature is an energy efficiency feature that saves energy by

changing the MIMO configuration.

| Licensing:             | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The MIMO Sleep Mode feature reduces power consumption in radios in the node. This is

achieved by automatically changing a MIMO configuration to a smaller MIMO or a SIMO

configuration when low traffic conditions are detected in the cell. The feature

provides the following:

- On and off control
- A daily time window to perform MIMO sleep detection
- Configurable traffic detection thresholds

In a smaller MIMO and SIMO configuration, power consumption is reduced because of

either of the following reasons:

- Lower RF radiation at the radio unit
- Shutting down the radio unit power amplifier of the deactivated TX antennas

The decision point and the capability depend on the radio unit capacity.

Network Requirements

This feature has two capabilities, and the need for the feature license depends on

which capability is used:

| Detection   |    | The detection capability does not require a feature license, and allows                             evaluation of energy saving opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Switching   |    | The switching capability automatically changes cell configuration from                             MIMO to SIMO, or from SIMO to MIMO. For switching capability to be                             operational, a valid license key must be installed and the feature must                             be explicitly activated by setting a MOM attribute. |

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

# 3 Feature Operation of MIMO Sleep Mode

This section describes the MIMO Sleep Mode feature in more detail, including network

configuration requirements and operation description.

Operational Process

The feature gives the eNodeB the capability to change the cell configuration from

MIMO to SIMO when low traffic is detected on the cell. It provides the

following:

- On and off control
- A daily time window to perform MIMO sleep detection
- Detection threshold parameters for each cell

The MIMO Sleep Mode feature can be enabled on one or multiple cells on the node. The

detection threshold parameters are used to control how the node performs traffic

detection to go into MIMO Sleep Mode, and to resume from it.

The feature can be turned on in DETECTION mode without a license to

evaluate and configure the MIMO Sleep Mode feature with optimal threshold settings.

In this way, opportunities for time intervals where the cell can go to MIMO Sleep

Mode can be found. When optimal feature configuration is evaluated, the feature can

be turned on in switching mode (SWITCH,

SOFT\_SWITCH or ADVANCED\_SWITCH). One feature

license is required for each node to enable MIMO sleep switching capability on all

cells.

With the SWITCH mode, the feature switches a MIMO configuration to a

SIMO by performing an automatic cell reconfiguration, where the cell is temporarily

disabled. The same happens when switching back from SIMO to MIMO.

SOFT\_SWITCH is an option that performs a cell shutdown before

cell reconfiguration, so existing traffic can be gracefully released. With the

ADVANCED\_SWITCH mode, the TX antennas are deactivated without

any cell reconfiguration and cell shutdown, to avoid cell downtime.

In case of incorrect configuration an alarm with the Configured

sleepMode &lt;value&gt; is inconsistent with combination of

parameters dlChannelBandwidth, pdcchCfiMode, and subframeAssignment configured

on parent cell MO. error message is raised. For more information,

see Inconsistent Configuration.

Conditions for entering and leaving MIMO Sleep Mode are checked once every

minute.

Values used for checking conditions (switchDownPrbThreshold,

switchDownRrcConnThreshold, switchUpPrbThreshold, and

switchUpRrcConnThreshold) are averages from the last five-minute

time period.

To enter MIMO Sleep Mode, conditions set in both

switchDownPrbThreshold and

switchDownRrcConnThreshold must be met for time duration set

in switchDownMonitorDurTimer. Similarly, to leave MIMO Sleep

Mode, conditions set in both switchUpPrbThreshold and

switchUpRrcConnThreshold must be met for time duration set in

switchUpMonitorDurTimer.

If the cell has sleepMode set to ADVANCED\_SWITCH

and portMergingEnabled set to true, then if

switchUpPrbThreshold and

switchDownPrbThreshold are higher than 40,

the value 40 is used for them instead to determine entering and

leaving MIMO Sleep Mode.

Modes of Operation

The MIMO Sleep Mode feature supports the following modes of operation in a cell. They

are configured by the sleepMode attribute in the

MimoSleepFunction MO:

When MIMO Sleep Mode with ADVANCED\_SWITCH is activated, it simply

deactivates radio chains without cell lock and unlock. It means that signals for

deactivated radio chains are lost because of antenna muting. It is equivalent to a

constant deep fading on the muted physical antennas.

When MIMO Sleep Mode with ADVANCED\_SWITCH is activated with port

merging, signals for deactivated radio chains are being treated in the following

ways:

- In a 2TX antenna cell, the feature provides the solution to merge the signals for antenna 0 and antenna 1, and to send the composite signal through antenna 0 while antenna 1 is muted.
- In a 4TX antenna cell, configured to 4TX to 1TX port merging, the feature provides the solution to merge the signals for antenna 0 and antenna 1, and to send the composite signal through antenna 0 while all other antennas are muted.
- In a 4TX antenna cell, configured to 4TX to 2TX port merging, the feature provides the solution to merge the signals for antenna pairs with the following methods: Muting antenna 1 and antenna 3, merging the signals for antenna 0 and antenna 1 and the signals for antenna 2 and antenna 3, and sending the composite signals through antenna 0 and antenna 2 respectively. Muting antenna 2 and antenna 3, merging the signals for antenna 0 and antenna 3 and the signals for antenna 1 and antenna 2, and sending the composite signals through antenna 0 and antenna 1 respectively.

The composite signal through antenna 0, antenna 1, or antenna 2 can be received

and decoded by UE. It compensates coverage loss in advanced switching MIMO Sleep

Mode on a 2TX or a 4TX cell.

TM4 rank2 Support for Advanced Switching from 4TX to 2TX Without Port

Merging

The MIMO Sleep Mode feature supports switching from 4TX to 2TX in TM4 rank 2 in

ADVANCED\_SWITCH mode if the

MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute is set to

true. This allows for spatial multiplexing and up to two layers

to be scheduled when radios are muted from 4TX to 2TX without port merging.

Public Warning System Message Handling

After reception of a PWS (ETWS, either Primary or Secondary or both, or CMAS)

notification message the following apply:

- Cell configuration from SIMO to MIMO is performed for all cells.
- Switching UP procedure for SWITCH and SOFT\_SWITCH is delayed assuring the delivery of ETWS and CMAS information to the UEs first.
- Cells within the affected area are prevented from changing the cell configuration from MIMO to SIMO until PWS broadcast is over.

Emergency Call Handling

Both legacy and advanced switching are delayed in case privileged access (including

emergency) or voice calls are present. The following table shows how the feature

handles switching in the different modes of operation.

Table 3   Emergency Call Handling

| sleepMode       | Switching DOWN            | Switching UP                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| DETECTION       | No PA calls               | No PA                                         calls(1) |
| SWITCH          | No PA calls               | No PA calls                                     (1)    |
| SOFT_SWITCH     | No PA and voice calls (2) | No PA and voice calls(3)(1)                            |
| ADVANCED_SWITCH | No PA and voice calls (2) | None                                                   |

(1)

In case of PWS notification message broadcast,

the switching UP is performed without delay regardless

of PA or voice calls present.

(2)

Take extra precaution and make sure that no voice calls

(QCI=1) are also present.

(3)

In case of a disaster, the switching UP delay for

SOFT\_SWITCH is limited to a maximum of 10 minutes.

Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

The MIMO Sleep Mode and Cell Sleep Mode features can coexist on the same node.

If the conditions for entering MIMO sleep mode are met during the cell sleep mode

time window, MIMO sleep mode can be triggered.

# 4 Network Impact of MIMO Sleep Mode

This section describes how the MIMO Sleep Mode feature affects the network functions and

capabilities.

Capacity and Performance

For low traffic hours, MIMO Sleep Mode feature can temporarily decrease cell capacity

because of cell reconfiguration from MIMO to SIMO.

Interfaces

Based on the mode of operation, the MIMO Sleep Mode feature can temporarily decrease

cell coverage because of cell reconfiguration from MIMO to SIMO for low traffic

hours and back for high traffic hours.

When a cell enters Sleep Mode using 4Tx Port Merging functionality, it has the

following benefits depending on the operating mode:

- 4TX to 2TX port merging mode minimizes coverage loss.
- 4TX to 1TX port merging mode increases energy saving gain.

When a cell enters Sleep Mode using 2Tx Port Merging functionality, it has the

benefit of minimizing coverage loss.

Other Network Elements

Incoming S1/X2 handover requests are rejected during cell reconfiguration from MIMO

to SIMO, or from SIMO to MIMO.

Its purpose is to                                     reflect the probability of an established E-RAB becoming lost                                     with an abnormal release.  The MIMO Sleep Mode feature offers the option to perform a                                         SOFT SWITCH, which internally performs a                                     cell shutdown before cell reconfiguration from MIMO to SIMO, or                                     from SIMO to MIMO. Using SOFT SWITCH mode                                     reduces impact on E-RAB retainability, as cell shutdown attempts                                     to move out existing traffic gracefully before the cell is                                     locked for reconfiguration. If SWITCH mode is                                     used instead of SOFT SWITCH, the cell is locked                                     immediately for reconfiguration and all existing traffic in a                                     cell is dropped. When ADVANCED_SWITCH is used                                     with the MimoSleepFunction​.rank2Enabled                                     attribute set to true, this KPI might be                                     decreased. |

time in Sweden begins at 02:00 AM on the last Sunday of March, when the clock is set

forward one hour. The clock is set back one hour at 03:00 AM on the last Sunday in

October.

The start date and end date of the daylight saving time can be set by the members of

the DstRule struct in the following attributes:

- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeStartDate
- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeEndDate

The data that is transmitted in the IEs can be configured by the DstRule struct in the

timeSettings MO.

Table 8   Configuration Example

## 9.1 Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

MIMO sleep state can be triggered during cell sleep mode time windows if conditions

for MIMO reduction are met.

If the conditions for entering MIMO sleep mode are met, and cell sleep state is not

active during the cell sleep mode time window, MIMO sleep state can be active. If the

conditions for entering cell sleep state are met, the capacity cell enters sleep state

and MIMO

sleep

state is deactivated, as cell sleep mode is prioritized.

After the capacity cell exits cell sleep state in ADVANCED\_SWITCH

and

in MI\_SWITCH modes, the capacity cell goes back to full MIMO configuration. When the

conditions for entering MIMO sleep state are met again during the cell sleep mode time

window, the

MIMO

sleep state can be activated again.

After the capacity cell exits cell sleep state in SWITCH

and

in SOFT\_SWITCH modes, the capacity cell goes back to the MIMO sleep mode configuration

that is

valid

before entering cell sleep state.

In case the Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode features try to trigger their respective

sleep states at the same time, priority is given to the Cell Sleep Mode feature.

It is recommended that some parameter thresholds of the Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep

Mode features are set to values that are

different

from the default values. The following setup is recommended:

- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownPrbThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute.
- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownRrcConnThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellRrcConnSleepThreshold attribute.

While the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled, the

following setup is recommended:

- The MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is recommended to be set to ADVANCED\_SWITCH.
- The sum of the CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold and the CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpDlPrbOffset attribute values is recommended to be greater than the value of the MimoSleepFunction.switchUpPrbThreshold attribute.
- The sum of the CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold and the CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpRrcOffset attribute values is recommended to be greater than the value of the MimoSleepFunction.switchUpRrcConnThreshold attribute.

## 9.2 Configuration Guidelines for Carrier Branch Mapping

Carrier branch mapping used with the MIMO Sleep Mode feature affects the

predictability of whether the resulting configuration supports radio sleep and preserves

polarization diversity.

The following configurations are used to map carrier branches:

The carrier branch mapping configurations interact in the following ways:

- If Deterministic Carrier Allocation is not configured, polarization-agnostic mapping is used by default.
- Deterministic Carrier Allocation overrides polarization-aware and polarization-agnostic mapping.

It is recommended to use the MIMO Sleep Mode feature with polarization-aware mapping or

Deterministic Carrier Allocation. This increases the predictability of whether the

resulting configuration supports radio sleep and preserves polarization diversity.

Polarization-agnostic mapping does not offer the same predictability.

Polarization-aware mapping is compliant with 3GPP TS 36.101.

Energy performance depends on the chosen ABB and RBB.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q1: MIMO Sleep Mode: 4Tx Advanced Switching Support

Enhancement to the MIMO Sleep Mode feature, that provides advanced switching support for 4Tx cells without cell reset.

| Feature Name:           | MIMO Sleep Mode                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3094 R4                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Energy Efficiency                  |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0413 R7                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement to the MIMO Sleep Mode feature provides advanced switching support for 4Tx cells

without cell reset. Gradual step down and step up is performed to assist UE transition.

TM3 and TM4 connections continue to be supported during sleep, however, 256QAM and TM4

transmit diversity restrictions are applied.

Advanced switch DOWN sequence:

1. On a 4Tx cell, transmit diversity restriction and 256QAM restriction are both applied.
2. Fifty percent of the antennas are deactivated. 2Tx reduces to 1Tx, 4Tx to 2Tx in a gradual fashion.

Advanced switch UP sequence:

1. All antennas are re-activated. 1Tx returns to 2Tx, 2Tx returns to 4Tx in a gradual fashion.
2. On 4Tx cell, transmit diversity restriction and 256QAM restriction are both stopped.

The cell remains active during the switching process, therefore there is no cell

downtime. Existing UE traffic is retained and new UE traffic continues to be admitted

during the switching down process.

Capacity and Performance

Regardless of the mode of operation, MIMO Sleep Mode deactivates antennas, and therefore can

have impact on coverage. Machine type communications, including NB-IoT and CAT-M are

more sensitive to coverage impacts, especially if the type of communication requires

full-time coverage support, like in the case of security alarm signals.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 18.Q1: MIMO Sleep Mode without Traffic Interrupt (Support for 2 Tx)

Advanced switching between MIMO and SIMO is introduced to eliminate any traffic interruption.

| Feature Name:           | MIMO Sleep Mode                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3094 R4                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Energy efficiency                  |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0413 R7                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

As part of the MIMO Sleep Mode feature, advanced switching between MIMO and SIMO is

possible on

2TX

cells during low traffic hours. With advanced switching there is no traffic interruption

when switching between MIMO and SIMO. The cell does not have to be locked to perform the

switch.

The legacy switching options are still supported on all Baseband types.

Capacity and Performance

The following two attributes have new default values:

- switchDownPrbThreshold Default reduced from 15 to 10.
- switchDownRrcConnThreshold Default reduced from 30 to 5.

These changes reduce capacity and performance impact to the current cells due to the

previous default switch down thresholds. MIMO sleep durations may be affected in

comparison to legacy.

Operation

The attribute sleepMode on the MO MimoSleepFunction can be set to the

value ADVANCED\_SWITCH on a 2Tx cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.c: 19.Q2: Public Warning System Support in MIMO Sleep Mode and Cell Sleep Mode

This feature enhancement enables overall cell wake up procedure (either Cell Sleep

Mode or MIMO Sleep Mode) in the node when Public Warning System (PWS) message is

received.

| Feature Name:           | Cell Sleep Mode  MIMO Sleep Mode   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4390  FAJ 121 3094         |
| Value Package Name:     | Energy Efficiency                  |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0413                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement secures that the mobile network can be prepared faster for expected high

traffic demand.

The feature enhancement prevents transition to sleep state (either Cell Sleep Mode or

MIMO Sleep Mode) for all cells with activated Cell Sleep Mode or MIMO Sleep Mode within

the affected emergency area until Public Warning System broadcast is over.

Capacity and Performance

The full network capacity is secured for expected traffic load, making all sleeping

resources immediately available after receiving a public warning message.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.d: 20.Q1: 2TX Port Merging

This enhancement compensates coverage loss in advanced switching MIMO Sleep Mode on a

2TX cell by using a 2TX port merging solution.

| Feature Name:           | MIMO Sleep Mode                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3094                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Energy Efficiency                  |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0413                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement allows for port merging per cell when MIMO Sleep Mode is activated by

introducing a new attribute. The port merging compensates for the coverage loss caused

by the deactivation of radio chains. The new

MimoSleepFunction.portMergingEnabled attribute configures whether

the port merging is enabled during MIMO Sleep Mode. The parameter is only valid if the

MIMO Sleep Mode is set to ADVANCED\_SWITCH. 2Tx port merging saves

energy with minimum coverage loss as in 2TX MIMO Sleep Mode the downlink signals on the

muted antenna are merged to the remaining active antenna.

The existing attributes are updated for fast detection of exit or enter sleep states of

the antennas in advanced switching MIMO Sleep Mode. The range of

MimoSleepFunction.switchDownMonitordurTimer and

MimoSleepFunction.switchUpMonitordurTimer attributes are extended

from 5 to 120 minutes to 1 to 120 minutes.

Capacity and Performance

Compared

to 2TX MIMO sleep mode, the coverage enhancement is achieved by port merging. The

coverage is the same as for MIMO, but can be slightly less based on channel conditions.

Downlink

throughput is limited by bandwidth reduction. Cell coverage can be affected during

the switching periods for a few seconds, because of turning on and off the

antennas.

Operation

The MimoSleepFunction.switchUpPrbThreshold attribute for MIMO

Sleep

wake-up

threshold must be configured lower than 40% of the whole downlink bandwidth PRBs.

Otherwise, the MIMO Sleep wake up is not triggered.

Since there are insufficient Control Channel Elements (CCEs) to transmit PDCCH for

common channel messages (for example, SIB1 or SI), when the port merging is enabled,

the following pdcchCfiMode limitations are applied:

- In case that EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth or EUtranCellTDD.channelBandwidth is 1400, 3000, and 5000 kHz, all CFIs are not supported.
- In case that EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth or EUtranCellTDD.channelBandwidth is 10000, 15000, and 20000 kHz, the CFI must not be configured to lower than 2.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM 19.04 or later is required.

## Appendix A.e: 20.Q2: Automatic Daylight Savings Time Handling for Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode

This enhancement allows Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode to automatically adjust

to Daylight Savings Time

changes.

| Feature Name:           | Cell Sleep Mode  MIMO Sleep Mode   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4390  FAJ 121 3094         |
| Value Package Name:     | Energy Efficiency R9               |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0413                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Benefits

The main benefit of this enhancement is the possibility of lowering operational costs

by automating DST related parameter changes that would require recurring manual

setting.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

During the configuration procedure of the DST settings, the sleep time window needs

to be configured in relation to the relevant standard time. This means that sleep

time needs to be configured in a way

that

it represents standard time expressed in Coordinated Universal

Time (UTC).

New read-only attributes are introduced for the visibility of currently applied start

and end sleep time values. This enables the operator to monitor whether the proper

values are used after configuration.

Table 11   New Attributes

| New Attribute         | MO Class                        | Description   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|

| sleepEndTimeApplied   | EUtranCellFDD and EUtranCellTDD | Read Only.    |

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 19.17 or later is required.

## Appendix A.f: 20.Q3: 4TX Port Merging

This enhancement improves MIMO Sleep Mode behavior by introducing new operating

modes.

| Feature Name:           | MIMO Sleep Mode     |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3094        |
| Value Package Name:     | Energy Efficiency   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0413        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Benefits

The enhancement has the following benefits compared to the legacy 4Tx MIMO Sleep

mode, depending on the operating mode:

- 4TX to 2TX port merging mode minimizes coverage loss.
- 4TX to 1TX port merging mode increases energy saving gain.

Port merging is transparent to the UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement may have a positive impact on cell coverage, depending on feature

configuration.

The enhancement may have a negative impact on downlink throughput, depending on

feature configuration, because of bandwidth reduction.

When a cell enters MIMO Sleep Mode using 4Tx Port Merging functionality, the feature

can impact the amount of discarded packets, which can be observed as an increase in

pmPdcpPktDiscDlAqm and

pmPdcpPktDiscDlPelr. This leads to a change in DL Packet Error

Loss Rate KPIs.

NB-IoT communication may experience higher coverage degradation when 4Tx Port Merging

is activated and one of the following settings applies:

- portMerging4TxOpMode is set to PORT\_MERGING\_4TX\_TO\_2TX and portMergingOptionFor4TxTo2Tx is set to MUTE\_ANT\_1\_AND\_3
- portMerging4TxOpMode is set to PORT\_MERGING\_4TX\_TO\_1TX

Operation

The following attributes are introduced to configure 4Tx port merging:

- MimoSleepFunction.portMerging4TxOpMode
- MimoSleepFunction.portMergingOptionFor4TxTo2Tx

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

Not supported on DUS Nodes.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network element:

- ENM Upgrade to ENM version 19.4 is required.

sleep mode with advanced switching.

| Feature Name:           | MIMO Sleep Mode     |

| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows 256-QAM-capable UEs with good downlink quality to use

higher modulation and achieve higher data rate. It removes the 256-QAM restriction

applied when a 4TX antenna cell is reduced to 1TX or 2TX using advanced

switching.

rate.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables full support for the MIMO Sleep Mode feature and the

LTE AI Powered Sleep Mode feature on the ESCell in inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation.

If the value of the MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is set

to ADVANCED\_SWITCH or MI\_SWITCH for the ESCell,

MIMO sleep mode-related data of the ESCell is forwarded to the PCell for correct

scheduling.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- On the ESCell, the downlink HARQ BLER might improve.
- On the ESCell, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt and EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt PM counters might increase.
- On the PCell, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt and EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt PM counters might increase.Note: These benefits are realized under specific conditions. For example, the radios mute from 4TX to 2TX and before the ESCell enters MIMO sleep mode, the UE is scheduled to four layers on ESCell. Under a complex traffic model in the field, the increase of the pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt and pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt PM counters might not easily be observed.
- The power consumption of radio units of the Secondary Node might be reduced when entering MIMO sleep mode.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink throughput for ESCell traffic might improve.

- Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average DL PDCP UE Throughput

The Dl Spectral Efficiency of Prb Payload resource indicator might increase when TM4

rank 2 is used.

The E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost KPI might decrease when TM4 rank 2 is

used.

Downlink HARQ BLER might increase compared to the basic operation of the feature.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute to allow switching

from 4TX to 2TX in TM4 rank 2 in ADVANCED\_SWITCH mode.

This feature enhancement modifies the behavior of the

EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioTxRankDistr and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioTxRankDistr PM counters so that the

correct rank value scheduled by the eNodeB is indicated when MIMO Sleep Mode is

active. Depending on the configuration of the

MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute, the PM counters

are pegged in the following way:

- If the MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute is set to true, bin [0], bin [3], and bin [4] are pegged.
- If the MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute is set to false, only bin [0] is pegged.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is not supported in Radio Gateway configurations.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.1 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
