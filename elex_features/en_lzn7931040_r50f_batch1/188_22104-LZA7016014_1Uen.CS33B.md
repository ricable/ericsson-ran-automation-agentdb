# 1 LTE Broadcast Overview

The

LTE

Broadcast feature is a point-to-multipoint service that transmits data from a

single source entity to multiple recipients.

Summary

LTE Broadcast can be used for file download and for streaming services, for example mobile

television, and it is based on the eMBMS.

On the

Uu interface, the Multicast-Broadcast Single-Frequency Network transmission mode

applies. The transmission mode allows for synchronous transmission of the

same signal from all cells within the MBSFN area, which enables UEs to combine eMBMS

transmissions

from multiple cells. This multicast solution allows for a more efficient use of radio

resources than a unicast solution does, because transmitting the same data to multiple

recipients allows network resources to be shared.

The eMBMS is realized in the 3GPP specifications by adding various capabilities to existing

functional entities of the 3GPP architecture and adding the following functional entities:

| Broadcast Multicast Service Centre   |    | Controls                 MBMS sessions and corresponding eMBMS bearers.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                      |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MCE                                  |    | Performs                 admission control and allocation of radio resources used by all eNodeBs in the                 Multicast-Broadcast Single-Frequency Network area. MCE is a logical entity that can                 be part of another Network Element. |

The MCE functions are distributed to the eNodeBs and the radio resources

that

are used for LTE broadcast are configured in the same way in all eNodeBs.

MCE.

Hardware

No

specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The LTE Broadcast feature does not operate if two LTE capacity modules are configured

with mixed mode.

Network Requirements

Other nodes, such as MME, MBMS GW, BM-SC must be ready to run LTE Broadcast. These

nodes are not LTE RAN nodes so they are not included in LTE RAN CPI.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Broadcast

This feature

enables the eNodeB to join an MBSFN area to start multicasting through MBMS

sessions.

MBMS Session Handling

The LTE Broadcast feature operates through MBSFN transmissions in the cells. Several MBMS

sessions can run simultaneously in one or several MbsfnArea MO

instances.

When an MBSFN area is activated in a cell, the following is done by the system:

- Information about SIB13 is added to the SchedulingInfoList IE in SIB1.
- The subframes that belong to the MBSFN area are added to the mbsfn-SubframeConfigList IE in SIB2.
- The MBSFN area information is added to the mbsfn-AreaInfoList IE in SIB13 and SIB13 is scheduled if this is not already done.
- The subframes that belong to the MBSFN area are blocked from usage for unicast traffic.
- The MCCH and the MTCH are scheduled on the subframes that belong to the MBSFN area.

The eNodeBs accept a session start request message that is sent from the internal MCE and

send a response to it if the message belongs to the indicated service area and it contains a

configured Temporary Mobile Group Identity. This includes cases where the session cannot be

transmitted over the air due to configuration errors, such as the following:

- Subframes of the MbsfnArea MO overlapping with another active MbsfnArea MO.
- Subframes of the MbsfnArea MO has administrative state locked.
- The multicast tunnel cannot be set up.

For more information about the MBMS sessions, see Internal

MCE.

MBMS Synchronization

An MBSFN area consists of multiple cells in which transmission of identical waveforms is

simultaneously performed. MBSFN transmission from multiple cells within the MBSFN area is

seen as a single transmission by a UE. To achieve the MBSFN transmission, the following

synchronizations are needed :

- Network synchronization
- eMBMS control plane synchronization
- eMBMS user data synchronization

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Broadcast

This feature impacts downlink throughput for unicast traffic.

Capacity and Performance

The downlink throughput for unicast traffic is decreased according to the number of MBSFN

subframes configured in the MbsfnArea MO.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of LTE Broadcast

To properly configure this feature these guidelines need to be followed.

When configuring the LTE Broadcast feature, consider the following guidelines:

- Maximum eight MbsfnArea MO instances can be enabled at the same time in one baseband.
- Maximum 15 PmchMch MO instances can be enabled at the same time in one baseband.
- It is not possible to have more than eight MbsfnArea.commonSFAllocList items in any cell, summed up from all active MbsfnArea MOs that are connected to this cell. If there is an attempt to activate an MbsfnArea MO in a cell that would break this rule, the MbsfnArea MO will not be activated in this cell and an Inconsistent Configuration alarm for the MbsfnArea MO will be raised.
- If a cell is referenced by an MbsfnAreaCellRelation MO, it is not possible to configure subframes for the cell positioning reference signal. First, the MbsfnAreaCellRelation MO must be removed.
- The subframes that belong to MbsfnArea MO instances cannot overlap with subframes configured for the positioning reference signal.
- Maximum 30 MbmsService MO instances can be enabled at the same time in an eNodeB.
- The configured radio resources must be sufficient for the intended data stream and the bitrate to be indicated in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message for the service.
- Synchronization in the eNodeB must be configured.

To avoid configuration errors, a number of automatic consistency checks are included in

this feature. For more information, see Internal MCE.

For more information about configuring the LTE Broadcast feature, see Manage Bearers and Services.

Channel Bandwith

If 3 MHz bandwidth is used, the following criteria must be taken into

consideration:

- Limit the SI messages size to less than 1208 bits if a maximum of four subframes per radio frame for eMBMS are used and if the EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength parameter is set to 10 ms. If the maximum size of the SI message is 2216 bits, and if at most four subframes per radio frame for eMBMS are used, set the parameter EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength to 20 ms.
- If MbsfnArea.signallingMCS is set to 2 or 7, a small TBS is used. It is then not possible for more than seven MBMS sessions per MBSFN area (max 15 MBMS sessions if MbsfnArea.signallingMCS MO with value 7 is used) to fit the MCCH message into one TB. Additional sessions can still run in parallel by using more than one MBSFN area.

If 5 MHz bandwidth is used, the following criteria must be taken into

consideration:

- Limit the SI messages size to less than 2056 bits if a maximum of four subframes per radio frame for eMBMS are used, and if the parameter EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength is set to 10 ms. If the maximum size of the SI message 2216 bits is used, and if at most four subframes per radio frame for eMBMS are used, set the parameter EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength to 15 ms.
- If MbsfnArea.signallingMCS is set to 2, a small TBS is used. It is then not possible for more than 15 MBMS sessions per MBSFN area to fit the MCCH message into one TB, although additional sessions can still run in parallel by using more than one MBSFN area.

Transport Network Configuration

The Mbms.m1IpInterfaceRef attribute specifies which

InterfaceIPv4 MO orInterfaceIPv6 MO to be

used to configure the IP interface for reception of source specific IP multicast

sessions.

An InterfaceIPv4 MO or InterfaceIPv6 MO must

not be configured as a loopback interface and it must not have encapsulation

reference to an IpsecTunnel MO. These types of interfaces do not

support multicast.

## 9.2 LTE Broadcast Configuration

When LTE Broadcast sessions are planned, MbmsService MOs are

configured and each one has one or several TMGIs.

As it is shown on Figure 1, the

MbmsService MO is associated with a PmchMch MO and an

MbsfnArea MO. Each cell that belongs to an MbsfnArea

is connected by an MbsfnAreaCellRelation MO, which also shows the status of

the MbsfnArea in that cell.

A cell can be configured as a cell reserved for the MbsfnArea MO, which

means that it blocks traffic on the subframes that belong to the MbsfnArea,

but does not contribute to the MBMS transmission. In this cell, SIB2 and SIB13 does not

contain any information about the MBSFN area.

When starting an MBMS session, an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message sent

from the MME to the internal MCE is forwarded to the eNodeB. It contains the TMGI that is used

to identify the MbmsService, PmchMch and

MbsfnArea configurations to be activated.

LTE Broadcast Overview

## 9.3 eMBMS Synchronization

To achieve the MBSFN transmission, network synchronization, eMBMS control plane

synchronization, and eMBMS user data flow synchronization is needed.

Network Synchronization

For information about how to configure network synchronization, see Manage Bearers and Services. Other than that, all members of the

struct in MO parameter EUtranCellFDD.FramestartOffset needs to be set to

0 in all nodes.

The ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationMbms parameter defines the

maximum allowed time and phase deviation of the system clock from the reference clock source

for the eMBMS. Exceeding this threshold determines that eMBMS is disabled and secondary

alarm Service Degraded is raised only in cells carrying eMBMS.

The ENodeBFunction.timePhaseSynchStateMbms parameter indicates if the

time and phase deviation fulfills defined threshold for eMBMS.

eMBMS Control Plane Synchronization

For information about how to configure eMBMS control plane synchronization, see Internal MCE.

eMBMS User Data Flow Synchronization

Synchronized radio interface transmission from cells controlled by different eNodeBs

requires the SYNC protocol over the M1 interface between the BM-SC and the eNodeBs.

As part of the SYNC protocol procedures, the BM-SC includes a time stamp within the SYNC

PDU packets which provides information on the timing, based on which the eNodeB sends eMBMS

data over the air interface. This time stamp is based on a common time reference and common

start of the first synchronization period available at the BM-SC and the concerned eNodeBs,

and represents a relative time value that refers to the start time of the synchronization

period.

The eNodeB must schedule the received data packets in the first MCH Scheduling Period

following the time point indicated by the time stamp.

Based on the parameters in the SYNC PDU packets,

the eNodeB can do the following:

- Derive the timing for downlink radio transmission.
- Determine if any SYNC packets are lost during transmission from BM-SC to the eNodeB and the length field of the lost packets.
- Reorder the PDUs if needed.

If the SYNC protocol delivers more data for an MCH than the air interface can transport in

the scheduling period, packets are dropped by the eNodeB. To decide which packets to drop,

the eNodeB does the following:

- Selects the last bearer, that is the one with the highest logical channel identity according to the order in the MCCH list, with a SYNC PDU packet available for drop.
- For the selected bearer, drops the available SYNC PDU packet with the highest packet number among the SYNC PDU packets with the latest time stamp.

In case of packet loss, the eNodeB mutes the subframes corresponding to the lost packets

within the MSP.

## 9.4 DRX

To save battery time, the Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE feature allows the UEs to

stop monitoring the PDCCH during a certain time period.

Battery time saving depends on the type of traffic and how the function is

configured.

For more information, see Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE.

When LTE Broadcast is running, the DrxProfile.onDurationTimer is set to at

least 3. This means that if DrxProfile.onDurationTimer is

set to less than 3, the value is 3. Additionally,

theDrxProfile.drxInactivityTimer is set to at least 3.

This means that if DrxProfile.drxInactivityTimer is set to less than

3, the value is 3.

When eMBMS is activated and a VoLTE bearer is set up, the system selects the eMBMS VoLTE DRX

profile

(DrxProfile.drxProfileId=18).

The eMBMS VoLTE DRX profile is described in Service Specific DRX.

When the UE has an active PTT bearer, the

mission-critical PTT DRX profile is used. If the UE has a VoLTE bearer along with a

PTT bearer, the mission-critical PTT DRX profile is used.

## 9.5 Admission Control

This feature affects admission by downlink resource utilization on transport network

and dynamic GBR admission for MSR.

The total available system resources for the downlink non-eMBMS traffic are decreased as

resources are used by eMBMS.

- DL GBR PRB utilization per cell
- DL GBR PRB utilization per RBS
- DL GBR SE utilization per cell
- DL GBR SE utilization per RBS
- DL GBR baseband capacity utilization per RBS

See Dynamic GBR Admission Control for detailed information about

monitored system resources.

Engineering Guidelines of LTE Broadcast

## 9.6 Transport Network, IP Multicast

GTP-U multicast tunnels are used for unidirectional transfer of the encapsulated

T-PDUs from one GTP-U tunnel endpoint  to multiple GTP-U tunnel endpoints over the M1

interface.

The starting GTP-U tunnel endpoint acts as an IP multicast source, located in the MBMS GW,

and the target GTP-U tunnel endpoints act as source-specific IP multicast listeners, located

in the eNodeB. GTP-U uses UDP port 2152.

The Common Tunnel Endpoint ID present in the GTP header indicates the tunnel a particular

T-PDU belongs to. The C-TEID value used in the TEID field is allocated at the source tunnel

endpoint (located in the MBMS GW) and is part of the MBMS SESSION START

REQUEST message over the M3 interface. One C-TEID is allocated to each eMBMS bearer

service.

The multicast IP address, the C-TEID, and multicast source IP address

are used to identify the multicast packets to accept and forward to

the LTE application, or which of these to discard.

After reception of MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message, eNodeB joins the specific multicast group if it has not

already joined it. eNodeB then sends periodic reports, as replies

to periodic queries from the IP multicast router during the multicast

session, in order to keep the IP multicast router aware of the continued

interest in receiving packets from the specific multicast group. This

causes the IP multicast session to resume even after link breaks on

the M1 interface.

At the end of the multicast listener session, the eNodeB leaves

the specific multicast group if this session is the last one in the

multicast group.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q1: eMBMS on 3 MHz

The eMBMS on 3 MHz enhancement enables eMBMS deployment with 3 MHz carrier

bandwidth.

| Feature Name:           | LTE Broadcast                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3021 R4                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Broadcast                      |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0420 R4                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement allows the deployment of eMBMS using 3 MHz carrier bandwidth. eMBMS

operates the same way it does on other carrier bandwidths, except that less data can be

sent per each transport block with 3 MHz than with different bandwidths.
