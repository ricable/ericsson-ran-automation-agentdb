Summary

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB is a feature related to load balancing. It is an

enhancement of the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature and contains the following

functionalities:

- The throughput-aware UE selection estimates and compares possible UE throughput in the source cell and potential throughput in the target cell before using a UE for load balancing. A decision on whether to move the UE is based on the throughput difference. Only UEs that have the most benefit or the least performance degradation from being moved are used for load balancing.
- Load balancing is performed at the UE context setup. This replaces the cyclic UE scanning procedure of the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature. Additionally, UEs with long connection times can be evaluated in intervals.

UE throughput awareness in load balancing has the following benefits:

- Performance impact on the individual UE is considered before making a load-balancing decision. This reduces the risk of moving a UE to a cell offering worse UE throughput.
- Average throughput is increased in the system.

The gain is experienced mainly in case the cells on different frequencies are not

co-located.

Load balancing at UE setup has the following benefits:

- The UE is used for load balancing when it has ongoing traffic and before the data transfer ramps up.
- This mitigates the risk of starting inter-frequency measurements in UEs that are inactive and close to a release.

| Inter-Frequency Load Balancing (FAJ 121                                 3009)                            | Prerequisite   | UE Throughput-Aware IFLB is an enhancement to the Inter-Frequency                                 Load Balancing.  Throughput-aware UE selection estimates and                                 compares possible UE throughput in the cell, before using a UE for                                 load balancing. A decision on whether to move the UE or not is based                                 on the throughput difference.  When uplink-heavy UE detection and exclusion are active in a cell,                                 the UE might be moved to a neighbor cell before it is identified as                                 uplink-heavy. If it is detected as uplink-heavy in the serving cell                                 it was moved to, it might be immediately moved back to the source                                 cell. After the last handover, the UE is identified as uplink-heavy                                 and is not chosen for further load-balancing actions as long as it                                 is marked as uplink-heavy. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Network Requirements

When the UE Throughput-Aware IFLB is activated, the number of inter-frequency

measurements increases, see

Feature Operation of UE Throughput-Aware IFLB.

# 3 Feature Operation of UE Throughput-Aware IFLB

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature estimates the possible UE throughput and also

balances load at the setup.

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a valid

license key must be installed and the feature must be explicitly activated by setting a

MOM attribute.

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- A license key must be activated to operate the Inter-frequency Load Balancing feature. Details on the process required to load and activate the license are provided in Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation Codes.
- The cell relations where load balancing is desired must be configured to allow load balancing actions and reporting. The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing parameter is set to ALLOWED in the desired EUtranCellRelation MO.
- Load balancing between cells in different RBS nodes requires an X2 connection between the RBS nodes.

UE Selection at Setup

The feature selects UEs to evaluate for load balancing at Initial UE Context Setup.

If a UE is selected, a measurement for a load balancing target cell is started. The

measurement configuration is done with the same RRC Connection Reconfiguration

message as the default measurements.

Load balancing measurements at UE Context Setup are never configured for:

- UEs where no Initial Context Setup is performed.
- UEs requesting CSFB.
- UEs that have sent MBMS interest indication.

Figure 1   Initial Context Setup with UE Evaluation for Load Balancing

UE Selection at Timeout

Typically UEs are setup and released frequently due to short data sessions and a

short inactivity timer. This makes them regularly evaluated for load balancing.

However, some UEs can have a long connection time, to make these available for load

balancing a new timer, lbUeEvaluationTimer, is defined that is

started at UE Context Setup. When the timer triggers the UE is available as a

candidate for load balancing measurements.

The timer is started for all UEs, those that are selected for evaluation at setup and

those that are dismissed. After a timeout the timer is restarted. The timer is

restarted at incoming handover and RRC Connection Reestablishment.

Load balancing measurements at: lbUeEvaluationTimer timeout are

never configured for:

- UEs in poor or critical coverage, A2 measurement search.
- UEs interested in eMBMS.

Number of UEs Selected for Measurement

Not all initiated UE measurements results in a load balancing action. The UE can for

example find no radio coverage on the target frequency, or the strongest cell

reported by the UE can not be one needing load balancing.

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB introduces an extra restriction - a "throughput filter"

- that a UE needs to pass to be used for load balancing and to be moved to the

target frequency. So, a higher number of UEs need to perform measurements.

To give the operator a tool to impact the number of UEs that are configured with load

balancing measurements, the parameter

EUtranCellFDD.lbTpNonQualFraction or

EUtranCellTDD.lbTpNonQualFraction is introduced. This

parameter represents the wanted fraction of the UEs (in percent) that are

disqualified for load balancing action because the throughput impact for this

individual UE is unacceptable.

Throughput Filter

The key mechanism of the UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature is the throughput filter. A

UE is only used for load balancing in case the estimated potential throughput

impact, comparing the source and the target cell, is acceptable.

Figure 2 gives an overview of the throughput

filter.

Figure 2   Throughput Filter Overview

In the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, at reception of RRC Measurement

Report, a load balancing measurement report evaluation takes place. UE

Throughput-Aware IFLB adds the throughput filter to the following criteria:

- An algorithm estimating the achievable throughput: the throughput in the source cell and potential target cell (that is the best cell reported in the measurement report) is calculated. The algorithm is an equation with UE measurement results (RSRP, RSRQ) and internal parameters as input.
- A throughput based decision based on a ranking procedure takes place. UE rank is calculated and compared to the dynamic ranking threshold. A throughput based decision is made and the UE is qualified for load balancing or it is disqualified. The throughput based decision is described in Throughput Based Load Balancing Decision.
- Update the dynamic ranking threshold. The rank threshold is dynamic and is based on previous throughput evaluation results and operator parameters. The dynamic rank threshold is updated after each UE throughput filter evaluation.

Load balancing handover is not performed for UEs where Service Specific Load

Management prohibits load balancing and UEs where Service or Priority-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Handover measurements are started.

For UEs capable of Carrier Aggregation (CA) throughput estimation is performed in

addition to the existing Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB criteria.

Throughput Estimation

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature predicts the achievable UE throughput in both

the source and the intended target cells before a particular UE can be selected for

load balancing action. This prediction is based on:

- UE measurement reports including RSRP and RSRQ for both source and target cell
- The estimated cell peak throughput for source and target cell
- The traffic load levels in source and target cell

The estimated cell peak throughput considers and adjusts itself for the capacity

assigned to eMBMS, when eMBMS service is active.

A real throughput is however impossible to calculate, because it depends for example

on used application. Instead a "performance value" that can be used for a relative

rating of estimated performance in different cells is used. (The "performance value"

can range widely outside the expected range of the achievable UE throughput in a

cell. However, when used for a relative rating of cells, it is expected to reflect

the performance relation good enough.)

Throughput Based Load Balancing Decision

Based on the performance value in source and target cell a rank value, R, is

calculated for the UE. The rank value is compared to the current rank threshold, Rc.

Ra is the absolute minimum ranking threshold, and Rc is always be larger than Ra.

The purpose of the ranking is to divide the UEs in one fraction that is qualified to

use for load balancing and one fraction that is disqualified. If the UE is qualified

for load balancing the eNodeB attempts to move the UE to the target cell with

Inter-Frequency Handover. If the UE is disqualified for load balancing the UE

remains in the source cell. The UE can be evaluated by the throughput filter again

if it stays connected until the lbUeEvaluationTimer timer

expires.

Figure 3   Example of UE Ranking, Each Dot is a Measurement Report Sent from a

UE

Figure 3 illustrates the ranking mechanism.

When the measurement report is received and the throughput in source and target cell

is estimated, the rank value R, is calculated for this UE.

Basically, rank is a measure for the difference between throughput in source (TPS)

and target (TPT). It is calculated with the following formula:

R=(TPT-TPS+bias)/(TPS+TPT+bias).

This alternative calculation normalize the rank value R, so that it can vary only in

the range from  -1 to +1.

Rank value R=0, see Figure 3, it is a

straight line separating the UEs in two equally big fractions. At rank R=0, the

estimated throughput in source and target is equal and a UE does not gain or loose

anything if it is moved from source to target cell.

The EUtranCellFDD.lbTpNonQualFraction or

EUtranCellTDD.lbTpNonQualFraction MO is introduced, operator

parameter to steer the size of the non-qualified fraction of UEs.

For example, an operator wants to disqualify 1/4 of the UEs for load balancing, the

operator sets the value of EUtranCellFDD.lbTpNonQualFraction or

EUtranCellTDD.lbTpNonQualFraction to 25. This means that the

operator wants to keep the 25% of the UEs (those that benefit the least from being

moved to the target cell) in the source cell. 25% of the UEs are circled in the

lower right part of Figure 3 and the rest of

the UEs, i.e. the 75% that is qualified for load balancing, are circled in the upper

left part of Figure 3. The ranking threshold

Rc, that divides the UEs in the wanted fractions is also shown.

The current ranking threshold Rc, depends on the actual UE population in a cell. The

UE distribution changes continuously because UEs are connected, released and moved

geographically. The value of Rc depends on the values sent in the measurement

reports and is approximated each time instance.

Rc is therefore a dynamic value, that depends on the

EUtranCellFDD.lbTpNonQualFraction or

EUtranCellTDD.lbTpNonQualFraction parameter and the UE

current distribution in the cell. Rc is updated each time a UE is ranked.

In exemption scenarios, in case the distribution of UEs is skewed so that it becomes

difficult to find any UE to use for load balancing, the current Rc value decreases.

To mitigate too low values of Rc, an operator parameter representing an absolute

minimum ranking threshold Ra, is also introduced by the

EUtranCellFDD.lbTpRankThreshMin or

EUtranCellTDD.lbTpRankThreshMin parameters. The dynamic Rc

value is always be larger than Ra, so the UEs with rank below Ra are never used for

load balancing, even if this stalls the load balancing mechanism. The consequence

can be that the fraction of disqualified UEs is larger than

EUtranCellFDD.lbTpNonQualFraction or

EUtranCellTDD.lbTpNonQualFraction if the ranking is poor.

# 4 Network Impact of UE Throughput-Aware IFLB

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature enhances the capacity and performance in two main

aspects: the feature adds throughput awareness and improves the efficiency of load balancing

measurements.

Capacity and Performance

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature is an add-on to the Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing feature which it enhances in two main aspects:

- UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature adds throughput awareness to the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature. This means that only those UEs are moved to the target cell that have the most to gain from it. An overall throughput optimization is achieved.
- The efficiency of load balancing measurements are improved because evaluation for load balancing is done immediately at UE Context Setup. UEs move to a higher degree when data are sent and measurements are unconfigured in UEs before release.

Other Network Elements

The UE Throughput-Aware IFLB feature redistributes users in connected mode between

inter-frequency cells by means of traffic load triggered inter-frequency handover.

More inter-frequency UE measurements are started, but the number of inter-frequency

handovers do not increase. The handover is typically performed in good radio

conditions.
