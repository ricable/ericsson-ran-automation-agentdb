Summary

The feature introduces a method for the estimation of the current capacity of the downlink of

each cell, which is used by load management features to assess the traffic load.

Periodic estimations are performed on the current cell capacity to ensure it is

reliable.

The feature has the following main benefits:

- Reduces the need for manual configuration of cell capacity.
- The cell capacity value is more accurate over time than the fixed predefined value. Note: If a fixed cell capacity value was set manually, it is likely that after cell capacity changes, the previous configuration does not reflect actual cell capacity value.

# 3 Feature Operation of Automated Cell Capacity Estimation

The Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature is a periodic process that outputs cell

capacity estimation. The estimation result is saved in

EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or

EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap attribute for further use.

The feature can be activated at node level. When it is active, it runs in the following

modes:

- Active, and the estimated value is isolated and does not affect any other features.
- Active, and the estimated value is used in load management features

The current cell load, estimated for example in the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, is divided by the

cell capacity and thereby a relative load figure for each cell is calculated and can be

used to determine if load balancing actions must be performed.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. When the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature is activated, the value of attribute EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap is automatically initialized for unlocked cells to the same value as attribute EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity, respectively. The initialization is also done at each cell unlock. The following initial boundary values are also automatically set by this feature: For FDD, EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMaxCellSubCap and EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMinCellSubCap For TDD, EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMaxCellSubCap and EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMinCellSubCap The boundary value can be modified after the feature is activated.
2. The feature estimates the cell traffic and from the cell traffic the cell capacity can be estimated. The feature uses a model for downlink capacity assessment where cell traffic data is collected and calculated to estimate downlink capacity. scale:60 Cell capacity estimation represents an estimated traffic rate when all available resources are supposed to be fully used in the cell. The cell capacity estimation is calculated from the average bit rate divided by average degree of usage, where the average bit rate indicates how many bit rates are used among the number of samples, while the degree of usage indicates how many PRBs are used amongst the available PRBs. There are three parameters, BitRate, UsedPRBs, and AvailablePRBs, and they are periodically and synchronically measured in the cell and accumulated as ΣBitRate, ΣUsedPRBs, and ΣAvailablePRBs respectively during estimation interval. The estimation results output to EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap attributes. The result of the assessment is observed by PM Event INTERNAL\_EVENT\_CELL\_DL\_CAPACITY.

4. Cell capacity estimation is repeatedly performed at variable intervals. This update period is not fixed. The interval is adjusted by the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature according to traffic intensity. Figure 2 Simplified Flow of Cell Capacity Estimation The value of EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap attributes can suddenly become unreasonable because cell resource capacity is radically changed by other features. The Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature can detect this event and immediately make a cell capacity estimation. For example, as soon as the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service function of the LTE Broadcast feature is activated, a number of Physical Radio Blocks become unavailable for downlink traffic. In this case, the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature detects the huge reduction of numbers of available Physical Radio Blocks, and a new cell capacity estimation is instantly performed. Rapid compensation is triggered when the number of available Physical Radio Blocks changes by more than 10%.
5. The EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap attribute represents an estimated cell capacity. To minimize impact on other load management features, a transition step update is introduced that updates this MOM attribute to make the change more smooth. The attribute reaches the final value gradually. The complete transition period is set to 15 minutes, and the time for each transition step is set to 1 minute. Figure 3 Overview of dynCellSubscrCap

7. The operator can choose whether to use Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature in other load management features by setting AutoCellCapEstFunction.useEstimatedCellCap. If the operator chooses to use this feature in load management features, these features use the EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap attribute instead of EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity orEUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity to assess the subscription ratio.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Automated Cell Capacity Estimation

It must be enabled to apply the cell capacity estimation in load management features.

The feature automatically sets boundary values for cell capacity that can also be configured

manually. Manual cell capacity configuration must be reconsidered.

## 9.1 Configuration of Subscription Parameters

In load management features, it is recommended that the subscription parameter values are

selected in proportion to bit rates in kbps. However, since the unit of the

EUtranCellFDD.dynCellSubscrCap or

EUtranCellTDD.dynCellSubscrCap attribute is explicitly defined as kbps,

the configuration principle of these subscription parameters must be changed if the operator

wants to use the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature in other load management features.

In comparison to the load management features, the following recommendations are changed:

- QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta orQciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta parameters for a non-GBR type of E-RAB is chosen to be identical to a value considered as an acceptable downlink bitrate in kbps for UE in connected mode in LTE RAN at high load. For a GBR type of E-RAB is chosen to be identical to the typical guaranteed downlink bitrate in kbps for the particular QCI.
- The general recommendation is to choose a value of parameter EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity identical to the achievable downlink bitrate in kbps in the cell.

Table 4 below shows the example recommendation for

EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity assuming that the downlink

spectrum efficiency is 2.0 bps/Hz for an FDD cell, and the entire downlink bandwidth can be

utilized. In case of TDD, the effective bandwidth is scaled in proportion to how much of the

TDD frame is allocated for downlink.

Table 4   Example Recommendation for cellSubscriptionCapacity

| Duplex   |   Bandwidth (MHz) |   Cell Subscription Capacity |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| FDD      |                20 |                        40000 |
| FDD      |                15 |                        30000 |
| FDD      |                10 |                        20000 |
| FDD      |                 5 |                        10000 |
| TDD      |                20 |                        28000 |
| TDD      |                10 |                        14000 |
| TDD      |                20 |                        20000 |
| TDD      |                10 |                        10000 |

## 9.2 Boundary Configuration

The Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature automatically sets the boundary parameters

EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMaxCellSubCap or

EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMaxCellSubCap and

EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMinCellSubCap or

EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMinCellSubCap to the following initial values if

attribute EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMinMaxWriProt or

EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMinMaxWriProt is set to false:

- EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMinCellSubCap = 0.5 × EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMinCellSubCap = 0.5 × EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity
- EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMaxCellSubCap = 1.5 × EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMaxCellSubCap = 1.5 × EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity

It is possible to modify these boundary parameters manually after the feature is

activated. The EUtranCellFDD.cellCapMinMaxWriProt or

EUtranCellTDD.cellCapMinMaxWriProt attribute must be set to true to keep

these values after activities that require cell lock and unlock.

## 9.3 Use Estimated Cell Capacity in Load Management Features

If the estimated cell capacity is to be used by load management features, attribute

AutoCellCapEstFunction.useEstimatedCellCap, otherwise, the estimated Cell

Capacity is only shown in PM Event INTERNAL\_EVENT\_CELL\_DL\_CAPACITY, and

it has no affect on any other load management features.
