TM8 is a mode which allows transmission of data over two spatial                                 layers. Beamforming can reduce interference and provide improved                                 throughput for cell-edge users.  With the Dual Layer Beamforming Performance Package feature enabled a                                 TM8 capable UE transitions to TM8 after connecting to the cell and                                 remain there. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The TM8 Mode Switching feature is only applicable to the combination of 8Tx TDD cells

configured for TM8, and UEs Release 9 or higher.

# 3 Feature Operation of TM8 Mode Switching

The TM8 Mode Switching feature enables the UE to transit back and forth between TM3 and

TM8 depending on channel quality in order to maximize throughput.

The TM8 Mode Switching feature chooses the optimal transmission mode depending on channel

quality. When the channel quality is good, TM3 is selected, otherwise TM8 is used.

# 4 Network Impact of TM8 Mode Switching

With the TM8 Mode Switching feature better UE throughput performance is achieved over TM8

or TM3 alone.

Capacity and Performance

TM3 is used in good channel conditions to avoid unneeded overhead, and TM8 in average

or poor channel conditions to take advantage of improved signal gain. Because of the

higher signal gain with dual-layer beamforming, TM8 provides better throughput

performance than TM3 for UEs in average or poor channel conditions. However, TM3 has

less overhead than TM8 and therefore it can deliver better throughput performance

than TM8 in good channel conditions.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for TM8 Mode Switching

various transmission modes.
