# 1 Priority Paging Overview

The Priority Paging feature supports the prioritization of paging messages in high-load

situation.

Summary

The Priority Paging feature adds support for prioritization of S1AP paging messages received

from the core network.

The feature extends the paging functionality at the RBS by adding support for the Paging

Priority IE in the S1AP Paging message by performing prioritization of the received

S1AP paging messages.

This feature ensures that S1AP paging messages with higher priority have a higher success rate

than S1AP messages with lower priority. The highest priority corresponds to the

lowest priority number in the Paging Priority IE. For more information about the

overload protection mechanism, see Basic Load Management.

Additional Information

For more information about this feature and related topics, see the following

documentations:

- 3GPP TS 36.300, Overall description; Stage 2
- 3GPP TS 36.304, User Equipment (UE) procedures in idle mode
- 3GPP TS 36.331, Radio Resource Control (RRC), Protocol Specification
- 3GPP TS 36.413, (E-UTRAN); S1 Application Protocol(S1AP)

# 2 Dependencies of Priority Paging

The Priority Paging feature is associated to S1AP paging messages received from the

core network.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

Priority paging messages must be configured in the core network for the feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Priority Paging

In high load situations, where discarding paging messages is necessary, messages with

the highest priority are handled first.

Specific UEs in RRC\_IDLE state about incoming data sessions are notified by the core network

using Paging. The core network only registers that the UE is in the TA (Tracking Area). To

contact the UE, the core network sends S1AP Paging messages to all RBSs that belong to that

TA.

Depending on the core network configuration for priority paging, priority criteria for the

RBS are specified in a Priority Paging IE. This is described in the 3GPP TS

36.413 specification.

At the RBS, the load control and overload protection mechanisms determine if any paging

messages must be discarded. If discards are necessary because of high paging load or high MP

load, the paging messages with highest priority are handled first. For more information about

the overload protection mechanism, see Basic Load Management.

Then, the paging messages are broadcasted to all cells in the TA, in accordance with the

3GPP TS 36.331 specification. The UE sends a Service Request message to the

network which establishes the connection.

## 3.1 High Level Feature Flow

The Priority Paging feature associates the TAC with one of the tracking

areas.

The MME sends S1 Paging messages with different priorities to the eNodeB. Up to eight

levels of priorities are supported.

Figure 1   Paging with Paging Priority in LTE RAN

The flow of paging messages is described in the following steps:

Steps

1. The core network sends S1AP Paging messages to all RBSs in the TA (Tracking Area). The paging messages contain the Paging Priority IE.
2. The RBS receives the S1AP paging messages with priority and performs prioritization. If the messages do not contain the Paging Priority IE, the RBS gives them the lowest priority.
3. The RBS broadcasts the received paging message to all cells belonging to the TA, using RRC Paging as described in the 3GPP TS 36.331 specification.
4. The UE receives the paging message and sends a Service Request to the network to establish a connection.

### 3.1.1 Overload Protection

The Paging Overload Protection mechanism protects the eNodeB against paging overload

scenarios.

The Priority Paging feature improves the overload protection mechanism. The feature uses the

paging priority received in the S1AP paging messages to decide which paging message to be sent

first to the UEs and how many pages are accepted by the system. For more information about

overload protection, see Basic Load Management.

# 4 Network Impact of Priority Paging

Paging discards happens if the paging load is higher than the capacity of the smallest

cell.

Capacity

The Priority Paging feature does not affect the existing RBS capacity.

The paging intensity is limited in the  RBS by a maximum permitted intensity. For the

purpose of tracking area (TA) dimensioning, the average paging intensity must not exceed 90%

of the maximum permitted intensity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of Priority Paging

No parameters are introduced or associated with this feature.

Parameters

This feature has no introduced or associated parameters.

# 6 Performance of Priority Paging

This feature uses KPIs and counters to indicate the number of paging messages that are

received or discarded.

KPIs

| KPI                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# 7 Activate Priority Paging

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011711 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Priority Paging

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011711 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
