# 1 Uplink Interference Reporting Overview

The Uplink Interference Reporting feature is a method for interference

monitoring.

Summary

The eNodeB measures the noise and interference of each receiver antenna branch and

PRB. This feature provides observability for each PRB and antenna branch by

detecting external interference.

External uplink interference degrades performance, particularly in terms of coverage

area and throughput rate. This feature allows for the remote investigation of uplink

interference for each PRB and antenna branch. This improves troubleshooting

possibilities and reduces the need for third party tools to measure

interference.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Uplink Interference Reporting

The Uplink Interference Reporting feature has no dependencies to other features and

functions.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Interference Reporting

Operation of the Uplink Interference Reporting feature, including network configuration

and operation flows.

The Uplink Interference Reporting feature splits the

pmRadioRecInterferencePwrBrPrb1~100 counters from cell level into antenna

branch level, making it possible to detect which specific antenna branch has interference.

The left side of the figure illustrates the

pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb1~100 counters, generated on the cell with

2RX antenna branches. The counters are averaged over the antenna branches in this

example.

The right side shows the pmRadioRecInterferencePwrBrPrb1~100 counters

with the Uplink Interference Reporting feature. This gives more detail so the operator can

correctly identify which PRB and antenna branch has external interference. This is useful

when there is external interference on a particular antenna branch.

right

The time to troubleshoot suspicious cells can be reduced. The operator

can also use this feature to monitor either the static interference

status at initial setup or continuously monitor the dynamic interference

for troubleshooting cells.

The RBS creates a new MO instance for each antenna branch under the

SectorCarrier MO when the feature is activated. The number of new

instances created is the same as the number of antennas in use. The PM counters are reported

to the MO instance corresponding to the antenna branch. The RBS handles MO instances depending

on the cell state.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Interference Reporting

The Uplink Interference Reporting feature can impact the capacity and performance,

depending on the configuration.

Capacity and Performance

Do not use this feature on a large scale in a network. Data volume generated by PM counters

and PM events can be a problem for the collecting node. OSS limitations can also vary based

on OSS configuration and other features active in networks.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
