Summary

The 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature has the following benefits:

- Improved downlink performance in terms of coverage, capacity (bit rate), and throughput, without advanced antenna setup
- Reduced inter-cell interference at the cell edge
- Improved cell throughput

Data on the common channels are transmitted using

Tx

diversity, while for PDSCH the transmission mode is configurable.

The feature supports transmission modes TM3, TM4, and TM9.

In TM3 and TM4, the feature uses UE CSI. In TM9, it uses CSI-RS.

The feature affects downlink scheduling, link adaptation and layer 1 processing.

FDD only

Hardware

Preferably, either one 4TX radio or two 2TX radio units must be used. The use of four

1TX radios is not recommended, because the best performance is not ensured thereby.

However, this setup also works.

Antennas must have four vertical columns. A column consists of either vertical or

diagonal elements (cross-polarized). Columns can either be closely spaced or widely

separated. The best results come from two closely spaced columns (0.5-1 lambda) of

one polarization angle, together with two closely spaced columns of another

polarization angle.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- UE For TM3 and TM4, the UE must support 4-port CRS, TM3, or TM4 up to rank 2. For TM9, the UE must be 3GPP release 12 or later and support TM9 and FGI 103.
- ENM For TM9, ENM 18.6 is required.

# 3 Feature Operation of 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The feature provides support for LTE downlink four-antenna transmission. The feature

uses UE CSI in TM3 and TM4 and CSI-RS in TM9. To ensure support, the feature affects downlink

scheduling, link adaptation, and layer 1 processing.

UE Channel State Information

1. In the downlink, the UE estimates the spatial properties of the radio channel by measuring the downlink reference symbols from the different antenna ports.
2. This is used to give feedback to the eNodeB, so that it allocates an appropriate amount of resources to make an optimal antenna mapping. The feedback can be sent in the following ways: On the PUCCH, if no PUSCH resources are scheduled. On PUSCH, if PUSCH resources are scheduled. To assist link adaptation and scheduling in the downlink, the UE can provide either periodic or aperiodic CSI in TM4, and CSI-RS in TM9.

Downlink Scheduling and Link Adaptation

1. Select a DCI format when a UE is selected for scheduling.
2. Based on the resource allocation types for the DCI format, the downlink scheduler assigns a set of PRB resources to the UE. This set of PRB resources serves as input to the link adaptation function, together with the preferred number of codewords and number of bits for transmission.
3. Link adaptation in the downlink performs transport format selection to enforce the quality requirement, while using the available resources in an efficient way. Transport format selection includes selecting the modulation and coding scheme, and transport block size.
4. After reception, the UE feedbacks separate HARQ acknowledgments for each transmitted codeword.

Layer 1 Processing

The process for each downlink assignment differs depending on the number of codewords in

use.

1. When the downlink scheduler process is finalized, the result is a set of assignments that are provided as input to the layer 1 processing unit.
2. The downlink scheduling assignments are sent to the UE on PDCCH.

The layer mapping and precoding is as follows:

- If the number of codewords is set to one or two, the layer 1 processing-involved layer mapping for spatial multiplexing, and codebook for precoding and CSI reporting are as described in sections 6.3.3.2 and 6.3.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 36.211.
- The output after mapping codewords to layers and precoding comprises four sequences of complex value symbols mapped to resource elements for transmission on antenna ports 0, 1, 2, and 3.

# 4 Network Impact of 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The increased spatial diversity and better radio beamforming enabled by four-way transmission

results in higher cell throughput and coverage.

Capacity and Performance

The feature provides capacity gain. The downlink aggregate cell throughput and cell-edge

user throughput are improved compared to that of two-antenna systems.

If TM9 is enabled, downlink UE throughput and downlink peak rate are decreased for

TM9-capable UEs when reconfigured from TM4 to TM9. This is due to CSI-RS used for TM9.

Coverage

The feature increases coverage due to increased spatial diversity, and better radio

beamforming.

Implementation

The feature supports both TM3 and TM4.

The feature supports TM9, and switching between TM9 and TM4.

|-----------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ENodeBFunction.extendMixedTxModeEnabled | Affecting | If the value of this attribute is set to true, not only TM3 but                 TM2 or TM4, can be applied to 2TX TDD and 4TX TDD cells that coexist with TM3, TM7,                 or TM8 8TX TDD cells.                                                                                                                                                            |
| EUtranCellFDD.csiRsConfigType           | Affecting | For TM9, switching EUtranCellFDD.csiRsConfigType from                   NZP_CSIRS to NZP_ZP_CSIRS configuration                 reduces the interference to the CSI-RS in neighboring cells. However, the switching                 results in fewer available resource elements for PDSCH.                                                                          |
| EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth        | Affecting | For TM9, the attribute must be set to 5 MHz or larger. Because TM9 cannot be                 enabled in cells with bandwidth smaller than or equal to 5 MHz, as smaller bandwidth                 do not allow for sufficient SI message allocation.                                                                                                                 |
| EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength            | Affecting | For TM9, the attribute must be set to 10 ms or longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode          | Affecting | For TM9, the attribute must be set to TRANSMISSION_MODE_9.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas            | Affecting | With a parameter value of 0, the installed licensed feature combination for                 multiple antennas defines the configuration and the number of used TX antennas. If                 the parameter value is set to four, and the 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance                 Package feature is enabled, the number of used TX antennas is four. |

| DL PDCP UE Throughput   | Measurable downlink throughput gain is expected with this feature in TM3 and TM4                   compared to 2TX TM3.  It is preferable to measure the PM counters in networks with high traffic                   activity, and compare calculated downlink UE throughput to the performance                   achieved by 2TX TM3 under the same conditions.  Negative impact on the KPIs is not expected where there is no relation to                   downlink throughput.  In TM9, the downlink peak rate is expected to be reduced compared to TM4. This is                   due to the use of CSI-RS in TM9. |
| DL PDCP Cell Throughput | In TM3, TM4, and TM9, the performance of the feature can be observed using KPIs                   of downlink PDCP cell throughput gain.  Negative impact on the KPIs is not expected where there is no relation to                   downlink throughput.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Mobility Success Rate   | Increased Mobility Success Rate is expected with this feature in TM3 and TM4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# 7 Activate 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- Four transmit antenna branches (RF Branches) are configured. If RfBranchId ends with string "\_NO\_TX", the RfBranch must not be used for downlink transmission, even though it can be TX-capable. More information is found in Configuration Files and Preparing Configuration File Templates.
- The network is in Synchronous network operation mode. This is usually the default.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011427 MO instance.
2. Set SectorCarrier.noOfTxAntennas to 0 or 4.
3. Set EUtranCellFDD.transmissionMode to a supported value. If TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9 is selected, the following setting is required: EUtranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth must be set to 5 MHz or larger. EUtranCellFDD.siWindowLength must be set to 10 ms or longer. Note: The benefit of TM9 is the possibility of measuring on different individual antennas using CSI-RS and providing PMI reports for those measurements.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011427 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

The 4x2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature requires or recommends the

following configurations for optimal functioning.

## 9.1 Radio Building Block Configuration

The RBB defines a unique way of combining internal radios or external radios in one

sector with connections to Baseband units and the antenna system.

The RBB configurations that support four-way transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing

are listed in Radio Node Configurations, or for Baseband-based nodes in Manage Radio Network, and in Manage Bearers and Services. The cabling is described in

Antenna and RF Connections.

## 9.2 Baseband Configuration

A Baseband unit provides the following functions:

- switching
- traffic management
- timing
- baseband processing
- radio interfacing

Cell configuration limitations with different types of Baseband units for this feature

are described in Manage Radio Network and Manage Bearers and Services.

The following documents provide further information about the Baseband configuration:

- Baseband Description
- Control Channel Dimensioning

## 9.3 Recommended Configurations for 4TX Diversity

The following antenna types and configurations can be used for 4-way TX Diversity:

- Four co-polarized correlated antenna elements
- Four co-polarized uncorrelated antenna elements
- Two columns of closely spaced cross-polarized antenna elements
- Two spatially separated columns of cross-polarized antenna elements

The recommended configuration depends on the transmission mode (TM3 or TM4), and the

number of UEs moving at medium or high speed, as there is a fundamental trade-off among

the following:

- maximizing beamforming gain
- maximizing diversity gain
- maximizing robustness against fading

For an antenna configuration already deployed with configuration B, C, or D, the cost of

physically changing the antenna configuration may outweigh the marginal performance

benefit that may arise from that antenna optimization effort. Therefore, customers may

need to perform some field testing to assess the cost versus benefit of different

antenna configurations.

For the cases of four antennas from separate radio units, or two dual-TX radios with

different polarization for the two ports on the same radio unit, there should be

benefits from the increased output power. Statistically, additional improvements are

expected due to beamforming.

## 9.4 Engineering Guidelines for Switching from 2TX to 4TX Deployment

General Guidelines for Switching from 2TX to 4TX Deployment

When switching from 2TX to 4TX deployment, it is necessary to retune the following

configurations:

- Enumeration CfiMode For the same cell power and CRS scaling, the measured RSRP at a given location in the configured cell is lowered by 3 dB going from 2TX to 4TX. This is because of the way RSRP is defined by the 3GPP standard. The change in RSRP levels requires the retuning of HO thresholds. To maintain the HO boundary, it is necessary to adjust the CRS scaling, that is, crsGain, as to be explained. Consider setting enumeration CfiMode to 4 or 5. This helps mitigate the fact that there are fewer CCEs for PDCCH with 4TX compared to 2TX, since the introduction of 2 extra CRSs comes at the expense of RE available for PDCCH and PDSCH. The crsGain setting does not change the RSRP level and CRS interference level in the same way.
- CRS scaling
- Handover (HO) thresholds (qRxLevMin, A1/A2/A5/B2 thresholds)

These settings can have been optimized for 2TX, but are not necessarily optimal for

4TX.

Basically, it is in general difficult to maintain RSRP parity and CRS interference

parity simultaneously going from 2TX to 4TX, a trade-off has to be made. If the

cluster is not coverage limited, one can maintain CRS interference parity.

Otherwise, one can maintain RSRP parity. All of those need to be considered in the

performance comparison.

Example 1

If we maintain the same crsGain and cell power, from 2TX to 4TX,

the change in RSRP is -3.01dB but the change in CRS interference is only -1.25dB.

The reason for the discrepancy of 3.01 - 1.25 = 1.76dB is due to the RS power

spectral density being halved from 2TX to 4TX. However, the number of RS resource

elements increased 1.5 times rather than in a two-fold manner, because antenna ports

2 and 3 have half the number of RS REs, as compared to antenna ports 0 and 1. In

case of one PRB, 16 REs are used for CRS in 2TX (8 from port 0 and 8 from port 1),

while there are 24 REs used for CRS in 4TX (8 from port 0, 8 from port 1, 4 from

port 2 and 4 from port 3). The resulting total CRS power of 4TX is 1.76 dB

(10log(24/16)) higher than the total CRS power of 2TX. For details on the CRS RE

locations, see Figure 6.10.1.2-1 in TS36.211 (v14.2.0).

Example 2

Assume that 2TX deployment was with crsGain= 0. For 4TX

deployment. If crsGain setting = 0 is kept, the 4TX RSRP is

3.01dB lower than the 2TX RSRP, and 4TX CRS interference is 1.25dB lower than the

2TX counterpart.

Example 3

Assume that 2TX deployment was with crsGain= 0. If the same HO

boundary as before is to be kept, there can be a need to increase

crsGain by 300. So, it is possible to set 4TX

crsGain to 300. In that case, the 4TX RSRP relative to 2TX

RSRP is only -0.01dB. However, 4TX CRS interference is 1.75dB higher than the 2TX

counterpart, which has negative impact on the 4TX throughput.

Example 4   Assume that 2TX deployment was with crsGain= 0. If 4TX

crsGain is set to 177 to reduce CRS interference to be 0.52dB

higher than the 2TX counterpart, the 4TX RSRP is still 1.24dB lower than the 2TX RSRP,

impacting the HO boundary.

Deployment Scenarios for 4TX with Doubled Cell Power

To analyze the resulting performance gain, view this deployment as a two-step

solution:

1. Upgrade from 2TX to 4TX with the same cell power.
2. Change the configuration to double the cell power, but keep all other settings unchanged.

## 9.5 Baseband Port to RF Branch Mapping with Same Polarization

Baseband port to RF branch mapping is chosen depending on performance requirements.

Field testing is recommended to decide which configuration provides the best

performance.

When using two columns of cross-polarized antennas, for example, +45 and -45, the first and

second Baseband ports can be mapped with the same polarization or with different

polarization.

Mapping with the same polarization provides higher beamforming gain for PDSCH in TM4 and,

therefore, higher cell throughput. When using this radio configuration, the following mapping

applies:

- The first and second RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to antennas with the same polarization, for example, -45.
- The third and fourth RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to other antennas with different polarization, for example, +45.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show an equipment configuration example with one

radio unit with RBB44\_1D and antenna physical cabling ABB4\_1A.

The order of SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute and

SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef is the following in case of ABB4\_1A cabling

pattern:

1. RfBranch 1 connecting to RfPort A and antenna port (A, -45)
2. RfBranch 3 connecting to RfPort C and antenna port (B, -45)
3. RfBranch 2 connecting to RfPort B and antenna port (A, +45)
4. RfBranch 4 connecting to RfPort D and antenna port (B, +45)

The order of SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute and

SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef is the following in case of ABB4\_1B cabling

pattern:

1. RfBranch 1 connecting to radio unit 1 RfPort A and antenna port (A, -45)
2. RfBranch 2 connecting to radio unit 1 RfPort B and antenna port (B, -45)
3. RfBranch 3 connecting to radio unit 2 RfPort A and antenna port (A, +45)
4. RfBranch 4 connecting to radio unit 2 RfPort B and antenna port (B, +45)

Deterministic carrier allocation (DCA) is used if the order of the branches is important to

the Baseband algorithm. With DCA, the Baseband algorithm does not try to re-allocate the

carrier branches if the requested resources are unavailable or already in use. For more

information about DCA, see Features for Radio Configurations in the Radio Node

Configurations library.

For more information about configuration methods, see Manage Hardware Equipment in the Baseband Radio

Node library.

## 9.6 Baseband Port to RF Branch Mapping with Different Polarization

Baseband port to RF branch mapping is chosen depending on performance requirements.

Field testing is recommended to decide which configuration provides the best

performance.

When using two columns of cross-polarized antennas, for example, +45 and -45, the first

and second Baseband ports can be mapped with the same polarization or with different

polarization.

Mapping with different polarization provides higher diversity gain for common channels

which benefits UEs located on the cell edge. When using this radio configuration, the

following mapping applies:

- The first and second RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to antennas with different polarization.
- The third and fourth RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to other antennas with different polarization.

## 9.7 Recommended RF Cable Lengths for TM3 and TM4

It is recommended to use RF cables of equal length to connect the radio to the antenna.

This is to avoid introducing differential delays between the different antennas.

Alternatively, it is possible to use RF cables of unequal length, but in this case

potentially different RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay values have to be

managed on a per RfBranch basis. To ensure correct delay compensation

for each TX antenna, RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay settings have to be set

accurately to reflect the installed RF cables between the radio and the antenna.

Various transmission modes react differently to RF cable length. See Table 10 for reference:

Table 10   TM3 and TM4 RF Cable Length Sensitivity

| Transmission Mode   | Sensitivity to RF Cable Lenth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TM3                 | Not sensitive to RF cables with unequal length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| TM4                 | It is recommended to use the attribute                                     RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay to compensate for the                                 length difference between the RF cables in a way that the length                                 difference in time is within 1 ns for all channel bandwidth. |

Example 5   Configuring RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay to Compensate for RF Cable

Propagation Delay

If the RF cable for antenna 0 is 2 meters, and the RF cables for other antennas are 1

meter, the RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay setting for antenna 0, 1, 2,

and 3 should be set to 8 ns, 4 ns,

4 ns, and 4 ns respectively. This

is to indicate that the antenna 0 path has an extra delay of 4 ns, as compared to

other antenna paths. Once set, all these delays are compensated in order to ensure

that the TX signals to all the antenna elements exhibit the correct downlink timing.

Here, we assume a propagation delay of 4 ns per meter.
