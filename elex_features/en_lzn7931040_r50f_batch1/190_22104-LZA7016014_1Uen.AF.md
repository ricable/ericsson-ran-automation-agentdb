Summary

The UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature has the following benefits:

- Lower battery consumption for the devices using the PFT protocol.
- Efficient PUCCH resource use by allowing UE-Assisted Out-of-Sync transitions.

This feature provides a supported UE with the opportunity for further

battery savings through the following methods:

- The UE can request a fast transition to Out-of-Sync state if the UE determines that the data is delay-tolerant.
- The UE can request an early RRC Connection Release if it determines that no further data exchange is expected.
- The UE can request the DRX inactivity timer to be stopped, and the UE goes to DRX sleep.

When supported UEs make a fast transition to Out-of-Sync, or perform an early RRC Connection

Release, they release their PUCCH resources, allowing for other UEs to acquire them.

This can result in increased subscriber capacity.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Only FDD is supported.

Network Requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX

The UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature implements a PFT protocol between the UE and

eNodeB.

This PFT protocol applies only to those UE vendors who have implemented it.

The EUtranCellFDD.enableUeAssistedAdaptiveDrx attribute needs to be set to

true to enable the feature on a cell.

# 4 Network Impact of UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX

Using the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature can result in increased RACH load, and

increased latency.

Capacity and Performance

A PFT UE can choose a DRX profile with a long DRX sleep time, that results in increased

latency. PFT UEs can transition more frequently between Out-of-Sync and In-Sync states,

which can lead to an increased RACH load.

Interfaces

PFT UEs that trigger an early RRC Connection Release can increase RRC and S1 signaling

loads.

Other Network Elements

The UE supporting the feature can request the eNodeB to release it faster if the following

conditions apply:

- The feature is active.
- There is no activity in the application layer.

This results in the following conditions:

- The UE stays in idle mode longer, thus saving UE battery life.
- The number of paging increases. This can also cause a corresponding increase in the S1 paging discard rate.

# 5 Parameters for UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX

The UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX feature introduces the

EUtranCellFDD.enableUeAssistedAdaptiveDrx configuration parameter. The

Prescheduling feature has parameters that affect the UE-Assisted Adaptive DRX

feature.
