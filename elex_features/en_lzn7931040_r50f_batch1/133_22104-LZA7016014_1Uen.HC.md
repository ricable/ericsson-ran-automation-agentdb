Summary

The Shared LTE RAN feature enables up to six operators with up to six PLMNs to share an LTE

RAN. Without the feature, a PLMN consists of a RAN and a core network, through which

one operator provides services to its subscribers, while subscribers of other

operators can only receive services as national or international roamers.

The Shared LTE RAN feature supports the following configurations:

| GWCN                     |    | Both the eNodeB and the MME are shared by two or more operators. All 								the cells and frequencies are shared.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| MOCN as MORAN            |    | Two or more operators share one eNodeB, but non-shared cells can 								be enabled by network configuration (dedicated frequency for each 								operator). The primary PLMN ID is defined on node level.                                                                                          |

| MORAN on Single Baseband |    | Allows propagation of primary PLMN IDs that are defined on cell 								level. Cells with configured primary PLMN IDs are called MORAN 								cells. In addition to the node-level primary PLMN ID, up to two 								different cell-level primary PLMNs can be defined on the same 								eNodeB. |

These configurations are standardized scenarios for network sharing as described in 3GPP

TS23.251.

The Shared LTE RAN feature allows resource sharing between operators. For the feature

to operate S1/X2 connection handling, system information broadcast and mobility needs to be

changed.

The following areas are changed to support shared LTE RAN:

- S1/X2 Connection Handling
- System Information Broadcast
- Mobility

## 3.2 S1/X2 Connection Handling to Support Shared LTE RAN

Since up to six operators (PLMNs) can share an LTE RAN, PLMN handling is important to provide

correct PLMN information in the following scenarios:

- Besides the primary PLMN, an additional PLMN list can be configured for each cell. The additional PLMN list must be the same for all cells in the node belonging to the same tracking area. If the ENodeBFunction.allowMocnCellLevelCommonTac attribute is set to true it is possible to set different values to EUtranCellTDD.additionalPlmnList and to EUtranCellFDD.additionalPlmnListin each cell for cells belonging to the same tracking areas. The primary PLMN and the additional PLMN lists are sent to the MME in the S1AP S1 SETUP REQUEST. If the shared network support service state is INOPERABLE, only the primary PLMN is valid to be used.
- The eNodeB supports multiple served PLMNs, served MME GroupIDs, and served MMECs for both LTE and other RATs. It is supported if they are received in the S1AP S1 SETUP RESPONSE and S1 MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message. Note: The non-LTE MME GroupID is ignored.
- If the eNodeB is configured with MORAN on single Baseband, X2-C connections can be established for each primary PLMN. For more information on the supported X2-C configurations in this scenario, see Supported X2-C and EN-DC X2-C Configurations for eNodeBs Configured as MORAN on Single Baseband.

PLMN Concept and Identity Relations

## 3.3 SIB1 to Support Shared LTE RAN

The SIB1 contains information relevant when evaluating whether

a UE is allowed to access a cell and defines the scheduling of other

system information.

For each own cell, the SIB1 can include more than one PLMN and it must include all Active

PLMNs. The Primary PLMN must always be broadcasted in the SIB1. This is because it is used to

construct the CGI used by the UE to identify the cell. If the Primary PLMN is excluded as the

Active PLMN, the Primary PLMN is marked as Reserved for operator

use in the SIB1.

The broadcast of

reserved primary PLMNs can be avoided if MORAN on single Baseband is configured. The

cell-level configured primary PLMN overrides the node-level primary PLMN. In this case, the

SIB1 broadcasts only the cell-defined primary PLMN.

## 3.4 Mobility to Support Shared LTE RAN

### 3.4.1 HRL Concept

The HRL is an IE in various S1AP and X2AP messages.

The HRL consists of the following information:

- Serving PLMN
- Equivalent PLMNs
- Forbidden tracking areas: Forbidden tracking areas is a list of TAIs in the E-UTRAN that are forbidden for the UE. The UE is not allowed to connect to a cell with the TAI on the list.
- Forbidden location areas: Forbidden location areas is a list of location area identifiers in any other RAT that is forbidden for the UE. The UE is not allowed to connect to a cell with the location area identifiers on the list.
- Forbidden IRATs: Forbidden IRATs indicate if one or several RATs are forbidden for the UE. The UE is not allowed to connect to a cell of the indicated RATs.
- Forbidden core network types (CNTypeRestrictions): Forbidden PLMN of a core network indicates that a UE is forbidden to connect that core network.
- Forbidden 5G system (NRrestrictionin5GS): Restricts the UE from connecting to an NR network.

The HRL IE exists in the following S1AP and X2AP messages.

- S1AP: INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
- S1AP: DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
- S1AP: HANDOVER REQUEST
- X2AP: HANDOVER REQUEST
- X2 SgNB: ADDITION REQUEST
- X2 SgNB: MODIFICATION REQUEST

The purpose of HRL is to let eNodeB appropriately select target cells for future handovers,

and to select the target SgNB cell. The

HRL is applied to avoid that the UE connected to a PLMN (belonging to one operator) is handed

over to a cell that is not connected to that PLMN, or any associated equivalent PLMN (other

irrelevant operator).

The HRL is stored in the UE context and used for both measurement

selection and handover evaluation.

In accordance with standards: If the HRL is not contained in the S1AP and X2AP messages, the

target eNodeB considers that no access restriction applies to the UE.

### 3.4.2 Admission Control for Handover

In the Shared LTE RAN feature, admission control is performed based

on served PLMN in the HRL. This is done in the target cell for S1

handover, X2 handover, and intra-eNodeB handover.

The admission control algorithm is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2   Admission Control for Handover in Shared LTE RAN

PLMN Concept and Identity Relations

### 3.4.3 Mobility Candidate Selection

Mobility candidate selection determines a set of frequencies in LTE or other RATs, to

which the connected UE can be transferred when it encounters poor coverage in the current

cell.

The following features provide the UE transfer mechanism:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity
- NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

In the Shared LTE RAN feature (supporting multiple PLMNs), different

UE are connected to networks belonging to different operators. To

avoid UE belonging to one operator being redirected or handed over

to another operator network, an Allowed PLMN list is added to each

frequency relation MO for all RATs. The Allowed PLMN list consists

of 0 up to 15 PLMNs. If the list is empty, the frequency relation

is allowed for UE belonging to any PLMN. If the list contains at least

one PLMN, the frequency relation is only allowed for UE that has at

least one of the listed PLMN as serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN in

the HRL. The PLMN that can be included in the allowedPlmnList must be possible to find on cells on that frequency. Forbidden IRAT

IE in the HRL is also checked to remove the indicated RATs.

This is also valid for blind release with direct and blind handover.

Related reference

PLMN Concept and Identity Relations

### 3.4.4 Handover Evaluation

When the UE reports that it has found a set of suitable cells based on the measurements, a

handover evaluation is executed.

By an intra-LTE handover, the handover evaluation decides whether a reported cell is suitable

for the UE. The TAI of the target cell is compared with the Forbidden TAIs in HRL. If all

reported cells are forbidden for the UE, the report is discarded. If it is still valid, the

target cell PLMN or PLMN list is compared with the UE serving PLMN and Equivalent PLMNs. If

there is a match between them, the best cell is selected as target cell.

In the Shared LTE RAN feature, since X2 handover signaling is only

allowed if the eNodeBs are connected to the same MME pool. The target

eNodeB MME pools must be compared with the UE serving MME before X2

handover is selected instead of S1 handover. If the target eNodeB

is not connected to the MME pool to which the UE serving MME belongs,

X2 handover is not allowed.

### 3.4.5 IdleModeMobilityControlInfo Handling

An IdleModeMobilityControlInfo parameter IE can be included in the RRC

CONNECTION RELEASE message. The IE is included only in the following cases:

- When there is a difference between the default configuration on the node (sent in SIB) and the SPID configuration for the UE.
- In shared network, when an HRL is configured on MME for certain PLMNs, frequencies, RATs, or LAs.

The IdleModeMobilityControlInfo parameter IE consists of a list of

frequencies for different RATs. Each frequency has a priority used by the UE to select which

frequencies and in which order it searches for new cells.

Without this feature, the IdleModeMobilityControlInfo parameter is

identical for all UE.

In the Shared LTE RAN feature, the IdleModeMobilityControlInfo parameter

is based on the allowed PLMN List. First, decide which frequency relations are allowed for a

certain RAT, based on the criteria stated for measurement selection. Second, for the allowed

frequency relations, find the corresponding cell reselection priority based on the

EUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority parameter in the MOM. If the

maximum number of frequencies in accordance with 3GPP is exceeded, the lists are

truncated.

In case of E-UTRAN, the maximum number of frequencies is eight if UE is compliant

with 3GPP release less than 12. If UE is compliant with release 12 or above,

the maximum number of frequencies is 15.

### 3.4.6 Cell Selection at EN-DC Setup and Mobility

The primary eNodeB considers the UE PLMN ID and mobility restrictions when selecting

target cell for EN-DC.

Cell Selection at EN-DC Setup

During EN-DC setup, the primary eNodeB always performs validation of the

following:

- If B1 measurement is received during a handover, the frequency of the measurement is checked. The GUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute must contain the serving PLMN or any equivalent PLMN in the Handover Restriction List (HRL).
- The EUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList or the EUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute must contain the serving PLMN or any equivalent PLMN in the HRL.
- The HRL contains UE that is allowed for EN-DC, based on PLMN. Note: If the HRL does not exist, there is no restriction.

For the configuration-based cell setup, the primary eNodeB checks the following:

- The configured target cell has a Tracking Area (TA) that is not forbidden in the UE HRL. Note: If the target cell has forbidden TA, measurement-based cell setup is started.

For the measurement-based cell setup, the primary eNodeB performs the NR B1

measurement.

- The primary eNodeB checks if the ExternalGUtranCell.plmnIdList or the ExternalBroadcastPlmnInfo.pLMNIdList attributes of the target cell contains the serving PLMN or the equivalent PLMN from the HRL.
- The primary eNodeB selects frequencies on which it checks for the GUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList attribute containing the serving PLMN or any equivalent PLMN in the HRL.
- Based on the B1 measurement report, the primary eNodeB selects a secondary gNodeB and checks if the best cell has a TA that is not forbidden. If the TA of the best cell is forbidden, and if there are more frequencies in the measurement report, then the best cell on the next frequency is evaluated. The evaluation of possible cells continues until a cell with allowed TA is found, or all possible cells are evaluated.

Cell Selection at PSCell Change

The primary eNodeB performs the following validations during PSCell change:

- The ExternalGUtranCell.plmnIdList or the ExternalBroadcastPlmnInfo.pLMNIdList attribute of the target cell has to contain the serving PLMN or the equivalent PLMN from the HRL.
- The ExternalGUtranCell.configuredTAC attribute of the target cell has to contain a TAI that is not forbidden.Note: If the ExternalGUtranCell.configuredTAC attribute does not exist, there is no restriction.

## 3.5 Multiple IP addresses to Support Shared LTE RAN

The eNodeB can share up to 6 PLMNs by the Shared LTE RAN feature.

It is possible to configure the following interfaces and addresses separately for each

PLMN, for details see Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2:

- S1 SCTP Endpoint
- X2 SCTP Endpoint
- S1 User Plane IP address
- X2 User Plane IP address
- DnsResolver

The configuration for Additional PLMNs is optional. The common configuration is used

together if there is no configuration for Additional PLMNs.

PLMN Concept and Identity Relations

## 3.6 Supported Configuration and Limitations

The Shared LTE RAN feature supports different network configurations with the following

limitations:

- The maximum number of different PLMNs for each cell is 6.
- The maximum number of different PLMNs for each TAC is 6.
- The maximum number of different PLMNs for each eNodeB is 6.
- The Node primary PLMN can be excluded from broadcasting on cell level only with a MORAN on a single Baseband configuration.
- Additional PLMNs can be excluded from broadcasting only in a MORAN on a single Baseband and in a MOCN as MORAN using MOCN on cell-level configuration.
- Intra-eNodeB handovers are not supported if a change in the MME pool is required. Therefore, the mobile network, including the EPC configuration, must be set up to prohibit such handovers. Note: Restrictions on HRL can be applied to prohibit intra-eNodeB handovers that require a change in the MME pool when the eNodeB is configured with different sets of PLMNs in its cells. In that case, the HRL configured and sent by the EPC to the eNodeB must adhere to one of the following rules: In configurations other than GWCN, the HRL is configured without the allowed PLMNs of neighboring cells that are served by another MME pool connected to the same eNodeB. This means that the target cell PLMN is not on the list of the equivalent PLMNs. In configurations other than GWCN, the HRL is configured with a forbidden TAI that matches the TAI of the neighboring cell. The TAI consists of the target cell PLMN and the TAC. The neighboring cell is managed by another MME pool connected to the same eNodeB. In the case of GWCN configuration, the HRL is configured with the allowed PLMNs of neighboring cells served by the same MME pool of the GWCN connected to the same eNodeB. This means that the target cell PLMN is included in the list of the equivalent PLMNs.

The following additional configuration limitations

apply for eNodeBs configured with MORAN on a single Baseband:

- Separate eNodeB IDs for each operator are not supported. The ENodeBFunction.eNBId attribute is shared by all operators. However, guest operators must not reuse the ENodeBFunction.eNBId attribute in their own RAN. This is done to avoid conflicts because of the dynamically created global eNodeB IDs. The global eNodeB ID consists of the operator PLMN ID and the eNodeB ID.
- Up to two cell-defined PLMNs and one node-level primary PLMN can be configured for an eNodeB within MORAN on a single Baseband.
- Only non-shared cells can be configured with cell-defined primary PLMNs. Such cells do not have an additional PLMN list, and the AdditionalCoreNetwork.plmnList attribute must have the same value as the cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute.
- Cells configured with node-defined primary PLMNs must have all PLMNs defined under the same MME pool and under the same local SCTP endpoint.
- GWCN configurations are not supported.
- If the value of the cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute is defined, the pre-conditions for the EN-DC setup between the eNodeB and the gNodeB must be manually configured.

### 3.6.1 MOCN Configuration

Shared LTE RAN enables sharing of radio resources in eNodeB. A cell can be shared between

up to six PLMN and all the cells must have the same additional PLMN list.

Example 3   Basic MOCN Configuration

If all cells have same additional PLMN lists, all cells can belong to the same

tracking area.

Tracking Area 1:

| Cell A   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |
|----------|----|-------------------------------------------------------|
|          |    |                                                       |
| Cell B   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |
|          |    |                                                       |
| Cell C   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |

Example 4   MOCN with Cell-Based MOCN with Common Tracking Area Code

If ENodeBFunction.allowMocnCellLevelCommonTac parameter is set to

FALSE (by default), cells must be in different tracking area

when having different additional PLMN lists.

Tracking Area 1:

| Cell A   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |
|----------|----|-------------------------------------------------------|
|          |    |                                                       |
| Cell B   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |

Tracking Area 2:

Example 5   MOCN with Cell-Based MOCN with Common Tracking Area Code

If ENodeBFunction.allowMocnCellLevelCommonTac parameter is set to

TRUE, cells can have different additional PLMN list within the

same tracking area.

Tracking Area 1:

| Cell A   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |
|----------|----|-------------------------------------------------------|
|          |    |                                                       |
| Cell B   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1, PLMN2   |
|          |    |                                                       |
| Cell C   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNSs: PLMN1         |

### 3.6.2 MOCN as MORAN

MOCN as Multi-Operator RAN (MORAN) is a setup with a single Baseband unit using

Shared LTE RAN feature contrary to the MORAN feature which requires two Baseband units that

belong to different operators. The setup enables shared cells to behave like non-shared

cells (cells are reserved only for one operator).

Tracking Area 2:

MOCN as MORAN configuration is unsupported if

ENodeBFunction.allowMocnCellLevelCommonTac is set to

TRUE.

Tracking Area 1:

| Cell A   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1                                        |
|----------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          |    |                                                                                     |
| Cell B   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN1                                        |
|          |    |                                                                                     |
| Cell C   |    | Primary PLMN: PLMN0  Additional PLMNs: PLMN2  Cell reserved for operator use: PLMN0 |

### 3.6.3 MORAN on Single Baseband

The MORAN on single Baseband configuration can replace the MOCN as MORAN

configuration to avoid UE idle mode and connected mode mobility issues caused by reserved

primary PLMN IDs.

Example 8   MORAN Cell Using Cell-Defined Primary PLMN ID

Tracking Area 1:

Tracking Area 2:

In this example, Cell A broadcasts PLMN0, which is the primary PLMN. This PLMN

matches the ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId attribute. Additional

PLMNs can be configured for the cell. These configured additional PLMNs must belong

to the same MME pool as the primary PLMN. Cell B only broadcasts PLMN1, which is the

cell-defined primary PLMN.

The forbidden TAI prohibits the UE from performing unwanted handovers to certain

cells. This way, the mobility of the UE is controlled. The HRL must be used and

configured in the core network in the following way:

- TAI = PLMN1 + TAC2 prohibits a UE that belongs to PLMN0 from performing handover to Cell B.
- TAI = PLMN0 + TAC1 prohibits a UE that belongs to PLMN1 from performing handover to Cell A.
- TAI = PLMN3 + TAC1 prohibits a UE that belongs to PLMN1 from performing handover to Cell A.

#### 3.6.3.1 Supported X2-C and EN-DC X2-C Configurations for eNodeBs Configured as MORAN on Single Baseband

If the eNodeB is configured with MORAN on single Baseband in the Shared LTE RAN

feature, X2-C links can be established for each primary PLMN.

Supported X2 configurations are based on X2-C separation. Up to three

child TermPointToENB MO instances can represent up to three potential

X2-C connections towards the same remote shared eNodeB.

One potential XC-2 connection is created for each

of the following local eNodeB primary PLMN IDs that match the active PLMN IDs on the

remote shared eNodeB:

- ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId
- EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId
- EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId

Table 3 shows the scenarios in which X2-C

links can be established between an eNodeB configured with MORAN on single Baseband and

neighbor eNodeBs and gNodeBs.

Table 3   Supported X2-C Configurations

In case of a shared neighbor eNodeB, up to three

TermPointToENB MOs can be used in the eNodeB, instead of one, if

the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The Shared LTE RAN feature is activated.
- The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature is activated.
- The ENodeBFunction.moranOnSingleBbEnabled is set to TRUE.

In an EN-DC deployment with a

MORAN on single Baseband configuration, X2-C links can be configured for each Master

Node based on the system-defined primary PLMN  towards

the  shared or dedicated Secondary Node with matching

primary PLMNs. In this case, the TermPointToGNB.additionalCnRef MO

attribute is used to differentiate the local SCTP endpoints based on the primary PLMN

ID.

In case of a shared neighbor gNodeB, up to three potential child

TermPointToGNB MOs can be created under the same parent

ExternalGNodeBFunction MO. Each child

TermPointToGNB MO represents the potential EN-DC X2 connections

towards the same remote shared Secondary Node. There is one potential EN-DC X2

connection for each of the following Master Node primary PLMN IDs, which are equal to or

the equivalent of the active PLMN IDs in the remote shared Secondary Node:

- ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId
- EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId
- EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId

#### 3.6.3.2 Required X2-C Connection Setups

Non-required TermPointToENB MO classes and non-required X2-C

connections cause memory waste. To prevent memory waste, only the required X2-C

connections are created in the MORAN on single Baseband configuration. Required X2-C

connections come from a local eNodeB with the MORAN on single Baseband configuration,

and are received by one of the following eNodeBs:

- A neighboring eNodeB with a primary PLMN ID that matches the primary PLMN ID of the local system.
- A neighboring eNodeB with a primary PLMN ID that matches the additional PLMN ID of the local system.
- A neighboring eNodeB with an additional PLMN ID that matches the additional PLMN ID of the local system.

### 3.6.4 EN-DC Configuration

The Shared LTE RAN feature can be used also in NSA deployments with EN-DC. This is

possible for all the shared LTE RAN scenarios, in non-shared, or shared NR RAN.

In case of shared NR RAN, it is possible to have EN-DC with the following

configurations:

- Separate gNodeBs for each operator
- Shared gNodeBs with separate cells for each operator
- Shared gNodeBs with shared cells
- Shared gNodeBs with a mix of shared and separate cells

The cell and gNodeB selection is based on the PLMN.

For more information on EN-DC deployments configured with MORAN on

single Baseband, see Supported X2-C and EN-DC X2-C Configurations for eNodeBs Configured as MORAN on Single Baseband.

For more information on shared NR RAN configurations, see Shared NR RAN in

the NR RAN library.

## 3.7 Privacy Impact

The Shared LTE RAN feature has privacy implications.

When operators share the Baseband Radio Node using a shared

RAN feature, then the personal data of the participating operators' subscribers are

processed by the Baseband Radio Node in plain-text. All other features with a privacy

implication listed in the Manage Security document have an impact on the subscribers of the

participating operators.

For example, if the personal data protection is

disabled, then the permanent subscriber identifiers of the

participating operators might be revealed in PM events.

For more information on related privacy implications, see

Manage Security.

## 3.8 Processes for Selecting Local SCTP Endpoints for MORAN on Single Baseband

In an EN-DC deployment within a MORAN on single Baseband configuration, S1-C and X2-C

configurations are separated. Figure 3 shows the

automated selection process for local SCTP endpoints for X2-C connections. This

automated selection process is different from the selection processes described in Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2.

Figure 3   Automatic Process for Selecting a Local SCTP Endpoint for X2-C

Figure 4 shows the automated selection process

for local SCTP endpoints for EN-DC X2 connections.

# 4 Network Impact of Shared LTE RAN

The key impact of Shared LTE RAN feature is mobility where the UE can be handed over in

networks belonging to different operators.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

In the Shared LTE RAN feature, UE mobility can be extended with appropriate

configuration by the operator, for example the UE can be handed over from network

belonging to one operator to that belonging to another operator.

# 5 Parameters for Shared LTE RAN

The Shared LTE RAN feature introduces new MOM parameters for configuration and affects

already existing MOs representing PLMN lists.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

## 9.1 Prepare the eNodeB for MORAN on Single Baseband Configuration

To allow MORAN on single Baseband configuration, the feature must be configured

according to this procedure.

Steps

1. Set the ENodeBFunction.dnsLookupOnTai attribute to OFF.
2. Set the ENodeBFunction.ipsecEpAddressRef attribute to empty.
3. Set the ENodeBFunction.ipsecEndcEpAddressRef attribute to empty.
4. Set the AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute to DEACTIVATED.
5. Set the EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute to NOT\_ALLOWED for all cell relations on both the local and external eNodeB.
6. Activate and configure the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature. The following configuration for the MORAN on single Baseband configuration is required: The AdditionalCoreNetwork.plmnList attribute must match the configured EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attributes. The AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpS1Ref attribute must be configured and must be different from the ENodeBFunction.sctpRef attribute. For X2-C connections, the local SCTP endpoints are separated by the local eNodeB.(1) For EN-DC X2-C connections, the local SCTP endpoints are separated by the Master Node.(2) The AdditionalCoreNetwork.ipsecEpAddressRef and AdditionalCoreNetwork.ipsecEndcEpAddressRef attributes must be empty. Other Shared LTE RAN functions are not prerequisites of the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature.
7. Put the global eNodeB IDs of the local eNodeB that is to be configured with the MORAN on Single Baseband configuration of the Shared LTE RAN feature on the denylist in the neighboring dedicated eNodeBs using the ENodeBFunction.x2BlackList attribute. This is to prevent non-required X2 setup requests from neighboring eNodeBs. For more information about non-required X2 setup requests, see Required X2-C Connection Setups.
8. Optional: Lock the MOCN as MORAN cells that serve secondary operators where the EUtranCellFDD.primaryPlmnReserved or the EUtranCellTDD.primaryPlmnReserved attribute is set to true. This step is required only if a MOCN as MORAN LTE cell is to be replaced with a MORAN LTE cell.
9. Optional: Delete the MOCN as MORAN cells that serve secondary operators where the EUtranCellFDD.primaryPlmnReserved or the EUtranCellTDD.primaryPlmnReserved is set to true. This step is required only if a MOCN as MORAN LTE cell is to be replaced with a MORAN LTE cell.
10. Optional: Remove the PLMN ID of the secondary operator from the EUtranCellFDD.additionalPlmnList or the EUtranCellTDD.additionalPlmnList attribute. Shared cells must have all PLMNs defined under the same MME pool and under the same local endpoint.
11. Optional: Create a TermPointToMme MO class that belongs to the secondary operator with reference to the AdditionalCoreNetwork MO class. This step is required only if a TermPointToMme MO class that belongs to the secondary operator and has a reference to the AdditionalCoreNetwork MO class is not already in use.

Endpoints for MORAN on Single Baseband in Shared LTE RAN.

## 9.2 Configure MORAN on Single Baseband

To activate the MORAN

on

single Baseband configuration, a cell-level primary PLMN has to be

configured.

Prerequisites

- The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature is activated.
- Features that conflict with the MORAN on single Baseband configuration are deactivated.
- The eNodeB is configured according to the instructions in section Prepare the eNodeB for MORAN on Single Baseband Configuration in Shared LTE RAN.

Steps

1. Set the ENodeBFunction.moranOnSingleBbEnabled attribute to true.
2. Restart the node.
3. Create a secondary operator MORAN cell with the defined EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or the EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attributes. The configured value must match the value of the AdditionalCoreNetwork.plmnList attribute. Result: The MORAN cell is locked.
4. Set the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute to NOT\_ALLOWED on the local and external eNodeBs.
5. Optional: Unlock the locked TermPointToMme MOs that refer to the additional core network, that is, the second operator. This step is required only if a TermPointToMME MO class belonging to the secondary operator is created in Prepare the eNodeB for MORAN on Single Baseband Configuration.
6. Unlock the MORAN cell that serves the secondary operator. For information on how ESS-related features work together with the Shared LTE RAN feature, see Ericsson Spectrum Sharing.

## 9.3 Configure X2-C Connections for MORAN on Single Baseband

If MORAN on single Baseband is configured on the source eNodeB in the Shared LTE RAN

feature, a TermPointToENB MO instance can be created for each primary

PLMN.

Figure 5   X2-C Connections for MORAN on Single Baseband

Prerequisites

- The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature is activated.
- The Shared LTE RAN feature is activated.
- The source eNodeB is configured as MORAN on single Baseband.

Steps

Perform the following steps to configure X2-C connections towards a dedicated

eNodeB or an eNodeB configured as MORAN on single Baseband:

1. Create a TermPointToENB MO instance under the ExternalENodeBFunction MO to represent the eNodeB that broadcasts PLMN0. Ensure that the TermPointToENB.additionalCnRef attribute is set to the default value.
2. Create a TermPointToENB MO instance under the ExternalENodeBFunction MO representing the eNodeB that broadcasts PLMN1. To avoid MO naming collision, the TermPointToENB MO instance has to follow the following naming convention if the Shared LTE RAN feature with cell-defined primary PLMN ID is activated: TermPointToENB\_&lt;PLMN-ENBID&gt; TermPointToENB\_&lt;PLMN-ENBID&gt;-&lt;1st cellprimaryPlmnId&gt; TermPointToENB\_&lt;PLMN-ENBID&gt;-&lt;2nd cellprimaryPlmnId&gt; The &lt;PLMN-ENBID&gt; variable has to match the attributes defined on the node level, with the &lt;PLMN&gt; variable matching the ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId attribute and the &lt;&lt;&gt; variable matching the ENodeBFunction.eNBId attribute. In case of MO naming collision, the creation of new TermPointToENB MO instances is rejected. Ensure that the TermPointToENB.additionalCnRef attribute references the AdditionalCoreNetwork MO that has an AdditionalCoreNetwork.plmnList attribute matching the EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or the EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attributes of the cell configured with cell-defined primary PLMN ID.
3. Unlock the TermPointToENB MO instance.

Perform the following steps to configure X2-C connections towards a shared

eNodeB:

4. Create a TermPointToENB MO instance for PLMN0 under the ExternalEnodeBFunction MO. Ensure that the TermPointToENB.additionalCnRef attribute is set to the default value.
5. Create a TermPointToENB MO instance for PLMN1 under the ExternalEnodeBFunction MO. To avoid MO naming collision, the TermPointToENB MO instance has to follow the naming conventions described in Step 2. Ensure that the TermPointToENB.additionalCnRef attribute references the AdditionalCoreNetwork MO that has an AdditionalCoreNetwork.plmnList attribute matching the EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or the EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attributes of the cell configured with cell-defined primary PLMN ID.
6. Unlock the TermPointToENB MO instance.

Supported X2-C and EN-DC X2-C Configurations for eNodeBs Configured as MORAN on Single Baseband

## 9.4 Configure EN-DC X2 Connections for MORAN on Single Baseband

The EN-DC setup must be manually preconfigured to operate between the Master Node and

the Secondary Node.

The MORAN on single Baseband configuration sets up the EN-DC X2 connection for each

Master Node based on the primary PLMN defined in the system.

The TermPointToGNB.additionalCnRef MO attribute refers to the

AdditionalCoreNetwork MO instance that contains the source

EN-DC X2AP SCTP endpoint for additional MORAN Master Nodes.

Prerequisites

- The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature is activated.
- The Shared LTE RAN feature is activated.
- The value of at least one EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute is not empty.
- The AnrFunctionNR.anrStateNR attribute set to DEACTIVATED.

Steps

1. Create the TermPointToGNB MO.
2. Set the referenced AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpEndcX2Ref attribute so that its value is different from the ENodeBFunction.sctpEndcX2Ref and other configured AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpEndcX2Ref attributes, as described in Processes for Selecting Local SCTP Endpoints for MORAN on Single Baseband. If the value of the AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpEndcX2Ref attribute is empty, the value of the AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpX2Ref or the AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpS1Ref attribute is used.
3. Unlock the TermPointToGNB MO.

| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 0860        |
| Value Package Name:     | Shared Networks     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0434        |

The MORAN on single Baseband configuration allows the configuration of three sets of

cells, each with its own primary PLMN ID. One set of cells uses the node-level primary

PLMN ID. For this set, additional PLMN IDs can be defined on the cell level. The other

two sets of cells use a cell-defined primary PLMN ID each. For these cells, no

additional PLMN IDs can be defined. The same cell-defined primary PLMN ID cannot be used

in two different sets of cells.

Benefits

The enhancement offers the following main benefits:

- In addition to the node-level primary PLMN ID, the operator can define up to two cell-level primary PLMNs on the same eNodeB. This increases the flexibility of the Shared LTE RAN configuration.
- The MORAN on single Baseband configuration can replace the MOCN as MORAN configuration, which has issues during UE idle mode and connected mode mobility because of reserved primary PLMN IDs.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following attributes are introduced:

- EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId
- EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId
- TermPointToENB.additionalCnRef

The enhancement is active if the following conditions are met:

- The Shared LTE RAN feature is activated.
- The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature is activated.
- At least one cell exists with a configured EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute.

The primary PLMN ID is included in the Global eNodeB ID, as defined in 3GPP TS

36.300. This means that each cell that is configured with a cell-defined

primary PLMN ID appears to belong to an additional eNodeB. The enhancement provides

support for S1-C connectivity to the core network and X2-C connectivity to neighbor

eNodeBs for the additional Global eNodeB IDs.

When the enhancement is active, the cardinality of TermPointToENB

MOs is increased from one to three. This means that up to three potential child

TermPointToENB MOs are allowed under the same parent

ExternalENodeBFunction MO. The three child

TermPointToENB MOs are representations of potential X2-C

connections towards the same remote shared eNodeB. There is one potential X2-C

connection for each local eNodeB primary PLMN ID

(ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId or

EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or

EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId) matching the active

PLMN IDs in the remote shared eNodeB.

The following PM counters are modified:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbTransPlmn0
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbTransPlmn0
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolUlDrbPlmn0
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolUlDrbPlmn0

The following PM event parameters are modified:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_GENBID
- EVENT\_PARAM\_SEND\_GENBID
- EVENT\_PARAM\_RECV\_GENBID

The enhancement affects alarm handling in the following way:

- The PLMN Service Degraded alarm is extended to include EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId and EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId in the list of PLMNs that cannot be served in the cell.
- The PLMN Service Unavailable alarm is extended to include EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId and EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId in the list of PLMNs that cannot be served in the cell.
- The Configuration Requires Feature Activation alarm is raised if the following conditions are met: The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature or the Shared LTE RAN feature, or both are deactivated. The EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or the EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute is configured.
- The MO Configuration Requires Key Install and Feature Activation alarm is raised if the following conditions are met: The license is not installed for the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature or the Shared LTE RAN feature, or both. The EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or the EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute is configured.
- The Service Unavailable alarm is raised if the following conditions are met: The license is not installed for the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature or the Shared LTE RAN feature, or both. The Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 and the Shared LTE RAN features are activated. The EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId or the EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId attribute is configured.

## Appendix A.j: 22.Q2: EN-DC Master Node Support for MORAN on Single Baseband Configuration with Dedicated Secondary Node

The feature enhancement removes the limitation of the MORAN on single Baseband

configuration that prevents using EN-DC connectivity with LTE MORAN cells as anchor

cells.

| Feature Name           | Shared LTE RAN      |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 0860        |

| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows MORAN LTE cells configured in a MORAN on single

Baseband configuration to be used as anchor cells in an EN-DC deployment.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- It avoids broadcasting reserved PLMNs on the EN-DC anchor cell within a MORAN on single Baseband configuration.
- It simplifies network planning by replacing the MOCN as MORAN configuration with the MORAN on single Baseband configuration.
- EN-DC-capable UEs connected to an LTE MORAN anchor cell can establish an EN-DC setup with basic EN-DC functions.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement supports EN-DC connectivity for Master Nodes with MORAN on

single Baseband configuration with a dedicated Secondary Node. The Secondary Node is

dedicated for each operator, and is on a separate Baseband unit. The EN-DC X2

connection is established with the following limitations:

- Dedicated Secondary Nodes are not supported in a Mixed Mode Baseband LTE + NR deployment
- Mobility is not supported from Master Nodes with MORAN on single Baseband configuration towards shared Secondary Nodes (NR MOCN and NR MORAN cells)

The MORAN on single Baseband configuration sets up the EN-DC X2 connection for each

Master Node. Master Nodes are differentiated based on the following primary PLMNs

defined in the system:

- ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId
- EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId
- EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId

Only a manually pre-configured EN-DC setup is supported between the Master Node and

the Secondary Node.

Master Nodes are logged through the following updated PM event parameters related to

EN-DC X2 procedures:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_SEND\_GLOBAL\_RN\_ID
- EVENT\_PARAM\_RECV\_GLOBAL\_RN\_ID

Information about the connected Secondary Nodes is sent to the MMEs over the

operational S1AP session.

The TermPointToGNB.additionalCnRef MO attribute is introduced.

This MO attribute refers to the AdditionalCoreNetwork MO instance

that contains the source EN-DC X2AP SCTP endpoint for additional MORAN Master Nodes.

If this MO attribute is empty, the configuration from the

ENodeBFunction MO class is used.

The following MO attributes are updated:

- EUtranCellFDD.primaryUpperLayerInd
- EUtranCellTDD.primaryUpperLayerInd
- EUtranCellFDD.upperLayerAutoConfIndList
- EUtranCellTDD.upperLayerAutoConfIndList
- AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpX2Ref
- AdditionalCoreNetwork.sctpEndcX2Ref

Interfaces

deploy one or two Baseband units when the eNodeB is configured with the MORAN on single Baseband configuration.

This feature enhancement has the following limitations:

- EN-DC X2 connectivity to shared Secondary Nodes is not supported.
- LTE MORAN cells with the ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId defined in the system are not supported for ESS configuration if they are paired with a shared gNodeB.
- Shared gNodeBs are not supported for ESS configuration on sites that deploy one Baseband unit.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

If an eNodeB is configured with the MORAN on single Baseband

configuration, an EN-DC X2 connection can be set up for each Master Node. Master

Nodes are differentiated based on the following primary PLMN attributes defined in

the system:

- ENodeBFunction.eNodeBPlmnId
- EUtranCellFDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId
- EUtranCellTDD.cellDefinedPrimaryPlmnId

On sites that deploy two separate Baseband units, the following ESS configurations

are supported with eNodeBs that are configured with the MORAN on single Baseband configuration:

- A Master Node with MORAN on single Baseband configuration that provides LTE anchor on non-MORAN cells
- A Master Node with MORAN on single Baseband configuration that provides LTE anchor on MORAN cells

Both Master Nodes are paired with Mixed Mode LTE + NR that is on a separate Baseband

unit. The following ESS cell pairs are supported on Mixed Mode LTE + NR:

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides ESS support for the LTE + NR Mixed Mode Baseband

setup, where the eNodeB unit is configured with the MORAN on single Baseband, and

the gNodeB is configured with Shared NR RAN configurations. The eNodeB unit provides

MORAN and non-MORAN ESS-configured LTE cells. The gNodeB unit provides NR cells with

MOCN NR, MORAN NR, or MOCN as MORAN NR configuration as ESS-configured NR cells.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Coverage is extended for ESS service providers with the inclusion of shared Secondary Nodes in the supported setups.
- Equipment usability is increased for the primary operator, and operational expenses are decreased for the secondary operator with the inclusion of shared Secondary Nodes in a Mixed Mode Baseband configuration.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement reuses configuration introduced in the L22.Q4: EN-DC Master

Node Support for MORAN on Single Baseband Configuration with Shared Secondary Node

enhancement.

This feature enhancement is enabled if the following settings are fulfilled:

- The Shared LTE RAN feature is enabled.
- The prerequisite Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature is active.
- The ENodeBFunction.moranOnSingleBbEnabled attribute is set to TRUE.

The operator has to follow the usual ESS configuration on the ESS cell pairs to

provide ESS support.

This enhancement provides ESS support for both single and dual Baseband ESS

deployments.

In the single Baseband ESS deployment, the LTE + NR Mixed Mode Baseband configuration

is on the same Baseband unit, which provides ESS cell pairs with the following

configurations:

- The secondary gNodeB has one of the following configurations: Shared NR RAN MOCN Shared NR RAN MOCN as MORAN Shared NR RAN MORAN
- The eNodeB uses the MORAN on single Baseband with the following simultaneous configurations: The non-MORAN and the MORAN LTE cells are enabled for the ESS cell pair. The eNodeB provides LTE anchor carrier for NR cells in the ESS cell pair.

In the dual Baseband ESS deployment, the eNodeB provides LTE anchor carrier for NR

cells in the ESS cell pairs. The LTE + NR Mixed Mode Baseband configuration is on a

separate Baseband unit, which provides ESS cell pairs with the following

configurations:

- The secondary gNodeB has one of the following configurations: Shared NR RAN MOCN Shared NR RAN MOCN as MORAN Shared NR RAN MORAN
- The eNodeB uses the MORAN on single Baseband configuration, where the non-MORAN and the MORAN LTE cells are enabled for the ESS cell pair.
