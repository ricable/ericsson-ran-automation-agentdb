# 1 Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection Overview

The Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection feature extends the CS Fallback feature to

GERAN and UTRAN.

Summary

The feature enables the eNodeB to redirect the UE to the highest prioritized frequency, based

on measurements when a Circuit Switched fallback is required.

This feature also allows the operator to define alternative target frequencies if the

measurement times out, or a Packet Switched handover preparation fails.

The feature ensures that there is a valid target frequency to perform a Release with

Redirection when UE Circuit Switched fallback requests are handled.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Making the CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature more robust.
- Improving the PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN feature performance.

# 3 Feature Operation of Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection

The Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection feature extends the Circuit Switched

Fallback feature to GERAN and UTRAN by enabling the eNodeB to redirect the UE to the highest

prioritized frequency.

When an eNodeB initiates an RwR to a frequency, where the voice call can be handled,

based on the CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature, the

Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection feature enables a robust RwR. This is done by

using two lists to determine the target frequency. The List 1 is a CSFB priority list,

which gives the top priority frequencies for measurement. The List 2 is an alternative

CSFB target list which is used when a configurable measurement time-out expires.

To enhance the chance of finding a valid target, List 1 and List 2 must have different or

even reversed priority settings. In Table 2, f1

and f2 are excluded from the List 2, since they cannot be selected as alternative

targets.

Table 2   Example of List 1 and List 2 Configuration

| RAT/Frequency   | csFallbackPrio (List 1)   | altCsfbTarg (List 2)   |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| WCDMA/f1        | 7 (highest)               | –1 (excluded)          |
| WCDMA/f2        | 7 (highest)               | –1 (excluded)          |
| WCDMA/f3        | 6                         | 5                      |
| WCDMA/f4        | 6                         | 5                      |
| WCDMA/f5        | 5                         | 3                      |
| WCDMA/f6        | 5                         | 3                      |
| GSM/f7          | 4                         | 7 (highest)            |
| GSM/f8          | 4                         | 7 (highest)            |
| GSM/f9          | 3                         | 6                      |

The Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection feature can also improve the PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN feature performance. This is

done by using the List 2 to find a target frequency for RwR when a handover preparation

fails.

When WCDMA and GSM have same CSFB priority, the measurement objects in measurement

configuration to UE are ordered by round-robin scheduling. It is recommended to

configure the GERAN frequency group with a different priority depending on the sum of

GERAN frequencies with same CSFB priority. If it is greater than the maximum number of

GERAN frequencies supported by UE. According to 3GPP 36.133 UE is allowed to measure on

GSM layer with up to 32 frequencies.

Operational Process, when Only F1 is Activated

Figure 1   Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection Operation with Only F1

1. The MME sends an S1-AP message with a Circuit Switched fallback indicator to the eNodeB. The S1-AP message can be one of the following: A UE context modification request, in RRC Connected mode A UE context initialization request, in RRC Idle mode, when attribute ENodeBFunction.csfbMeasFromIdleMode is set to TRUE
2. The eNodeB does not initiate UE measurements, if any of the following conditions are met: The UE does not support target frequencies in List 1. GeranFreqGroupRelation.csFallbackPrio is set to -1 for supported frequencies. As a result CSFB fails and the UE is released abnormally without any target RAT release information.
3. The eNodeB initiates UE measurements, if any of the following conditions are met: The UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute is set to TRUE. The UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN or UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN attribute is set to TRUE when the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated. Otherwise, the eNodeB selects the RwR target without measurement, as the CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature defines.
4. The eNodeB triggers the B1 measurement or B2, depending on UE capabilities and measurements, starting from the highest prioritized frequency in List 1. B1 measurement is used if the UE supports both B1 measurement and B2 measurement. After a measurement report is received, the Location Area Identification (LAI) reported by the UE is checked with registered LAI before proceeding with RwR. If the reported LAI is other than registered LAI, the eNodeB ignores the report. When a UE measurement report is received, the eNodeB selects the first frequency, or frequency group in case of GERAN, in the report as the target to do RwR.
5. If no target frequency is found until the UeMeasControl.csfbHoTargetSearchTimer times out, the eNodeB releases the UE to a frequency that is selected from List 2. This is based on the following: UE capabilities Alternative Circuit Switched fallback target frequency priorities defined with the GeranFreqGroupRelation.altCsfbTargetPrio attribute for each available frequency relation For UEs associated with a SPID, the priorities defined with the altCsfbTargetPrio attribute of the corresponding frequency overrides that defined in the frequency relations. Note: The UeMeasControl.csfbHoTargetSearchTimer attribute configured on the eNodeB side must have a lower value than the S1TUeContextReleaseCSFBToWG attribute on the MME side. At UE release, NACC information is included in the RRC connection release message, which can shorten call setup time in target RAT. This requires that NACC information is available for the target frequency, and one of the following conditions is met: UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT\_NACC. UtranFreqRelation.mobilityActionfCsfb attribute is set to HANDOVER.

Operation Process When Both Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection and

PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN Features are Activated

Figure 2   Feature Operation with Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection and PSHO-Based

CS Fallback to UTRAN

When both Measurement-Based CSFB Target Selection and PSHO-Based CS Fallback to UTRAN

features are activated, the features operate the same as if only PSHO-Based CS

Fallback to UTRAN is activated, except during the following cases:

- If the List 1 UeMeasControl.csfbHoTargetSearchTimer times out
- If the handover preparation fails, whether it is a blind handover or not

In both cases, the eNodeB redirects the UE to an alternative frequency selected from

the List 2.

The improvement gives the possibility to skip RRC messages before UE release when CS fallback

is started from RRC Idle mode, if no CS fallback measurements are

needed. It also enables that NACC information is included in the RRC connection release

message when the CS fallback measurement times out or when a CSFB-triggered handover

preparation fails. This can shorten call setup time in target RAT.

Capacity and Performance

With the improvement, CS fallback setup time can be shortened.
