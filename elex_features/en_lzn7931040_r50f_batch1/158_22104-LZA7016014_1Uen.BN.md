# 3 Feature Operation of FDD and TDD on Same eNodeB

The FDD and TDD on Same eNodeB feature can be configured with both FDD and TDD

cells.

If the OptionalFeatureLicense.serviceState attribute has the

INOPERABLE value, the following applies:

- Before the feature is activated, only one of two cell types, FDD or TDD, can be enabled on the eNodeB.
- Cells of either type can be created, locked, unlocked, or deleted, regardless of the OptionalFeatureLicense.serviceState status, and regardless of the type of cells which already exists on the eNodeB.
- If there are no unlocked cells on the eNodeB, only cells of one type are successfully enabled when unlocked. An alarm is raised against the other cell type, indicating Configuration Requires Feature Activation, see Table 2.
- If only one cell type is unlocked and enabled, only cells of the same type can be successfully unlocked and enabled. Unlocked cells of the other type are disabled and an alarm indicating Configuration Requires Feature Activation is raised, see Table 2.
- The cell type enabled after an eNodeB restart can be different from the type enabled before the restart. This applies when both FDD and TDD cells are in an unlocked state before the restart.

If the OptionalFeatureLicense.serviceState attribute has the

OPERABLE value, the following applies:

- Cells of either type can be unlocked and enabled in any order.
- Any cell that is in a disabled state before the attribute becomes OPERABLE, remains disabled. To enable this cell, a cell lock and unlock sequence is necessary.

If the OptionalFeatureLicense.serviceState attribute value changes from

OPERABLE to INOPERABLE, cells that are enabled and provide

service continue to provide service regardless of the attribute status. However, if both FDD

and TDD cells are enabled, cells that are locked cannot return to an enabled state unless the

attribute is OPERABLE.

The following table identifies conditions under which alarms are raised related to license

and feature activation.

# 7 Activate FDD and TDD on Same eNodeB

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Clock Source over GPS feature is activated.
- The ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment attribute is set to true.
- At least one of the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationTdd and ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationTdd(1-7) attributes is set to 1.5 µs. One parameter can be set separately for each TDD cell, regardless of the maximum number of TDD cells. The parameter that is set to the value 1.5 µs must be chosen using the EUtranCellTDD.timePhaseMaxDeviationTddIndex attribute. When EUtranCellTDD.timePhaseMaxDeviationTddIndex is configured with 0, it refers to the attribute ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationTdd. When EUtranCellTDD.timePhaseMaxDeviationTddIndex is configured with 1-7, it refers to timePhaseMaxDeviationTdd(1-7) respectively. Note: When the time and phase synchronization deviation exceeds the limit defined in the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationTdd or the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationTdd(1-7) attribute, the affected TDD cells are disabled, and the Service Unavailable secondary alarm is raised for these cells.
- Each member of the EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset attribute is set to 0.
- TDD cells have consistent frame start offset configuration. Table 4 Supported EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset Configuration Hardware subframeAssignment frameStartOffset Baseband product Any The difference between values of EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset for different cells on one Baseband unit cannot be more than 210 µs.(1) (1) The same maximum frame start offset difference is supported between attributes EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset and EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset. To have both FDD and TDD E-UTRAN cells on one node, the FDD and TDD on Same eNodeB feature is required.

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011930 MO instance.

After This Task
