# 1 Dynamic PUCCH Overview

The feature dynamically allocates and deallocates PUCCH resources depending on the

signaling load.

Summary

The Dynamic PUCCH feature dynamically allocates and deallocates PUCCH PRB pairs so

that more PRB resources are available for PUSCH, compared to the static PUCCH

dimensioning. The feature can also provide a SON type of operation which

automatically reconfigures PUCCH based on the cell load.

The feature has the following benefits::

- Higher UE peak throughput in a low-loaded cell (with only one or a few UEs) because more PUSCH PRBs are available for scheduling.
- Ease of use, because dimensioning and configuration of PUCCH resources are not needed.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature operates only on FDD.

Network Requirements

No Network Requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dynamic PUCCH

The Dynamic PUCCH feature dynamically allocates and deallocates PUCCH PRB pairs so that more

PRB resources are available for PUSCH compared to the static PUCCH dimensioning. The feature

can also provide a SON type of operation which automatically reconfigures PUCCH based on the

cell load.

Category M UEs in connected mode cannot monitor System Information

(SI) changes initiated by the Dynamic PUCCH feature. This results in degraded KPIs for the

Category M Access feature only if a SI change happens.

When both the Dynamic PUCCH and Category M Access features are enabled, SI change is only

triggered if the PUCCH PRB increases beyond the PRACH frequency position limitation. Then, the

PRACH frequency offset is updated in SIB2. In contrast, PUCCH PRB decrease does not trigger SI

update, which means the PRACH frequency position is unchanged.

# 4 Network Impact of Dynamic PUCCH

The implementation of this feature has impact on the UE throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Higher UE peak throughput in a low-loaded cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Dynamic PUCCH

The feature introduces new MOM parameters for configuration and uses already existing

parameters to allocate and deallocate PUCCH PRB pairs to increase PRB resource

availability.
