# 3 Feature Operation of Dual Layer Beamforming Performance Package

Data transmission over two spatial layers are realized through Transmission Mode

8.

The Dual Layer Beamforming Performance Package introduces 3GPP Transmission Mode 8.

Transmission Mode 8 is a mode which allows transmission of data over two spatial layers.

The Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) and Rank Indicator (RI) feedback from the UE is

used for calculating the beamforming weights to separate the streams at the receiver.

The dual streams of data are transmitted using beamforming antenna ports 7 and 8, with

each antenna port connected to eight physical antennas with individual weighting on each

physical antenna.

For more information about port mapping, see:

- Configuration for 8TX/8RX Radios in Combination with 8-Port Antenna Units in Manage Hardware Equipment

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Dual Layer Beamforming Performance Package

This chapter introduces the configuration of the four MOM parameters, to customize

beamforming.

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

The cell is initially setup with a cell covering beam pattern

for the common channels to all UEs. The cell covering beam pattern is also used for 3GPP

transmission mode 3 (TM3). Common channel beamforming introduces the following MOM

parameters to select the initial beamforming weights for all downlink channels:

- AntennaSubunit.azimuthHalfPowerBeamwidth
- AntennaSubunit.commonChBeamfrmPortMap
- AntennaSubunit.customComChBeamfrmWtsAmplitude
- AntennaSubunit.customComChBeamfrmWtsPhase

The AntennaSubunit.azimuthHalfPowerBeamwidth  and the

AntennaSubunit.commonChBeamfrmPortMap parameters allow the user

to configure cross-polarized antennas with 65 and 90 degree half-power beamwidth, and

co-polarized antennas with 65 and 90 degree half-power beamwidth.

Radio calibration capability is required in the uplink and downlink. Calibration of

radios and antennas is required to enable beamforming. The relative phase of the antenna

paths are calibrated in both uplink and downlink so that the channel information from

the uplink can be used to control downlink beamforming.

At high interference, the uplink antenna calibration becomes more accurate with the noise

reduction capability. This way, the TM8 downlink UE throughput degradation can be

mitigated because the reciprocity-based downlink beamforming accuracy is ensured.

UE capability information is retrieved from the UE before switching the transmission to

TM8, if the Single Layer Beamforming Performance Package is activated TM7 is used,

otherwise TM3 is used until the UE capability is known.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q3: Improved Downlink Beamforming Accuracy

More stable and more accurate DL beamforming directionality for 8TX TM8 PDSCH transmission by this improvement.

| Feature Name:           | Dual Layer Beamforming Performance Package   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3000 R2                              |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R8                              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node           |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                          |

Increased median filtering is applied to the tracking of the direction of the UE by the eNB.

This gives more stable and more accurate DL beamforming directionality for 8TX TM8 PDSCH

transmission which translates to increased DL throughput. Aside from the improvement in

8TX TM8 beamforming directionality, it is also a prerequisite to realize DL throughput

gain for the TM8 Mode Switching feature.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

DL throughput gains between 0 - 10% are possible. This does not apply for all SINR ranges, but

for particular ranges the potential gain is around 10%, while the average gain is

less than that. UEs subjected to RF channel conditions with high angular spread will

tend to see more performance benefit with this change whereas UEs with good line of

sight channel conditions will tend to see less performance benefit. Hence, the

performance benefit will vary depending on RF propagation in the cell for a given

UE.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
