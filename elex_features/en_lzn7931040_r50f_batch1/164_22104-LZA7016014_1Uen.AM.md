# 1 Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB Overview

The feature introduces limited uplink awareness to load balancing and adapts the

aggregated subscription capacity calculation.

In mobile networks, a cell can have insufficient uplink capacity to sustain the full

throughput on the downlink. If the load balancing mechanism moves a UE to a limited

uplink cell, uplink congestion can occur. This can cause UE rejection or cell

overload.

The Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB feature enhances the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature

by adding limited uplink awareness to the load-balancing mechanism to prevent it from

moving UEs to a limited uplink cell. The feature also enhances the Carrier

Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature by adapting the calculation of aggregated subscription

capacity.

The Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB feature enhances Inter-Frequency Load Balancing, so that             the calculation of cell subscription capacity considers the uplink capacity of the cell.             This helps to prevent the limited-uplink cell from uplink congestion during load             balancing. |

The enhancement helps to avoid moving UEs to a             cell with uplink congestion.                                     |

# 3 Feature Operation of Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB

The feature improves load balancing by considering potential limitation in uplink

capacity during the cell subscription capacity calculation. The feature also adapts the

aggregated subscription capacity calculation.

Enhancement of the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing Feature

In the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, an important factor for making load

balancing decisions is cell subscription capacity. Cell subscription capacity represents the

traffic bearing capacity of a cell.

Cell subscription capacity is calculated using cell downlink capacity. Cell downlink

capacity is estimated by the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature automatically and

periodically. The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature takes the estimation result as the

value of cell subscription capacity for the cell.

sCap = estCap

| sCap   |    | Cell subscription capacity       |
|--------|----|----------------------------------|
|        |    |                                  |
| estCap |    | Estimated cell downlink capacity |

The Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB feature enhances the cell subscription capacity calculation

by considering the uplink capacity of the cell. To calculate the cell subscription capacity,

the cell downlink capacity is multiplied with a scaling factor, which reduces the calculated

cell subscription capacity of the limited-uplink cells. The scaling factor is configured

manually.

sCap = estCap × sFactor

| sCap    |    | Cell subscription capacity       |
|---------|----|----------------------------------|
|         |    |                                  |
| estCap  |    | Estimated cell downlink capacity |
|         |    |                                  |
| sFactor |    | Scaling factor                   |

The enhanced cell subscription capacity calculation reduces the probability of moving UEs

to the limited-uplink cells.

Adaptation of the Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB Feature

The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature improves the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

feature by considering CA-capable UEs.

The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB calculates the aggregated subscription capacity using

the subscription capacity of the PCell and the subscription capacity of each SCell.

caCap = sCapPCell + ΣSCell sCapSCell

| caCap     |    | Aggregated subscription capacity   |
|-----------|----|------------------------------------|
|           |    |                                    |
| sCapPCell |    | Subscription capacity of the PCell |
|           |    |                                    |
| sCapSCell |    | Subscription capacity of the SCell |

The Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB feature adapts the PCell subscription capacity calculation

to consider uplink limitation. However, the subscription capacity of the SCells is

calculated based on their downlink capacity. Therefore, the feature adapts the aggregated

subscription capacity calculation by introducing the cell downlink CA capacity, which only

considers downlink capacity and corresponds to the legacy cell subscription capacity.

caCap = sCapPCell + ΣSCell dlCaCapSCell

| caCap     |    | Aggregated subscription capacity   |
|-----------|----|------------------------------------|
|           |    |                                    |
| sCapPCell |    | Subscription capacity of the PCell |
|           |    |                                    |
| sCapSCell |    | Subscription capacity of the SCell |
|           |    |                                    |
| dlCaCap   |    | Cell downlink CA capacity          |

The adaptation preserves the intended calculation of the aggregated subscription

capacity.

# 7 Activate Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011966 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB

The Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB feature requires manual configuration to enhance the

Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature, and adapt the Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB

feature.

The Limited-Uplink-Aware IFLB feature depends on the Inter-frequency Load Balancing feature,

and it is used together with the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature and Carrier

Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature.

Configuration of Cell Subscription Capacity

Besides activating the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature, the operator needs to

configure the following attributes manually under the cell:

- EUtranCellFDD.estCellCapUsableFraction
- EUtranCellTDD.estCellCapUsableFraction

If the attributes are set to 0, the cell takes the value of the following

attributes as the value of cell subscription capacity:

- EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity

This bypasses automated cell capacity estimation for the cell.

Configuration of Cell Downlink CA Capacity

If the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature is not activated, the operator needs to

configure the following attributes manually:

- EUtranCellFDD.cellDownlinkCaCapacity
- EUtranCellTDD.cellDownlinkCaCapacity

If the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature is activated, no configuration is needed.

The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB takes the result of Automated Cell Capacity Estimation as

the value of the cellDownlinkCaCapacity attribute.
