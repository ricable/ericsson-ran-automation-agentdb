Summary

This feature has the benefit of increasing UE performance through performing a

handover from overloaded LTE cells.

If an LTE cell is

overused,

the Inter-RAT Offload to

WCDMA

feature performs a handover of traffic load to a configured set

of WCDMA FDD cells with extra capacity. This feature allows for the cooperation of

LTE and WCDMA cells to optimize traffic load without the control of a central

node

The Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA feature is an add-on to the Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing feature, and uses this feature to assess traffic load. These features can

be used independently or simultaneously. Simultaneous use of these features has the

benefit of allowing for inter-frequency load balancing and inter-RAT offload

This feature has the following benefits:

- It reduces the risk that the UE performs poorly because of it being trapped in an overused LTE cell.

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

The feature manages traffic load between neighboring cells.

The Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA feature is

part of the Load Management features in LTE RAN. Load balancing relations are configured

between the E-UTRAN cell and UTRAN cells. The Inter-RAT Offload feature is used to offload

traffic to the UTRAN network if the traffic load in the E-UTRAN cells exceeds a configured

level.

## 3.1 Assessment of Traffic Load

The number of UEs to be accommodated in a cell is the decision of the operator, where the

expected service use and the grade of QoS provided to the individual user, as well as the

properties and performance of the cell, are determined by parameters. Increasing the number of

UEs in a cell is a trade-off that allows the operator to serve more users, at the expense of

degrading the overall QoS.

The assessment of traffic load is central for the Inter-RAT offload to WCDMA feature and key

to proper feature behavior. The assessment results in a subscription ratio of each cell. The

Inter-RAT Offload feature uses the same traffic load assessments as used for Inter-frequency

load balancing. The two features also share the same basic algorithm to offload traffic to

neighboring cells.

### 3.1.1 Subscription Ratio

See section Subscription Ratio in Inter-frequency Load Balancing.

### 3.1.2 Load Assessment

The assessment of traffic load in a cell is performed repeatedly

at regular intervals.

The current subscription ratio of the cell is calculated by the

qciSubscriptionQuanta attribute of all E-RABs present in the cell. This

is divided by the EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute in the MO class value of

the cell.

### 3.1.3 Load Balancing Action

Based on the EUtranCellFDD.lbUtranOffloadThreshold or

EUtranCellTDD.lbUtranOffloadThreshold configurable UTRAN offload

threshold attribute , each source cell determines the amount of traffic load to be handed over

to each target UTRAN cell to balance the load differences.

The calculation is done based on the following:

- Load difference between source cell and the UTRAN offload threshold
- Minimum load difference LoadBalancingFunction.lbThreshold to trigger load balancing action
- Total offloading from the source cell. If multiple target cells exist, the total offloading is divided between them
- Maximum load difference LoadBalancingFunction.lbCeiling taken into account in one round of load-balancing action
- FDD only: If the E-RAB configuration of the UE requires handover with SRVCC, it is used in the load balancing action. Handover with SRVCC is described in SRVCC Handover to UTRAN
- The handover cause value is set according to the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1SourceTriggersOffload attribute in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.413; E UTRAN S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)
- If the target UTRAN cell rejects the load balancing action handover, the source cell temporarily removes the UTRAN cell from the set of offload target cells. The UTRAN cell is restored in the set of offload target cells after a configurable backoff time LoadBalancingFunction.lbUtranOffloadBackoffTime

The execution of load balancing actions is performed by handover of selected UEs to the

target UTRAN cells. In the UE selection process, the UE performs measurements on the UTRAN

target frequency. Inter-RAT B1 measurement reporting where the Inter RAT neighbor reaches a

higher level than the threshold level is used. The only UEs that are selected are those that

support inter-RAT handover to UTRAN and trigger a B1 measurement report on the target

cell.

UE handover is performed using normal S1 handover preparation and the RRC connection

reconfiguration procedures.

### 3.1.4 Offload Capacity

The ExternalUtranCellFDD.lbUtranCellOffloadCapacity attribute is used to

moderate the offload amount directed to the target UTRAN cell. The amount of offload to a

specific target UTRAN cell is proportional to the

ExternalUtranCellFDD.lbUtranCellOffloadCapacity attribute of that target

UTRAN cell.

Different EUtranCellFDD.lbUtranOffloadThreshold or

EUtranCellTDD.lbUtranOffloadThreshold attribute values can be used for

E-UTRAN cells to direct offload amounts to UTRAN cells available for offload.

The offload amount is also proportional to the degree the subscription ratio of the source

cell exceeds the value of the EUtranCellFDD.lbUtranOffloadThreshold or

EUtranCellTDD.lbUtranOffloadThreshold attribute. The difference in the

amount to be offloaded in each round of load balancing action and the amount to be contained

in the E-UTRAN cells depends on the ratio between the

ExternalUtranCellFDD.lbUtranCellOffloadCapacity attribute and the

EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity values configured for the source

cell and the related inter-frequency load balancing target cells.

In case of combination with the Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature, the functionality of the

EUtranCellFDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity or

EUtranCellTDD.cellSubscriptionCapacity attribute can be replaced by the

Automated Cell Capacity Estimation feature, which automatically

determines and configures the cell capacity. The principle of configuring

qciSubscriptionQuanta will then be changed. For more information, see

the document Automated Cell Capacity Estimation.

For more information on inter-frequency load balancing, see Inter-frequency Load Balancing.

## 3.2 Load Management and MP Load Control

The objective for the Load Management functions in the eNodeB is to balance or offload load

when possible. However, the focus is on the air interface load. During the execution of Load

Management functions the MP processor load can increase. The Load Management functions are

temporarily paused if MP Load Control state is higher than NOT HIGH to not

affect general traffic handling. For more information, see Basic Load Management.

# 4 Network Impact of Inter-RAT Offload WCDMA

The feature affects system capacity and handover.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves capacity on all the available and configured UTRAN cells.

The feature enables traffic offload to the UTRAN network if the traffic load in the E-UTRAN

cells exceeds a configured level. It allows the system capacity to increase and reduces the

risk for a UE to be trapped in an overused E-UTRAN cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA feature redistributes users in connected mode from E-UTRAN

cells to UTRAN by means of traffic load triggered PS handover. This feature enables an

increase in the number of PS handovers. The handover is typically performed in good radio

conditions.

The handover cause (S1) value for the Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA feature is set according

to the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCauseCodeS1SourceTriggersOffload

attribute.

# 7 Activate Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover and IRAT Offload from LTE features are activated.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011478 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011478 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

The feature has configurations related to load balancing and subscription

parameters.

Allow Load Balancing Actions

To allow load balancing actions, the cell relations that require load balancing must

be configured at feature activation. Set the

UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute to

OFFLOAD.

## 9.1 Load Balancing Relation Configuration

Load balancing relations are configured in the source cell towards each target cell. Setting

the UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute to OFFLOAD

activates load balancing to the UTRAN target cell.

The UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute activates load balancing in

one direction from the E-UTRAN cell to the UTRAN cell.

The Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload feature can

automatically determine and configure the UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing

attribute.

## 9.2 Subscription Parameters Configuration

The operation requirement for the Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA feature is that the

QciProfilePredefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta and

QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciSubscriptionQuanta attributes are configured

the same as for the Inter-frequency Load Balancing feature. For more information, see Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

## 9.3 Configuration of Load Balancing Action and UE Selection

The LoadBalancingFunction.lbThreshold and

LoadBalancingFunction.lbCeiling attributes configure load balancing

sensitivity and the maximum rate of load balancing actions. These parameters are defined at

RBS level and apply to all load balancing relations in the RBS to UTRAN cells. In many

deployments, the default values of these parameters are sufficient.

The LoadBalancingFunction.lbThreshold attribute can be configured with a

higher value than theLoadBalancingFunction.lbCeiling attribute. The effect

of this can result in the load gap between the cells not closing entirely.

QCI dependent UE selection criteria can be configured for the individual UTRAN frequencies if

the Service Specific Load Management feature is activated. For more information, see section

Load Balancing Action in Service Specific Load Management.
