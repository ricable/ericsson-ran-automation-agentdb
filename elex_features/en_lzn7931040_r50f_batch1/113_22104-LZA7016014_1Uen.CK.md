UE must support 4-port CRS.

# 3 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package Operation

The 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package provides support for LTE downlink

four-antenna transmission. The increased spatial diversity and better radio beamforming

enabled by 4-way transmission results in higher cell throughput and coverage.

## 3.1 UE Channel State Information

In the DL, the UE estimates the spatial properties of the radio channel by measuring the DL

reference symbols from the different antenna ports. This is used to give feedback to the

eNodeB so that it allocates an appropriate amount of resources to make an optimal antenna

mapping. The feedback is sent either on the PUCCH if no PUSCH resources are scheduled or on

PUSCH if PUSCH resources are scheduled.

The UE can provide either periodic or a-periodic CSI in TM3 or TM4 to assist downlink link

adaptation and scheduling.

## 3.2 Downlink Scheduling and Link Adaptation

Downlink Scheduling

When a UE is selected for scheduling, the first step is to select a DCI format.

Based on the resource allocation types for the DCI format, the DL Scheduler assigns a set

of PRBs to the UE. This set of PRB resources, together with the preferred number of

codewords and number of bits for transmission, serve as input to the link adaptation

function.

Link Adaptation

Link Adaptation performs transport format selection to enforce the quality requirement

while using the available resources in an efficient way. Transport format selection includes

selecting the modulation and coding scheme and transport block size. High rank, high layer

transmissions can use larger transport blocks, as described in 3GPP TS

36.213, Table 7.1.7.2.2-1.

After reception, the UE feedbacks separate HARQ acknowledgments for each transmitted

codeword.

## 3.3 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package Impact on Layer 1 Processing

When the DL scheduler process is finalized, the result is a set of downlink assignments, that

are provided as input to the Layer 1 processing unit. The downlink scheduling assignments are

sent to the UE on PDCCH.

The process for each downlink assignment differs depending on the

number of codewords in use.

For TM3 and TM4, the layer mapping and precoding are as follows:

- The number of codewords can be set to one or two. The codewords to layer mapping for spatial multiplexing is performed as specified by Section 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 36.211. Then the layer-mapped codewords are precoded according to Section 6.3.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 36.211.
- The output after precoding is four sequences of complex-valued symbols, which are mapped to resource elements for transmission on antenna ports 0, 1, 2, and 3.

# 4 Network Impact of 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package

Capacity and Performance

The 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature provides capacity gain. The

DL peak throughput and aggregate cell throughput are improved compared with that of

2-antenna systems and that of 4×2 MIMO four-antenna systems using Category 5

UEs.

Coverage

The 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature offers comparable coverage

to the 4×2 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package, when using the same antenna

configuration.

Implementation

The 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature supports both TM3 and

TM4.

# 6 Performance of 4x4 Quad Antenna Downlink Performance Package

KPIs

This feature uses existing KPIs for system performance evaluation and monitoring.

Measurable DL throughput gain is expected with this feature compared to 2TX TM3.

It is preferable to measure the PM counters in the network having high traffic

activity. The measurement needs to compare calculated DL UE throughput to the

performance achieved by 2TX TM3 or 4x2 MIMO TM4 under the same conditions. Other DL

throughput-related KPIs such as DL PDCP Cell Throughput can also be used to measure

DL throughput gain.

There must not be any negative impact on the KPIs which are not related to DL

throughput.

## 9.1 Considerations for 4TX Deployment

When switching from 2TX to 4TX deployment,

it

is necessary to retune the enumeration CfiMode, CRS scaling, handover (HO)

thresholds (qRxLevMin, A1/A2/A5/B2 thresholds).

Settings

that were optimized for 2TX are not necessarily optimum for 4TX.

- For the same cell power and CRS scaling, the measured RSRP at a given location in the cell configured is lowered by 3 dB going from 2TX to 4TX. This is because of the way RSRP is defined by 3GPP standard. The change in RSRP levels necessitates the retuning of HO thresholds. To maintain the HO boundary, it is necessary to adjust the CRS scaling, i.e., crsGain, as explained below.
- Consider setting enumeration CfiMode to 4 or 5. This mitigates the fact that there are fewer CCEs for PDCCH with 4TX compared to 2TX. The introduction of two extra CRSs comes at the expense of REs available for PDCCH and PDSCH.

The crsGain setting does not change the RSRP level and CRS interference

level in the same

way.

For example, if the same crsGain and cell power are maintained, the change

in RSRP from 2TX to 4TX is -3.01 dB. However the change in CRS interference is -1.25

dB.

- The reason for the discrepancy of 3.01 dB - 1.25 dB = 1.76 dB is due to the RS power spectral density being halved from 2TX to 4TX but the number of RS resource elements increased by 1.5 times rather than two-fold because antenna ports 2 and 3 have half of the number of RS REs as compared to antenna ports 0 and 1. In case of one PRB, 16 REs are used for CRS in 2TX (8 from port 0 and 8 from port 1) but there are 24 REs used for CRS in 4TX (8 from port 0, 8 from port 1, 4 from port 2 and 4 from port 3). The resulting total CRS power of 4TX is 1.76 dB (10log(24/16)) higher than the total CRS power of 2TX. For details on the CRS RE locations, see Figure 6.10.1.2-1 in TS36.211 (v14.2.0).

For a better illustration,

given

a same cell power and a set of

crsGain

settings

for 4TX and 2TX, the 4TX RSRP relative to 2TX RSRP [dB] is calculated and the results are

tabulated in Table 5.

Also, under the same

condition, 4TX CRS interference relative to 2TX CRS interference [dB]

is calculated and the results are tabulated in Table 6.

The

following

example

is highlighted

Table 5 and

using a different

font.

Assume 2TX deployment was with crsGain= 0. For 4TX deployment:

- If crsGain= 0 is kept, the 4TX RSRP is 3.01 dB lower than the 2TX RSRP and 4TX CRS interference is 1.25dB lower than the 2TX counterpart.
- If the previous HO boundary is to be kept, the crsGain may need to be increased by 300, so set 4TX crsGain to 300. In that case, the 4TX RSRP relative to 2TX RSRP is only -0.01dB. However, 4TX CRS interference is 1.75dB higher than the 2TX counterpart, which has negative impact on the 4TX throughput.
- Setting the 4TX crsGain to 177 reduces the CRS interference to 0.52 dB higher than the 2TX counterpart. However the 4TX RSRP becomes 1.24 dB lower than the 2TX RSRP, which impacts the HO boundary.

Generally

it is difficult to maintain RSRP parity and CRS interference parity

simultaneously

from 2TX to 4TX.

Therefore

a trade-off

must

be made. If the cluster is not coverage limited, it is a good option to maintain CRS

interference parity.

Otherwise,maintaining

CRS interference parity is a good option. All of those need to be considered

in the performance comparison.

There are deployment scenarios for 4TX where cell power is doubled compared to 2TX baseline.

To analyze the resulting performance gain, view this deployment as a two step solution:

1. Upgrade from 2TX to 4TX with the same cell power.
2. Change the configuration to double the cell power but keep all other settings unchanged.

Note the following about performance impacts

- If the same crsGain setting is kept, the RSRP from antenna port 0 at a given location in a cell of interest is maintained from 2TX to 4TX. As such, HO boundaries are maintained.
- When the cell powers for the cell of interest and all its neighboring cells are doubled while all other settings are unchanged, performance gain of 4TX compared with 2TX baseline can vary for different downlink signals, channels and in different scenarios. For details, see Table 4. Table 4 Performance impacts of doubling cell power Signals and Channels Performance impacts CRS For CRS, the CRS signal power per CRS RE is unchanged in 4TX as compared with 2TX baseline. CRS is used by UEs for channel estimation. However, inter-cell interference power from the neighboring PDSCH traffic colliding on the CRS REs can increase as the cell powers of neighboring cells are doubled. This means that the channel estimation performance at the UE side may be degraded. This can impact the performance of downlink signals and channels. PDSCH For PDSCH, the signal power per PDSCH RE is doubled from 2TX to 4TX. Interference power from neighboring PDSCH region is potentially doubled as well due to cell power being doubled at neighboring cells. In general, PDSCH performance depends on signal to interference plus noise (SINR) as explained below. If a UE is located where the interference is a dominant factor in the interference plus noise component, the SINR changes and there is little performance gain in PDSCH. If a UE is in a location where the interference is not a dominant factor in the interference plus noise component, the SINR increases and there is a performance gain. PDCCH For PDCCH, signal power per PDCCH RE is doubled from 2TX to 4TX but inter-cell interference power is potentially doubled as well. The resulting PDCCH performance, similarly as that for PDSCH, shows some gain for a UE in a location where the interference is not dominant but little gain if interference is dominant.Note: With enhanced PDCCH link adaptation feature enabled, the PDCCH performance gain can be translated into lower PDCCH CCE utilization.

For a better illustration, given a doubled cell power but a set of crsGain

settings for 4TX and 2TX, the 4TX RSRP relative to 2TX RSRP [dB] is calculated and the results

are tabulated in Table 7. Under the same condition,

4TX CRS interference relative to 2TX CRS interference [dB] is calculated and the results are

tabulated in Table 8.

## 9.2 Radio Building Block Configuration

An RBB defines a unique way of combining radio units in one sector with connections to

Baseband units and the antenna system.

The RBB configurations that support 4-way transmit diversity and spatial multiplexing are

listed in Radio Node Configurations.

## 9.3 Baseband Unit Configuration

A Baseband unit provides switching, traffic management, timing, baseband processing, and

radio interfacing.

Cell configuration limitations with different Baseband Radio Node types for this feature are

described in Radio Node Configurations.

The following documents provide further information about Baseband unit configuration:

- Control Channel Dimensioning

## 9.4 Recommended Transmitter Antenna Configurations

The following antenna types and configurations can be used:

- Four co-polarized correlated antenna elements
- Four co-polarized uncorrelated antenna elements
- Two columns of closely spaced cross-polarized antenna elements
- Two spatially separated columns of cross-polarized antenna elements

Although all four antenna configurations are supported, the recommended configuration depends

on the extent that 4×4 MIMO capable UEs are deployed in the network compared to UEs only

capable of 4×2 MIMO as well as on the transmission mode (TM3 or TM4) and on the number of UEs

moving at medium or high speed. There is a fundamental trade-off among maximizing beamforming

gain, maximizing the diversity gain, maximizing the rank of the RF channel, and maximizing the

robustness against fading.

For already deployed antenna configuration with configuration B, C, or D, in general, the

cost of physically changing the antenna configuration can outweigh the marginal performance

benefit that can arise from that antenna optimization effort. Therefore, customers need to

perform field testing to assess the cost versus benefit of different antenna

configurations.

## 9.5 Baseband Port to RF Branch Mapping with Same Polarization

Baseband port to RF branch mapping is chosen depending on performance requirements.

Field testing is recommended to decide which configuration provides the best

performance.

When using two columns of cross-polarized antennas, for example, +45 and -45, the first and

second Baseband ports can be mapped with the same polarization or with different

polarization.

Mapping with the same polarization provides higher beamforming gain for PDSCH in TM4 and,

therefore, higher cell throughput. When using this radio configuration, the following mapping

applies:

- The first and second RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to antennas with the same polarization, for example, -45.
- The third and fourth RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to other antennas with different polarization, for example, +45.

radio unit with RBB44\_1D and antenna physical cabling ABB4\_1A.

3. RfBranch 3 connecting to radio unit 2 RfPort A and antenna port (A, +45)
4. RfBranch 4 connecting to radio unit 2 RfPort B and antenna port (B, +45)

Deterministic carrier allocation (DCA) is used if the order of the branches is important to

the Baseband algorithm. With DCA, the Baseband algorithm does not try to re-allocate the

carrier branches if the requested resources are unavailable or already in use. For more

information about DCA, see Features for Radio Configurations in the Radio Node

Configurations library.

Node library.

## 9.6 Baseband Port to RF Branch Mapping with Different Polarization

Baseband port to RF branch mapping is chosen depending on performance requirements.

Field testing is recommended to decide which configuration provides the best

performance.

When using two columns of cross-polarized antennas, for example, +45 and -45, the first

and second Baseband ports can be mapped with the same polarization or with different

polarization.

Mapping with different polarization provides higher diversity gain for common channels

which benefits UEs located on the cell edge. When using this radio configuration, the

following mapping applies:

- The first and second RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to antennas with different polarization.
- The third and fourth RF branches in the list of the SectorCarrier.rfBranchTxRef attribute point to the RF branches connected to other antennas with different polarization.

## 9.7 Recommendations for RF Cable Lengths

It is recommended to use RF cables of equal length to connect the radio to the antenna. This

is to avoid introducing differential delays between the different antennas.

Alternatively, it is possible to use RF cables of unequal length, but in this case

potentially different dlTrafficDelay values have to be managed on a per

RfBranch basis. To ensure correct delay compensation for each TX antenna,

dlTrafficDelay settings have to be set accurately to reflect the

installed RF cables between the radio and the antenna.

Various transmission modes react differently to RF cable length. See the following list for

reference:

- Performance of TM3 is not sensitive to RF cables with unequal length.
- Performance of TM4 is sensitive to RF cables with unequal length. Therefore, it is recommended to use the attribute dlTrafficDelay to compensate for the length difference between the RF cables in a way that the length difference in time is within 1 ns for all channel bandwidth.

Example 1   Configuring dlTrafficDelay to Compensate for RF Cable Propagation Delay

If the RF cable for antenna 0 is 2 meters, and the RF cables for other antennas are 1

meter, the dlTrafficDelay setting for antenna 0, 1, 2, and 3 should be

set to 8 ns, 4 ns, 4 ns, and 4 ns respectively. This is to indicate that the antenna 0 path

has an extra delay of 4 ns as compared with other antenna paths. Once set, all these delays

are compensated for to ensure that the TX signals to all the antenna elements exhibit the

correct DL timing. Here, we assume a propagation delay of 4 ns per meter.
