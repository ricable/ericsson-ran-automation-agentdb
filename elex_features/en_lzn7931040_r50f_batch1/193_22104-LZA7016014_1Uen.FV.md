Summary

The purpose of the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is to enable downlink

carrier aggregation between cells not on the same eNodeB.

The feature has the following benefits:

- The set of cells considered for use as SCells is expanded across multiple eNodeBs. As a result, UEs can find a better set of cells for carrier aggregation, resulting in increased overall throughput.
- Better utilization of eNodeBs in the network.

Hardware

For hardware requirements, see Features for Radio Configurations.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the feature:

- If more ESCells are configured than the allowed maximum number, the connections do not work as expected. For more information about the maximum number of ESCells a primary eNodeB can use for each RAN Compute unit, see Features for Radio Configurations.
- If the Baseband power savings function is activated using the PowerSaving.bbPowerSavingStatus attribute, the capacity for the ESCells is reduced. For more information about the configuration guidelines related to Baseband power savings, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity and Features for Radio Configurations.
- With a TDD PCell, the ESCell must also be a TDD cell.
- The number of X2 tunnels for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation is limited to maximum 12 for each RAN Compute unit.
- The maximum capacity of user-data over an X2 tunnel is 630 kilobits for each TTI.
- The maximum number of ESCells that can be scheduled for each TTI by the master eNodeB is limited to three.
- The feature does not support LAA ESCells.
- TM9 is not supported in inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation TDD SCells.
- The feature supports the following bandwidths: 5 MHz 10 MHz 15 MHz 20 MHz

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

With the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature, a UE uses downlink transmission

resources from partially or fully overlapping cells belonging to different eNodeBs.

Carrier Aggregation with Cells Deployed on Different eNodeBs

The feature enables Release 10 UEs to receive downlink data from

cells that belong to different eNodeBs or the same eNodeB.

The primary eNodeB forwards user data over the X2 tunnel to the external eNodeB where the

SCell (ESCell) is deployed. The maximum capacity of the X2 tunnel needs to be

considered.

Figure 1

Carrier Aggregation with a Small Cell Deployed in the Coverage Area of a Macro

CellCarrier Aggregation with Cells Deployed on Different eNodeBs

A small ESCell belonging to a small eNodeB is deployed in the

coverage area of a macro PCell (fully overlapping the ESCell) in addition

to an existing SCell. In this case, it is possible to perform inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation to utilize bandwidth from both the small ESCell and the macro PCell

simultaneously for subscribers that are within the coverage of the small ESCell. For

subscribers that are within the coverage of the PCell and the SCell, inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation can be performed as if the cells were local.

Carrier Aggregation between eNodeBs Running Different Software Versions

The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature can operate across different software versions

with the Software Release Interoperability for Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation enhancement.

As a result, the downlink transmission to the UE is seamlessly integrated regardless of the

different software releases among eNodeBs.

Software interoperability between RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group

4 and higher is supported with a gap of up to six quarterly software release versions.

The software release compatibility between eNodeBs for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation can

be observed through the TermPointToENB.interEnbCaProtVerActive and the

TermPointToENB.interEnbSwCompatibilityState attributes.

Example 1   Carrier Aggregation between eNodeBs Running Different Software Versions

In this example, a UE employs downlink transmission resources from cells belonging to

different eNodeBs with inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation. The PCell and one ESCell run

software release 19.Q1, whereas the other two ESCells run software releases 18.Q3 and 18.Q4

respectively.

Figure 3   Carrier Aggregation between eNodeBs Running Different Software Versions

## 3.1 Process Steps

Inter-eNodeB Tunnel Setup

Proprietary tunnels are set up automatically between eNodeBs hosting the PCell and the

ESCells over the X2 interface. The tunnels are coordinating the scheduling between cells and

relaying transport blocks between the PCells and the ESCells

The tunnels are automatically set up upon the initial activation of the Inter-eNodeB

Carrier Aggregation feature, if at least one cell has the state UNLOCKED or

ENABLED on the same LBMId as the tunnel.

As a result of a successful tunnel creation, a TermPointToLbm MO

instance is created under the TermPointToENB MO instance.

Cleaning up Inter-eNodeB Tunnels

When the last cell relation using a tunnel becomes inoperable, the tunnel is removed

automatically, and the corresponding TermPointToLbm MO instance is

deleted. The tunnels can also be removed manually by locking the

TermPointToENB MO. For tunnel removal, at least one cell has to have

the state UNLOCKED or ENABLED on the same

TermPointToLbm.termPointToLbmId as the tunnel. After unlocking the

TermPointToENB MO, if the conditions for inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation are met, the tunnels are created again.

Dynamic External Secondary Cell Selection

To achieve dynamic selection of an ESCell for carrier aggregation, the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute must be set to

ENABLED. The attribute is automatically enabled if the

following conditions are all met:

- The ExternalEUtranCellFDD.remoteCellState or ExternalEUtranCellTDD.remoteCellState attribute of a related MO instance is set to ENABLED.
- An X2 tunnel is set up between the two eNodeBs.
- The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is activated.
- The Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD feature must be activated if the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.remoteCellState is set to ENABLED.
- To allow the following cells to be selected as ESCells, the related licenses must be activated in the primary eNodeB: 4 TX port cells TDD AAS cells FDD AAS cells 8T8R TDD cells

Secondary Cell Configuration and Deconfiguration

The SCell configuration and deconfiguration algorithms do not distinguish between local or

external SCells. For more information, see Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation and 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension.

Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation

The SCell activation and deactivation algorithms are the same as for local or external

SCells. For more information, see Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation and 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension.

The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation, LTE Broadcast, and Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast

Subframes features can be used together. However, UEs with ESCell configured at the time of

any eMBMS service change in this cell have their ESCell deactivated for the duration of the

connection of the current UEs.

TDD Cell Configuration for PCell

The ENodeBFunction.interEnbCaTddPCellEnabled attribute is used to enable

or disable a TDD cell for Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation as PCell. If the PCell is a TDD

cell, the ESCell must also be a TDD cell.

## 3.2 Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation on the Same eNodeB

It is supported to use both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation on the

same eNodeB.

The benefits of using both features are the following:

- More carrier aggregation partners are enabled.
- Carrier aggregation on border areas between two networks is improved, as more ESCell candidates are allowed in the border area between Elastic RAN and X2 connected eNodeBs. This leads to better utilization of multiple eNodeBs in this area.
- It is supported to use the same cell as both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation partner.

When both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are activated on the

eNodeB, the value of the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPrioritizationDisabled parameter

determines which is established first. The parameter has the following values:

In case the type of link intended to be established is Elastic RAN and instead

Inter-eNodeB is established, it is advised to check with

EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail what licenses are

active on both eNodeBs.

The Inter Node Feature

Incompatibility alarm is raised when the Elastic RAN or Inter-eNodeB

Carrier Aggregation connection tunnel triggered by the Automatic SCell Management

feature cannot be set up. The alarm can be suppressed when the following conditions are

all met:

- The tunnel setup is automatically triggered by the Automatic SCell Management feature.
- The tunnel setup fails because one of the following conditions is true: The Elastic RAN feature is not activated in the remote node. The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is not activated in the remote node. The Elastic RAN and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are not activated in the remote node.
- The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute is set to true.

If the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is

suppressed, the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_ASM\_TRIGGERED\_ALARM\_SUPPRESSED event is

reported.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the benefits of the enhancement:

- Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation counters EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActDlIeNbSum EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfiguredDlIeNbSum EUtranCellFDD.pmCaScheduledDlIeNbSum EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt

# 4 Network Impact of Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature allows the UEs to use cells as carrier

aggregation ESCells. The feature expands the available set of SCells, which leads to an

overall increase in throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The set of cells considered for use as SCells is expanded across multiple eNodeBs. As

a result, UEs can find a better set of cells with which to perform carrier

aggregation, leading to an increase in overall throughput.

UEs using external cells consume similar resources as UEs using local cells. PCells

get additional overhead when forwarding transport blocks over the X2 interface to

external eNodeBs.

Performance can vary depending on the software releases of the

eNodeBs. This is because the signal translation of different releases between the

eNodeBs results in extra processing. Interoperation with a short time gap between

the releases is recommended to reduce the processing load.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 LTE Backhaul Network Characteristics

The following aspects must be considered before attempting to deploy this feature:

| Considerations about congestion                                  |    | Inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation requires a congestion-free transport path between the             primary eNodeB and secondary eNodeB. Congestion typically leads to an increase in delay,             delay variation, and possibly packet loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Considerations about packet loss                                 |    | Inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation user data traffic destined to the external cell uses             backhaul transport network resources, increasing resource consumption over the X2 path             between the PCell and external SCell eNodeBs. User packets lost in the X2 backhaul             network result in wasted radio resources and can result in retransmission by the PCell eNodeB over the backhaul network, further increasing the network traffic.  Control traffic for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation requires a congestion-free,             low-loss backhaul transport network. Control packets that are lost result in an order of             magnitude loss (waste) in radio resources. |

| Considerations about packet reordering                           |    | Inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation requires a transport path between the primary eNodeB             and secondary eNodeB that does not introduce packet reordering. If reordering occurs, it             has the same effect as packet loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                                                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Considerations about inter-eNodeB delay                          |    | Inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation requires a relatively low-delay transport path between             the primary eNodeB and secondary eNodeB.

# 7 Activate Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is available if something goes wrong.
- The Carrier Aggregation feature is activated on both eNodeBs.Note: One eNodeB hosting the PCell and the other one hosting the SCell.
- The eNodeBs configured for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation must be time and phase synchronized using either GNSS (GPS) or IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization. It is not recommended to use the less strict accuracy of 0.5 ms that can be achieved by the Partial Timing Support (PTS) with relaxed network limits enhancement. The synchronization reference is configured as described in Synchronization and Manage Network Synchronization.Note: The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature remains enabled regardless of any time and phase synchronization availability or deviation. If the time and phase synchronization deviation exceeds the limit as defined in FDD and TDD on same eNodeB feature, TDD ESCells are disabled and not available for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation. The PTS with relaxed network limits enhancement enables the nodes to operate within a time error of 500 µs.
- The TermPointToENB.interEnbSwCompatibilityState attribute is set to COMPATIBLE, indicating that the version check is passed. Inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation is not supported for any two eNodeBs running incompatible software versions.
- The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED for the intended ESCell candidate. Note: The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute can be set to AUTO if the following conditions are fulfilled: The Automatic SCell Management feature is operable. The EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set to ALLOWED.
- The ExternalEUtranCellFDD.remoteCellState attribute is set to ENABLED.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011983 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is activated at least for a week. This ensures that troubleshooting data is

available if something goes wrong.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011983 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

multiple software

releases.

| Feature Name:           | Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4469 R3                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0564 R5                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement enables Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation to operate across different

software versions. It provides the ability to have active inter-eNodeB tunnels with

different software versions.

Performance can

vary depending on the releases involved, so it is recommended for users to

inter-operate with short release time gap

loads.

Software interoperability

is

supported with

at

least

three previous software versions. For more information regarding supported software

versions and interoperability type, see the Release Notes.

- TermPointToENB.interEnbCaProtVerActive
- ENodeBFunction.interNodalProtVersions

Interfaces

- No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.d: 19.Q1: Coexistence of Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

This enhancement allows the use of both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation on the same

eNodeB.

| Feature Name:           | Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation  Elastic RAN   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4469  FAJ 121 4609                      |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation  Elastic RAN       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0564  FAJ 801 0568                      |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                             |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                             |

This enhancement allows the simultaneous use of both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation features on the same eNodeB by removing the restriction of coexistence of

Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features on same eNodeB. Parallel use

of both of those features enables more carrier aggregation partners, and improves

carrier aggregation on border areas between two networks. This enhancement also allows

to use a single Cell as E-RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation partner at the same

time.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement provides more External SCell candidates in the border area between

Elastic RAN and X2 connected eNodeBs that leads to an increase in utilization of

multiple eNodeBs in this area.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node  DU Radio Node                    |
| Access Type:            | LTE, MI                                               |

Benefits

Both the Category M Access feature and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature

can be enabled on the SCells if the cell bandwidth is higher than 5 MHz.

Capacity and Performance

Enabling the Category M Access feature reduces the resources available for external

LTE transmission on the SCell that is configured for the Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation feature.

Operation

The feature enhancement is most beneficial on TDD-TDD inter-eNodeB connected sites.

On such sites, the enhancement has the following benefits:

- Extended carrier aggregation possibilities
- Increased spectrum utilization

Capacity and Performance

The performance of the feature enhancement is affected by X2 latency.

The feature enhancement might decrease the following capabilities:

- AAS performance can degrade as a result of SCell or ESCell connected UEs operating with high priority on TM3.
- On intra-eNodeB connected sites with good carrier aggregation opportunities, the PDCP throughput of carrier aggregating UEs might decrease as the lower throughput of ESCells decreases the throughput gain of local SCells. This impact can be observed as the PDCP Throughput of CA Users KPI decreases. PDCP Throughput of CA Users

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                          |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation between RAN

Compute units in RAN Compute group 1, 2, and 3, which are in limited development

phase, and RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 4 and higher. Network flexibility

is ensured between eNodeBs that run different software release versions.
