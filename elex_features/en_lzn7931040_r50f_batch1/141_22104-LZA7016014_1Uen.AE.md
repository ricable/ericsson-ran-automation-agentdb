Summary

The UE Location at Release feature enables the use of the User Location

Information IE. This IE contains the UE location at the time of a

released call.

This feature provides the cell level location when a UE context or an E-RAB is

released. This information, together with the cause of the E-RAB release, is used

for call-drop analysis.

Additional Information

For more information and related topics, see 3GPP TS 36.413, S1 Application

Protocol (S1AP).

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of UE Location at Release

# 3 Feature Operation of UE Location at Release

This feature uses S1AP messages to provide the operator with the IE User Location

Information.

The feature UE Location at Release provides the operator with the IE User Location

Information for all released calls in LTE RAN.

The information is provided by the eNodeB to the MME in the following S1AP messages:

- E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE
- E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION
- UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE

The IE User Location Information contains the following parameters:

- The tracking area of the serving cell
- The E-UTRAN CGI of the serving cell

# 7 Activate UE Location at Release

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011933 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate UE Location at Release

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011933 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
