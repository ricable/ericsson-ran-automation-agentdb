Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Network

Requirements

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a

valid license key must be installed and the feature must be explicitly activated by

setting a MOM attribute.

- There must be a PTP Grandmaster present in the network.
- This feature requires that the PTP Slave clock has IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity towards a PTP Grandmaster located in the transport network.
- For PTP reference, use roundtrip delay for PTP packets must be less than 1 s. PDV for PTP packets must be less than 10 ms. PDV is defined as a 99% (+/-2.57 sigma) confidence interval of the delay variation in one direction, that is, uplink or downlink.

Requirements for the G.8265.1 Profile

- The PTP Grandmaster must support the G.8265.1 profile.

# 3 Feature Operation of IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization

Feature

Operation

IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization feature operates to synchronize the frequency of

the slave clock in a node to a master clock provided by a PTP

Grandmaster.

All radio nodes need to be frequency synchronized. If the node does not need time

synchronization, the IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization is one of the optional

features to provide the frequency synchronization required to meet 3GPP

requirements.

A PTP slave

clock uses PTP protocol to synchronize to a PTP

Grandmaster

clock which enables the node to recover frequency from a PRC

source. This feature operates according to G.8265.1/Y.1365.1.

PTP packets are sent towards a PTP Grandmaster using UDP over IPv4 or IPv6 with

unicast

addressing.

It is possible to configure a node with up to

eight

slave-only ordinary

clocks, that

is synchronization

references.

Each synchronization reference is a slave clock and has a corresponding master clock

as shown in Figure 1. Each PTP slave clock is configured toward a

PTP Grandmaster. The PTP Grandmaster can be any Ericsson recommended PTP Grandmaster

for network synchronization.

Figure 1   IEEE 1588 Synchronization References

On Baseband

Radio Nodes,

the

PTP reference status can be read out from the attribute

BoundaryOrdinaryClock.clockStatus and attribute

PtpBcOcPort.ptpPortStatus.

On DU Radio

Nodes, status is represented in

PacketFrequencySyncRef.packetSyncStatus

attribute.

The node requests a PTP over IP unicast session from the PTP Grandmaster. The PTP

Grandmaster must be synchronized by the PRC. When the session is granted from the

PTP Grandmaster, the node locks to it. PDV requirements of the IP connection must be

within the required limits.

Operational Process

Figure 2   Clock Reference Generation

with

PTP

The time server

(PTP Grandmaster) and

radio

node exchange messages and generate a series of

timestamps:

1. The PTP Grandmaster sends a Sync message and notes the time T1 at which it was sent.
2. The node receives the Sync message and notes the time of reception, T2.
3. The PTP Grandmaster conveys the timestamp T1 to the node by embedding T1 in the Sync message, or by sending T1 embedded in a separate Follow\_Up message.
4. The node sends a Delay\_Req message to the PTP Grandmaster and notes the time T3, at which it was sent.
5. The PTP Grandmaster receives the Delay\_Req message and notes the time of reception, T4.
6. The master conveys the timestamp T4 to the slave embedded in a Delay\_Resp message.

At the conclusion of this exchange of messages, the

radio

node possesses all four

timestamps.

These can be used to compute the frequency difference between the PTP Grandmaster

and the

node

clock. The

node

clock adjusts its frequency to correspond to the frequency of the PTP

Grandmaster.

# 4 Network Impact of 1588 IEEE Frequency Synchronization

Capacity and Performance

Using the IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization feature is one method to solve the

requirement for frequency synchronization of the Uu interface.

The IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization feature uses unicast transmission and the

node requests the time server to send eight

PTP

Sync messages per second. If the server uses Follow\_Up

messages, these are sent at the same rate. For each Sync

message,

the node receives it generates a Delay\_Req message, up

to at most eight

Delay\_Req messages per second.

If

the server send messages at a higher rate than the node requested, the node filters

out excessive

messages. For

best performance, PTP packets should have high priority.

The required message rate

depends

on the network quality. The message rates are continuous, also when the slave clock

has entered locked mode. If the node can lock the clock for the Uu interface to the

time server,

it enables stable system and performance

behavior.

references of different kinds to use in an RBS. It is also used to activate the

license of the IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization feature.

The PacketFrequencySyncRef MO is used to manage an individual

IEEE1588 Frequency Synchronization reference.

The IpAccessHostEt MO represents an IP host that is used to send

## 9.2 Network Configuration Requirements

The PTP

Grandmasters

must be defined as alternative synchronization references in priority order. Ericsson

recommends providing connectivity to two or more PTP

Grandmasters

to increase network reliability.

Slave clocks get information about the quality of master clocks through the PTP protocol. The

clock quality includes information about clock class and clock accuracy. A slave clock chooses the

PTP

Grandmaster

with the highest priority if it provides a clock with sufficiently good quality (according to

predefined values for clock class and clock accuracy).

The transport address must be specified for each PTP

Grandmaster.

This can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a domain name.

IEEE 1588 defines PTP domain numbers. These are used to define logical groupings of clocks

that synchronize to each other. A slave clock can only use a master clock if it belongs to the

same PTP domain. With unicast

transmission,

it is not required that different domain numbers are used in different domains.

In addition to the performance of the PTP

Grandmaster,

the

node

capability to fulfill the performance requirements also depends on the PDV introduced for the

PTP messages by the transport network infrastructure. The transport network infrastructure

must assure delay variation performance for a sufficient set of packets carrying PTP messages,

so the

node

can lock its clock to the PTP

Grandmaster

with required performance. This requires a QoS aware transport network that prioritizes

packets carrying PTP messages. A transport network

provides

different delay variation for IP packets with different priorities, as defined by the DSCP

values of the IP packets. IP packets carrying PTP messages

are

to be marked with appropriate DSCP values.

The IEEE 1588 Frequency Synchronization feature does not require that intermediate nodes in

the transport network support Boundary Clock or Transparent Clock functionality.
