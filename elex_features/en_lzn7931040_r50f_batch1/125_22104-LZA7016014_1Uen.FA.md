# 1 Subscriber Triggered Mobility Overview

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature enables individual control of mobility

characteristics for a UE based on SPID.

Summary

The use of SPID makes it possible to create and sell differentiated subscription types. For

example, a high-rate subscription can offer the highest possible throughput for the

end-user, whereas a low rate subscription offers lower throughput for the end-user.

If not used, the node cannot differentiate the UE based on its subscription profile,

so the node gives every user priority and throughput based on the default

criteria.

Telephone-only subscribers or low data-rate subscriptions can be directed to move to a RAN

that offers lower data-rate networks than E-UTRAN.

With the RFPM function of this feature, the operator can configure new frequencies and

priorities that only affect a given SPID value. This enables the operator to define

"test-UE" subscriptions as the only UEs that are affected by the new frequency and

priorities. Once tested and proven, the configuration can be applied for all UEs.

This reduces or removes the need to temporarily disable part of the RAN to try out

new configurations.

The ORC function of this feature uses SPID to determine if a UE is allowed to perform incoming

handover to cells that are in mode "reserved for operator use". Only UEs with

specific SPID values are allowed access. For further information on cells in

"reserved for operator use" mode, see 3GPP TS 36.304 section 5.3.1.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The network requirements for the feature activation of the part handling RFPM are the

following:

- A license key must be activated to operate the RFPM.
- The target RAT must have its frequency priorities configured in a consistent way with the SPID handling in the E-UTRAN, otherwise the UE could experience a "ping-pong" effect, being pushed back and forth between the two RATs.
- The MME must be able to receive the RAT/Frequency Selection Priority when identifying the subscriber and map this to a SPID that is sent to the node.
- The node must be configured with IRAT inter-frequencies in the eNodeB during network configurations or by SON features. These frequencies are used when evaluating which frequencies configured for RFPM are allowed to be used for RFPM.

The network requirements for the feature activation of the part handling ORC are the

following:

- A license key must be activated to operate the ORC.
- The MME must be able to receive the RAT/Frequency Selection Priority when identifying the subscriber and map this to a SPID to send to the node.
- The HoWhiteList MO must have been configured with the SPID values that are to be allowed access.

# 3 Feature Operation of Subscriber Triggered Mobility

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature acts on SPID values, but the actions the

eNodeB can trigger are different from each other and they are activated separately. The feature

consists of the RFPM and the ORC parts.

RAT and Frequency Priority Modification

RFPM handles the modification of RAT frequency priority.

For RFPM, the locally defined configuration is performed in the

RATFreqPrio MO. The RATFreqPrio MO is configured

with frequencies, corresponding priorities,

subpriorities in case of NR frequencies, and a

list of SPID values that are associated with this configuration. The same SPID value can

only be included in one of the RATFreqPrio MOs.

For a UE that is not associated with a SPID value or its SPID value is not included in any

of the RATFreqPrio MO instances, the default priorities are used, as

defined in the following MOs:

- EUtranFreqRelation
- GeranFreqGroupRelation
- UtranFreqRelation
- Cdma2000FreqBandRelation
- Cdma20001xRttBandRelation
- GUtranFreqRelation

Further, the node compares the configuration in RATFreqPrio MO with its

current frequency relations to sort out which frequencies can be used.

Operator Reserved Cell

ORC handles the blocking of incoming handovers. The node must be configured and have the

licenses required to perform incoming handovers. The cell must be configured to be in the

"reserved for operator use" mode.

For ORC, the locally defined configuration is performed in the

HoWhiteList MO. The configuration includes a list of SPID values that

are allowed to perform incoming handover if the cell is in the "reserved for operator use"

mode.

## 3.1 RAT and Frequency Priority Modification Operation

RRC Connected Mode RAT and Frequency Priority Modification

If the UE has a SPID value associated with it, the eNodeB adds additional criteria for

coverage-triggered session continuity, to select the set of frequencies-LTE or IRAT-where

the UE can be transferred when it encounters poor coverage in the current cell. Each

frequency found in the RATFreqPrio MO that corresponds to the SPID value

is matched towards the list of frequencies found in the following MOs:

- EUtranFreqRelation
- GeranFreqGroupRelation
- UtranFreqRelation
- Cdma2000FreqBandRelation
- Cdma20001xRttBandRelation
- GUtranFreqRelation

Only frequencies that exist in both lists are allowed, the rest are not used. For the

selected frequencies, the priorities found in the RATFreqPrio MO are used

for the remaining sequence of coverage-triggered session continuity.

If no frequencies are found, the SPID value associated with the UE is ignored and the

frequencies and priorities found in the following MOs are used instead:

- EUtranFreqRelation
- GeranFreqGroupRelation
- UtranFreqRelation
- Cdma2000FreqBandRelation
- Cdma20001xRttBandRelation
- GUtranFreqRelation

If this happens, the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_SPID\_PRIORITY\_IGNORED PM Event

is sent.

RRC Idle Mode RAT and Frequency Priority Modification

When a UE transits from RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_IDLE mode,

the RFPM checks if the frequencies and priorities for this UE differ from the ones sent out

in system information. If they differ, the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE

message from the eNodeB to the UE includes a list of dedicated cell reselection priorities

(as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331). These dedicated priorities override the

priorities broadcast in the system information. The dedicated priorities are valid for a

period of time determined by MO attribute RATFreqPrio.t320. During this

RATFreqPrio.t320 period of time, the dedicated cell reselection

priority is used by the UE to determine on which RAT and frequency it to camp while in

RRC\_IDLE mode. More information about when the dedicated priorities are

used and when they are valid can be found in 3GPP TS 36.304, chapter "Cell

Reselection evaluation process".

In case of E-UTRAN, the maximum number of frequencies is eight if UE is compliant with 3GPP

release less than 12. If UE is compliant with release 12 or above, the maximum number of

frequencies is 15.

If the solution Preferential Traffic Management is enabled and the appropriate

configuration is set, the following applies:

Idle mode prioritization can be inhibited between some

cells-to priority cells with very high traffic load from non-priority cells. This

ensures that priority cells are not overloaded, so priority UEs have access in very high

load traffic situations.

For more information, see Preferential Traffic Management Guidelines.

Configuring cell reselection subpriorities for each NR frequency

for a given SPID extends the possible level of NR frequency prioritization. The cell

reselection subpriorities can be configured through the

FreqPrioNR.cellReselectionSubPrio attribute.

Excluding Target Frequencies for Load Balancing and Offloading

The possibility to exclude target frequencies for load balancing and offloading through the

use of SPID is available for the following features:

- Admission-Triggered Offload
- Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload
- Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

### 3.1.1 Frequency Priority Differentiation on Cell Level

SPID-based frequency relation differentiation of UE in the cell for connected and

idle mode mobility.

The rules for cell-level frequency relation differentiation are applicable if the RFPM

function is operable. In this case, parameters from the FreqPrioEUTRA

MO structure can be overridden on the cell level.

Cell-Level Priority Parameter Differentiation in Idle Mode

The following configuration is used if the idle mode mobility frequency list is built

and the SPID is only defined in the UeProfileFilter MO

instance:

- The UeProfileFilter.ueCapPrioAllowed attribute must be used by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature for the priority decisions made by the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature.
- Each frequency relation containing the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef or the GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a value must be checked for a matching SPID.
- The EUtraFreqRelProfile.cellReselectionPriority or the GUtraFreqRelProfile.cellReselectionPrio attribute must be used for a matching SPID, otherwise the frequency is excluded from the list.

The following configuration is used if the idle mode mobility frequency list is built

and SPID is defined in both the UeProfileFilter and the

RATFreqPrio MO instances:

- The UeProfileFilter.ueCapPrioAllowed attribute must be used by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature for the priority decisions made by the Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control feature.
- Each frequency relation containing the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef or the GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a value must be checked for a matching SPID.
- A frequency list must be built with the following rules: Frequencies defined only in the UeProfile MO instance must be included. Frequencies defined in both the RATFreqPrio and the UeProfile MO instances must be included with priority from the UeProfile MO instance. Frequencies defined in the RATFreqPrio MO instance from RATs other than LTE or NR must be included. Other frequencies must be excluded.

If the frequency list contains duplicate priority values between different RATs at

cell reselection, the frequency list is cleared and is not sent in

the RRCConnectionRelease message.

The following configurations are used when the idle mode mobility frequency list is

built and the SPID is defined in both the UeProfileFilter and

RATFreqPrio MO instances, but no frequency is matched with

the UeProfile MO instance:

- The frequency list must be rebuilt using the RATFreqPrio MO instance only.
- Legacy handling must be used once the frequency list is rebuilt.

If the SPID is not included in the UeProfileFilter MO instance,

legacy handling is used.

It is possible to configure cell reselection subpriorities

for each NR frequency relation

profile

on the SPID

level

through the GUtraFreqRelProfile.cellReselectionSubPrio

attribute.

Cell-Level Priority Parameter Differentiation in Connected Mode

The following attributes used at LTE and NR handover can be used for configuring

connected mode mobility:

- EUtraFreqRelProfile.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.voicePrio
- EUtraFreqRelProfile.arpPrio
- GUtraFreqRelProfile.connModeMobilityPrio
- GUtraFreqRelProfile.voicePrio

The following configuration is used if the connected mode mobility frequency list is

built and the SPID is only defined in the UeProfileFilter MO

instance:

- Each frequency relation containing the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef or the GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a value must be checked for a matching SPID.
- Priority parameters from the EUtraFreqRelProfile or the GUtraFreqRelProfile MO class must be used for a matching SPID, otherwise the frequency is excluded from the list.

The following configuration is used if the connected mode mobility frequency list is

built and the SPID is defined in both the UeProfileFilter and the

RATFreqPrio MO instances:

- Each frequency relation containing the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef or the GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a value must be checked for a matching SPID.
- A frequency list must be built with the following rules: Frequencies defined only in the UeProfile MO instance must be included. Frequencies defined in both the RATFreqPrio and the UeProfile MO instances must be included with priority from the UeProfile MO instance. Other frequencies must be excluded.

The following configuration is used if the connected mode mobility frequency list is

built and the SPID is defined in both the UeProfileFilter and the

RATFreqPrio MO instances, but no frequency is matched with

the UeProfile MO instance:

- The frequency list must be rebuilt using the RATFreqPrio MO instance only.
- Legacy handling must be used once the frequency list is rebuilt.

If SPID is not included in the UeProfileFilter MO instance, legacy

handling is used.

If priority for single frequency relation is checked and the frequency relation

contains the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef or the

GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a

value matching the SPID, the corresponding parameter from the

EUtraFreqRelProfile or the

GUtraFreqRelProfile MO class must be used respectively.

If the SPID is not included in the UeProfileFilter MO instance,

legacy handling is used.

Additional Rules for Load Balancing

The following configurations are possible depending on the setting of the

EUtraFreqRelProfile.loadBalancingAllowed attribute when SPIDs

are matched:

- If the attribute is set to KEEP\_OTHER\_CONFIGURATION, the configuration from the RATFreqPrio MO instance is used.
- If the attribute is set to LB\_AND\_OFFLOAD\_ALLOWED, frequency is allowed.
- If the attribute is set to NOT\_ALLOWED, frequency is not allowed.

The following configuration is used if the frequency list is filtered for load

balancing and the SPID is only defined in the UeProfileFilter MO

instance:

- Each frequency relation containing the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a value must be checked for a matching SPID.
- If the EUtraFreqRelProfile MO instance is matched, the loadBalancingAllowed parameter shows whether the frequency is allowed or not.

The following configuration is used if the frequency list is filtered for load

balancing and the SPID is defined in both the UeProfileFilter and

the RATFreqPrio MO instances:

- Each frequency relation containing the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute with a value must be checked for a matching SPID.
- The frequency list must be filtered with the following rules: Only the frequency defined in the UeProfile MO instance must use the EUtraFreqRelProfile.loadBalancingAllowed attribute to determine whether frequency is allowed or not. Frequencies defined in both the RATFreqPrio and the UeProfile MO instances must use the EUtraFreqRelProfile.loadBalancingAllowed attribute to determine whether frequency is allowed or not. Other frequencies are allowed.

The following configuration is used if SPID is defined in both the

UeProfileFilter and the RATFreqPrio MO

instances, but no frequency is matched with the UeProfile MO

instance:

- The frequency list must be refiltered using the RATFreqPrio MO instance only. Frequencies not included in the RATFreqPrio MO instance are allowed.
- Frequencies included in the RATFreqPrio MO instance but not in frequency relation are excluded.

The following configuration is used when SPID is defined only in the

RATFreqPrio MO instance:

- The loadBalancingAllowed parameter in the RATFreqPrio MO class must be used to determine whether frequency is allowed or not. Frequencies not included in the RATFreqPrio MO instance are allowed.
- Frequencies included in the RATFreqPrio MO instance but not in frequency relation are excluded.

If SPID is not used or there is no SPID value for the UE, then no frequency is

blocked by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature.

Fallback to RATFreqPrio MO class

Each UeProfile priority parameter can be set to a value of

-1000. When this value is used, priority is selected from the

corresponding parameter in the RATFreqPrio MO class. If the

RATFreqPrio MO instance is not configured, then the value is

selected from the frequency relation.

### 3.1.2 EN-DC Frequency Priority Differentiation on Cell Level

Frequency relations can be prioritized in the cell for EN-DC-connected UEs based on

the SPID that is associated with the UE.

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature prioritizes UEs with associated SPIDs based on

the configuration of either the UeProfile or the

RATFreqPrio MO instance during frequency list evaluation.

The frequency is defined in the UeProfile MO instance if the following

conditions are met:

- The UE SPID matches the associated SPID defined by the UeProfileFilter.spidList attribute.
- The frequency relation contains the EUtranFreqRelation.eUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute that refers to the EUtraFreqRelProfileSet MO or the GUtranFreqRelation.gUtraFreqRelProfileSetRef attribute that refers to the GUtraFreqRelProfileSet MO.

The frequency is defined in the RATFreqPrio MO instance if the

following conditions are met:

- The UE SPID matches the associated SPID defined by the RATFreqPrio.spidList attribute.
- The corresponding FreqPrioEUtra or FreqPrioNR MO is associated with an LTE or NR frequency.

If the frequency is not defined in the UeProfile or the

RATFreqPrio MO instances, the value of the

EUtranFreqRelation.endcHoFreqPriority or the

GUtranFreqRelation.endcB1MeasPriority attribute is used to define

the priority level.

A frequency list must be created with the following rules:

- If frequencies are defined only in the UeProfile MO instance, the frequencies are included with the associated priority values defined by the EUtraFreqRelProfile.endcHoFreqPriority or the GUtraFreqRelProfile.endcB1MeasPriority attribute.
- If frequencies are defined in both the UeProfile and the RATFreqPrio MO instances, the frequencies are included with the associated priority values, which are defined by the EUtraFreqRelProfile.endcHoFreqPriority or the GUtraFreqRelProfile.endcB1MeasPriority attribute.
- If frequencies are defined only in the RATFreqPrio MO instance and UeProfile MO configuration is not available for any frequencies, the frequencies are included with the associated priority values, which are defined by the FreqPrioNR.endcB1MeasPriority or the FreqPrioEUtra.endcHoFreqPriority attribute.
- If frequencies are defined only in the RATFreqPrio MO instance and the UeProfile MO is configured for any of the frequencies, the frequencies are included with the associated priority values, which are defined by the EUtranFreqRelation.endcHoFreqPriority or the GUtranFreqRelation.endcB1MeasPriority attribute.
- If frequencies are not defined in the UeProfile or in the RATFreqPrio MO instances, the frequencies are included with the associated priority values, which are defined by the EUtranFreqRelation.endcHoFreqPriority or the GUtranFreqRelation.endcB1MeasPriority attribute.

### 3.1.3 Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users

Selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility

feature if the subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the

configurable threshold.

If the LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users feature is

activated, a subscription ratio threshold can be defined for the serving cell. If the

subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the defined threshold,

the selected high-priority UEs are handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature.

If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the defined threshold, the

selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the following features, if they are

activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

The high-priority UEs can be selected using the following attributes:

- RATFreqPrio.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl
- UeProfileFilter.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl

The subscription ratio threshold can be defined using one of the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr
- EUtranCellTDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr

For more information, see LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for

High-Priority Users.

## 3.2 Operator Reserved Cell Operation

ORC Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   SPID Decision Diagram at Incoming Handover

Process Steps

1. For an incoming handover, it is checked if the ORC function of Subscriber Triggered Mobility is OPERABLE to see if ORC is activated. If not, the handover is allowed to continue the preparation.
2. The cell is in mode "reserved for operator use" if serving PLMN ID of UE is configured as "reserved for operator use". Serving PLMN is derived from Handover Restriction List in the handover preparation message. If the cell is not in "reserved for operator use" mode, handover is allowed to continue the preparation. Note: In case of Shared LTE RAN configuration, ORC evaluates EUtranCellFDD.primaryPlmnReserved and EUtranCellFDD.additionalPlmnReservedList, or EUtranCellTDD.primaryPlmnReserved and EUtranCellTDD.additionalPlmnReservedList for the UEs serving PLMN.
3. If the SPID of the UE is included in the handover preparation message and matches any of the SPIDs in HoWhiteList.spidList, handover is allowed to continue preparation. The UE is rejected and a handover preparation failure message is sent back to the source cell in the following circumstances:
    - The SPID in the handover preparation message does not match any of the SPIDs in HoWhiteList.spidList.
    - There is no SPID in the handover preparation message.
    - No HoWhiteList.spidList is configured.

## 3.3 Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency Priority

The SPID parameter received by the node through the S1 interface is an index referring to

user information for mobility profile and service use profile. The information is

UE-specific and applies to all its radio bearers. This index is mapped by the node to

locally defined configuration to apply specific RRM strategies. The strategies include

defining RRC\_IDLE mode priorities and control IRAT,

intra-frequency, or inter-frequency handover in RRC\_CONNECTED

mode.

# 4 Network Impact of Subscriber Triggered Mobility

The feature has no impact on the physical cell coverage but specific UEs experience

higher probability for good coverage than others.

Coverage and Mobility

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature has no impact on the physical cell

coverage. However RFPM-that allows different priorities for frequencies for each

subscription-can result in that some subscriptions experience a higher probability

for better coverage than others (depending on whether the target frequency has a

good cell coverage).

The RFPM part of the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature introduces

subscription-based priorities that affect both RRC\_IDLE mode

priorities and control IRAT and inter-frequency handover in

RRC\_CONNECTED mode. These priorities are used to determine

where the UE camps while in RRC\_IDLE mode and which target

frequency is used when mobility actions in RRC\_CONNECTED mode

are required.

The ORC part of the feature introduces blocking of incoming handovers to a cell in

"reserved for operator use" and for UEs that do not belong to a SPID value that is

allowed.

When the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is deactivated, the SPID is ignored by

the node, but stored and forwarded at handover.

Interfaces

The SPID parameter is received by the node through the S1 interface.

Other Network Elements

UEs are determined by their SPID if they have access to certain cells and

frequencies, or if they are affected by certain priorities.

# 5 Parameters for Subscriber Triggered Mobility

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Subscriber Triggered Mobility

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature can be used to selectively control access

to part of the RAN, for example to restrict certain frequencies.

With this feature, the network or the eNodeB can identify specific UEs using SPID, so it

is possible to steer the UE in idle to not select a certain band, or in connected mode

to restrict mobility to a certain band.

When the UE goes from connected mode to idle mode, the eNodeB sends out a new frequency

and band priority list to the UE in the RRC Connection Release message, based on the

Subscriber Profile ID configuration. This priority list can be used for excluding a

specific frequency or band by setting the specific prio (voicePrio or

connectedModeMobilityPrio) as -1. The priorities are used to determine which frequencies

or bands are measured by the UE before the redirect or handover target is selected.

The members of the following attributes override the corresponding attributes in the

respective frequencies:

- RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA
- RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListUTRA
- RATFreqPrio.freqGroupPrioListGERAN
- RATFreqPrio.bandClassPrioListCDMA2000
- RATFreqPrio.bandClassPrioListCDMA1xRtt

For example, the connectedModeMobilityPrio member of the

RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA attribute overrides the

EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute.

Table 3 is an example configuration to

restrict certain frequency bands to be used as Primary Cell. Carrier Aggregation for

Secondary Cell is still possible if the UE supports the band combination in downlink. If

Carrier Aggregation band combination with restricted frequency is not reported in UE

Capability, Carrier Aggregation is not configured either.

These parameters are configured in the dedicated SubscriberProfileID

for the specific RATFreqPrio.

RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA attribute.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q1: Preferential Traffic Management

The Preferential Traffic Management solution enables the operator to control user access

to priority and non-priority bands. With Preferential Traffic Management, it is possible to

define up to 12 subscriber groups denoted by a list of SPIDs and PLMN with different

selection priority for Inter-Frequency Offload and Admission-Triggered Offload.

| Feature Identity:       | 20/FAJ 121 1447                         |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                        |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                     |

The Preferential Traffic Management solution offers the operator the possibility to efficiently

use an LTE network, deployed on several frequency bands, with one frequency band used

primarily for priority users. The solution enables the following:

- To use the priority band for both priority and non-priority users as long as co-existence rules allow it.
- To use the priority band exclusively for priority users in the intended traffic situations.
- To use the non-priority bands for both non-priority and priority users, both as coverage bands and bands to offload priority traffic when the priority band is overloaded.
- To define how Preferential Traffic Management functions treat specific UEs by using subscriber groups.

The load management policies used depend on the current traffic load level. Traffic load

states in the solution are defined by configurable load threshold parameters.

The solution is developed for existing commercial RAN infrastructure with a designated

band used as priority band, using an MOCN architecture. The solution is achieved by a

collection of extensions in existing licensed features, configured to work together.

For more detailed information on Preferential Traffic Management, see Preferential Traffic Management

Guidelines.

Capacity and Performance

The capacity on priority bands is limited for non-priority users and changes with network

congestion level. This is because of the need to provide uninterrupted connectivity

for priority users. During network congestion, an increased drop in mobility success

rate towards priority cells is expected.

Operation

The Preferential Traffic Management solution is activated on node level using the

PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute.

On the eNodeB, a maximum of four cell profiles can be configured, but a cell refers

to only one predefined profile. This controls which Preferential Traffic Management

actions are triggered on the cell. Each cell profile can be configured using the

PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute with the following

settings:

- PRIORITY
- NON\_PRIORITY

UE selection for Admission-Triggered Offload and Inter-Frequency Offload works only

if the PtmCellProfile.cellType attribute is set to

PRIORITY.

The function introduces the following new MO classes:

- PtmAtoConfig
- PtmCellProfile
- PtmFunction
- PtmIflbConfig
- PtmIfoConfig
- PtmResOpUseConfig
- PtmStmConfig
- PtmSubscriberGroup

This function is controlled by the following new parameters:

- PtmAtoConfig.minSuccRateThreshold
- PtmAtoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmCellProfile.cellType
- PtmFunction.ptmEnabled
- PtmIflbConfig.stopIncomingIflbThreshold
- PtmIflbConfig.stopOutgoingIflbEnabled
- PtmIfoConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.resSRatioThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresMsrUsageThreshold
- PtmResOpUseConfig.unresSRatioThreshold
- PtmStmConfig.inhibitImpInterval
- PtmStmConfig.ptmSubscriberGroupRef
- PtmSubscriberGroup.plmn
- PtmSubscriberGroup.spidList

Handover of UEs with certain PLMN IDs and SPID to a

target cell can be blocked. This occurs when the PLMN ID of the UE is "reserved for

operator use" in the target cell. It can be reserved, because the priority cell has

a very high traffic load-subscription ratio or MSR usage. It is also required that

the SPID of the UE is configured in the PtmSubscriberGroup MO as

the PtmStmConfig MO refers to that group.

The following features are affected by the solution:

Summary and Benefits

This system improvement enhances accessibility for priority UEs as part of the

Preferential Traffic Management solution. It enables priority UEs that utilize

non-priority equivalent home PLMN to connect to priority bands and to fully utilize

priority cell resources under the following circumstances:

- The priority cells are in a high traffic load.
- The priority PLMN core network is not available due to S1-C connection failure.

Capacity and Performance

This system improvement can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPtmCellReservedMsr
