# 1 Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation Overview

The Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation feature removes the need for manually

allocating a spread of EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence and

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence

attributes. This reduces the overlap of root sequences.

| Feature Name           | Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 2026                                           |
| Value Package Name     | Self-Organizing Networks                               |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0435                                           |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                    |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                    |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license for each node. |

Depending on the quality of the manual RACH root sequence allocation, automated allocation

might help reduce false preamble detection, which improves UE accessibility.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

Affected System Function

Changing the RACH root sequence index with

EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence can cause incoming handover to

fail for a short period (~5 seconds). Incoming handovers have a higher probability

to fail until the new RACH root sequence index is updated in SIB, and used in uplink

for preamble detection.

# 3 Feature Operation of Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation

The purpose of the Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation feature is to reduce root

sequence overlap between neighbor cells, compared to the default root sequence index allocation

strategy.

If a planned root sequence index allocation strategy exists, use of the feature does not

guarantee an improvement since root sequences are allocated in a heuristic way.

The feature does not detect or avoid all overlapping root sequence indexes between neighbor

cells in the network. The probability for root sequence index overlap between neighbor cells

depends on the amount of neighbor relations and cell range.

Figure 2   Example of Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation

The Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation operates the following way:

1. The operator activates the feature.
2. The eNodeB changes parameter EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence, and the new EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence or EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence is broadcast in SIB2.

# 4 Network Impact of Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation

The implementation of the Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation feature has no impact

on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation

The Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation feature affects the

EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence and

EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence parameters.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                                                      | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.rachRootSequence  EUtranCellTDD.rachRootSequence | Affected | First root sequence number for RACH preamble generation.  RACH root sequence is broadcast as a part of system information distribution and is                 used for preamble detection. For information on the definition of logical root                 sequence number, see 3GPP TS 36.211.  Taking effect depends on the feature state. |

# 6 Performance of Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation

The Automated RACH Root Sequence Allocation feature improves the Initial E-RAB

Establishment Success Rate and the Handover Success Rate KPIs. The feature has associated

counters, that allow observability of the feature operation.

KPIs

|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initial E-RAB Establishment Success Rate | Indicates the performance of the establishment of LTE radio bearers. The bearer establishment process commences with the CBRA process. |
| Handover Success Rate                    | Indicates the performance of the inter-cell handover.                                                                                  |
