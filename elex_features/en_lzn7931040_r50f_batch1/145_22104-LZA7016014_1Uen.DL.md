# 1 Multiple Frequency Band Indicators Overview

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature simplifies the frequency band

compatibility for the operators and UE vendors. The feature enables the cells to accommodate

UEs that support the physical frequency but not the primary band of the cell.

| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                                           |

Summary

Several LTE bands have overlapping frequency ranges. However the configured center frequency

(EARFCN) of an LTE cell is always associated with a single band, even when the

bandwidth of the cell makes it included in other bands as well. This feature allows

the eNodeB to use the overlapping bands when the UE does not support the configured

EARFCN of the cell. The eNodeB broadcasts the valid overlapping bands for the cell

in system information, and is able to handle a connecting UE which only supports one

of the overlapping bands. When the UE does not support the band of a frequency

relation, the eNodeB is able to configure measurements in the UE using an

alternative EARFCN on an overlapping band. Also, the mobility features of the eNodeB

are able to direct the UE to new target cells and frequencies, using overlapping

bands, which is otherwise not be supported by the UE.

The

Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature provides the following

benefits:

- Simplifying frequency band compatibility for operators and UE vendors.
- Enabling the cell to accommodate UEs that support the physical frequency but not the primary band of the cell.
- Making efficient use of license spectrum by allowing harmonized 3GPP bands and legacy band in the same cell.
- Increasing the number of UEs which are compatible with the network, including roaming UEs.

Additional Information

Additional information about this feature and related topics can be found in the

following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 36.101: User Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception
- 3GPP TS 36.331: Radio Resource Control (RRC)
- 3GPP TS 36.413: S1 Application Protocol (S1AP)
- 3GPP TS 36.423: X2 Application Protocol (X2AP)

# 2 Dependencies of Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

All eNodeB features which use measurements on other frequencies, and all features

which can do release with redirect or handover are affected by this feature.

Features

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

(1)  source eNodeB, target eNodeB, and UE

support Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature has limitations when used together with the

A-MPR CBRS functionality.

Network Requirements

To fully

benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following network

elements:

- The eNodeB assumes that any physical frequency used in the network is always represented by the same EARFCN. That is, if a cell C1 is configured with EARFCN N (representing frequency f on band B2) and another cell C2 uses the same frequency f, it must also be configured with the same EARFCN N. It cannot be configured with another EARFCN N2 on an overlapping band B2, even if N2 represents the same physical frequency f. Example of configuration that does not fulfill the requirement is: Cells A and B use downlink frequency 880 MHz for FDD, or 1910 MHz for TDD, as center frequency Cell A uses EARFCN 8900 for FDD, or 36100 for TDD (band 26) Cell B uses EARFCN 6050 for FDD, or 38550 for TDD (band 19)

# 3 Feature Operation of Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature allows the UE to support more

frequencies.

The frequency ranges of several LTE bands overlap. For more information on all the LTE bands,

see 3GPP TS 36.101. A cell on a band might be covered by an overlapping band.

Figure 1 shows an example where Cell E is on

Band 17 but also covered by Band 12.

Figure 1   Cell E Supporting Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is not operable, then the following are

true for a UE which does not support the B17 band:

- The UE cannot connect to the cell even if the UE supports overlapping band.
- A UE which is connected to another cell cannot be configured to do a measurement on B17 to find the cell, even if the UE supports the overlapping band.
- A UE which is connected to another cell cannot be released with redirect to B17 (eventually to find and connect to the cell) even if the UE supports the overlapping band. Handover to the cell is not possible.

When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, and the UE supports the

feature, then all the previous is possible. The UE indicates that it supports the feature by

setting bit 31 of the Feature Group Indicators, see 3GPP TS 36.331.

When the feature is activated, the behavior of the eNodeB changes as follows:

- System Information: System Information Block Type Description SIB1 The eNodeB broadcasts in SIB1 information about what additional bands are overlapping with the cell. This enables a UE in idle mode to determine that it can connect to the cell even when it only supports one of the overlapping bands. When the High Power UE feature is used, the eNodeB also broadcasts in SIB1 information what maximum output power and network signaling values are supported on each additional frequency band. The priority of the bands can be changed using the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement. SIB2 The eNodeB broadcasts in SIB2 information about spectrum emission requirements associated with each overlapping band included in SIB1. SIB5 The eNodeB broadcasts in SIB5 information about what possible overlapping bands can be used by a UE in idle mode when connecting to other LTE frequencies. SIB15 The eNodeB broadcasts in SIB15 information overlapping bands that can be used by a UE when determining if it can go to a specific band to receive MBMS services. It is also used by a connected UE to determine if it can send a MBMSInterestIndication for a specific band.
- When a UE connects to a cell, the eNodeB discovers that the UE requires the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature and that it uses an alternative EARFCN on an overlapping band for the serving frequency.
- When required, the eNodeB can configure a measurement in a UE to use an alternative EARFCN on an extra band, both when measuring on the serving frequency and on other LTE frequencies.
- At handover and release with redirect, an EARFCN on an extra band can be used for UEs which require this.
- Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band is an enhancement to the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature.
- Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 is an enhancement to the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature.

When this feature is operable, the node includes information elements in system

information blocks that are required to support additional bands.

Additional Frequency Bands for LTE Frequencies

## 3.2 Primary and Additional Frequency Bands in the MOM

The eNodeB automatically configures the primary and additional frequency bands, even

when the feature is not operable.

The primary and additional frequency bands are automatically configured by the eNodeB, even

if the feature is not operable.

The priority of additional bands can be manually configured but none of the bands can be

excluded.

### 3.2.1 The Primary Frequency Band

For several cell and frequency MO classes, the freqBand attribute

automatically contains the primary frequency band used.

The freqBand attribute is automatically set to contain the primary

frequency band used by the following cell and frequency MO classes:

- EUtranCellFDD
- EUtranFrequency
- EUtranCellTDD
- ExternalEUtranCellFDD
- ExternalEUtranCellTDD
- NbIotCell Note: The freqBand attribute is applicable to all NB-IoT deployments, if the feature is enabled.

The eNodeB derives this from the EARFCN of the corresponding MO using the mapping from the

EARFCN to the frequency band. For more information on E-UTRA channel numbers, see 3GPP

TS 36.101.

### 3.2.2 Additional Frequency Bands for Cells

The set of bands which overlaps with a cell is automatically configured in the cell MO and

operator can only manually configure the priority of these bands. The mechanism is slightly

different for internal and external cells.

#### 3.2.2.1 Additional Frequency Band List for EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD

The EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or the

EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute contains a list of all bands

that covers the cell completely. The operator is able to prioritize additional bands over

primary band and also use its own priorities of additional bands with Frequency Band Indicator

Priority Rel-12 Enhancement.

The EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or the

EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute contains a list of all

bands covering the cell completely, considering the bandwidth of the cell and also the

information on the E-UTRA channel bandwidth in the 3GPP TS 36.101.

3GPP TS 36.101 defines which cell bandwidths are supported for each band. A band

is only included in the additionalFreqBandList if it supports the

bandwidth of the cell.

CBRS

cells use band 48 as the primary band. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

feature is enabled on the eNodeB that contains a CBRS cell, the following bands cannot

be used as additional bands for band 48:

- 42
- 43
- 49

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.307 version 16.3.0 Release 16.

Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Enhancement for Multiple Frequency Band

Indicators

The operator is able to prioritize additional bands over the primary band and also use its

own priorities of additional bands with the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

enhancement by setting the following:

- The EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attributes must be set to true.
- The EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList.

The list of additional bands broadcasted in SIB1 contains the following bands:

- If the mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is set to false in this cell, then it contains bands from the additionalFreqBandList from this cell.
- If the mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is set to true in this cell, then it contains bands from the prioAdditionalFreqBandList and the additionalFreqBandList from this cell, if not all were specified in the prioAdditionalFreqBandList.

The SIB2 always contains list of bands from the additionalFreqBandList

from this cell.

The Additional Frequency Band List is sent to the neighbor eNodeBs in the X2 SETUP

REQUEST, the X2 SETUP RESPONSE, and the ENB CONFIGURATION

UPDATE messages is following:

- If the mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is set to false in the cell or the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to false, then it contains bands from the additionalFreqBandList from this cell.
- If the mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is set to true in this cell and the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to true, then it contains bands from the prioAdditionalFreqBandList complemented with bands from the additionalFreqBandList from this cell, if not all were specified in the prioAdditionalFreqBandList.

If the Additional Frequency Band List is modified because of attribute changes, then the

following messages are updated and sent immediately without requiring to lock and unlock the

cell.

- SIB1
- SIB2
- X2AP

#### 3.2.2.2 Additional Frequency Band List for ExternalEUtranCellFDD and ExternalEUtranCellTDD

A list containing all the bands that cover the cell completely is used during the X2

Handover procedures. The list can be obtained from the

ExternalEUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList or the

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attributes.

The ExternalEUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList or the

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute contains a list of

all bands that cover the cell completely. This list is used during the X2 Handover

procedures.

The following cases are considered when the eNodeB builds the list:

- The ExternalEUtranCellFDD or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO is created by the ANR or by the operator, and there is no X2 connection for this cell. In these cases, the value of the dlChannelBandwidth attribute is 0. Note: The Automated Neighbor Relations feature sets the dlChannelBandwidth attribute to 0 and since it is read-only, it cannot be set by the operator. This means that the bandwidth of the cell is unknown, and the attribute is determined by the eNodeB using the attributes from the EUtranFrequency MO. These attributes correspond to the values set by the operator in the neighboring eNodeBs, in the following ways: If the value of the EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute is set to false, or if the value of the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to false then the additional Frequency Band List is determined by the eNodeB using the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList but without bands listed in EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList. If the EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute is set to true and the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to true then the additional Frequency Band List is determined by the eNodeB using the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList and bands from the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList, but without bands listed in EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList.
- The ExternalEUtranCellFDD or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO is created when an X2 connection is established. In this case, the additionalFreqBandList attribute is set according to the list received from the neighbor eNodeB in the X2AP messages. For more information, see X2 Configuration.

The additionalFreqBandList attribute is updated when any of the

following events are triggered:

- The ExternalEUtranCellFDD or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO was initially created by the Automated Neighbor Relations or the operator, but is later defined by X2. The list determined by the eNodeB is replaced by the MultibandInfoList received in the X2 SETUP REQUEST or the X2 SETUP RESPONSE messages.
- The ExternalEUtranCellFDD or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO is created by the Automated Neighbor Relations feature or the operator, and the EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList attribute is updated. In this case, the list is recalculated.
- An X2:ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message arrives, which includes a new or updated MultibandInfoList. In this case, the value of the attribute is replaced by the new list.
- The frequency of the ExternalEUtranCellFDD or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO is modified, using the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency MO action for FDD or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency MO action for TDD. In this case, the list is recalculated from the new frequency using the lists in the new EUtranFrequency MO. If the EUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency or the EUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency MO action is performed, and a different additional band is chosen than what the additionalFreqBandList attribute contains, then the value of the prioAdditionalFreqBandList is set to empty.

The SIB5 contains additional bands defined in the

EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList attribute, excluding the bands

defined in the EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList attribute.

##### 3.2.2.2.1 Creating additionalFreqBandList with Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor Support on X2 Enhancement

The Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2 enhancement

makes it possible to treat the additionalFreqBandList attribute as

prioritized.

In case an X2 message is received with the information that the

freqBandIndicatorPriority MOC is set to broadcast, the received

multiBandInfoList attribute is treated as prioritized.

When an ExternalEUtranCellTDD or

ExternalEUtrancellFDD MO is created by the Automated Neighbor Relations feature or an

operator, then the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2

enhancement allows the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList

or the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute to be

changed by keeping band prioritization.

If the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList has fewer bands than

the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList attribute, then the

EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqbandList attribute is used in

the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.addtionalFreqBandList or the

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.addtionalFreqBandList. The remaining bands

from EutranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList are added at the end of

the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.addtionalFreqBandList or the

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.addtionalFreqBandList.

The EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList or the

EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute is created using

data from the EUtranFrequency MO under the following conditions:

- All frequency bands from the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList in the order they are listed in the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList, when it does not contain any other frequency bands.
- If the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList has fewer bands than the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList, then the remaining bands from the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList are included at the end of the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.addtionalFreqBandList or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.addtionalFreqBandList, after the ones prioritized by the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList.
- If the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList cannot be used, then the bands in the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList are used in the order they are included in the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList.

The EutranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList can be used when the

following conditions are fulfilled:

- The bands listed in the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList are part of the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList too. Note: The prioritized list does not need to contain all bands from the EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList.
- The EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList cannot contain bands listed in the EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList.
- The value of the EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute must be set to true.
- The neighboring eNodeB supports the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 support on X2 enhancement.

### 3.2.3 Additional Frequency Bands for LTE Frequencies

All bands covering the frequency are presented in the

EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList attribute.

The EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList attribute contains all bands

which cover the frequency, including the possible cell bandwidths according to the E-UTRA

channel bandwidth specifications mentioned in 3GPP TS 36.101.

The band B is included in the

EUtranFrequency.additionalFreqBandList attribute representing an EARFCN

on frequency f in the following cases:

- The frequency f is included in the frequency range of B
- A hypothetical cell using the smallest cell bandwidth allowed both on the primary band of the frequency MO by the freqBand attribute, and on B, is covered by both B and the primary band. For more information, see the E-UTRA channel bandwidth specifications in 3GPP TS 36.101.

### 3.2.4 Multiple Frequency Band Indicators Used for NB-IoT Cells

The feature enables MFBI-capable NB-IoT UEs to operate in a cell, when a UE supports

at least one frequency band of the cell.

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature

enables NB-IoT UEs that support the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators to

operate in a cell when a UE supports at least one of the frequency bands of

the cell. These bands include the primary band and any additional bands. The

primary band is the frequency band in which the EARFCN of the cell is

included. Additional bands are frequency bands, including the physical

frequency, taking the cell bandwidth into account.

The primary and additional bands are calculated and set by the node automatically for

SIB1-NB and SIB2-NB.

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators support can be enabled for all NB-IoT deployment

modes by setting the NbIotCell.enableMfbi attribute to

true.

If the feature is enabled, the node broadcasts the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

information, as shown in Table 3.

Table 3   System Information Broadcast for Multiple Frequency Band Indicators for

NB-IoT

| Message   | Broadcast Information                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SIB1-NB   | Contains the additional frequency bands that can be used when                                 accessing the cell.                       |
| SIB2-NB   | Contains the spectrum emission values for additional frequency                                 bands.                                   |
| SIB5-NB   | The additional frequency bands must be configured by setting the                                     NbIotCell.frequencyInfo attribute. |

### 3.2.5 Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

It is possible to change the priority of bands used by the UE during initial

connection setup or handover by using the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

enhancement of this feature.

The Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement for the Multiple Frequency Band

Indicators feature provides a possibility to change the priority of bands the UE is

using during initial connection setup or handover. This is broadcasted in SIB1, if the

EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the

EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute is set to

true, and sent in the following X2AP messages if the

ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled is set to

true:

- X2 SETUP REQUEST
- X2 SETUP RESPONSE
- eNodeB CONFIGURATION UPDATE

If the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 is broadcast and UE supports it, which is

indicated in the freqBandPriorityAdjustment attribute, then the UE

prioritizes the additional bands over the primary band during connection setup or

handover.

It is possible to disable the use of Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 during X2

handovers when the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is

set to false.

When the mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute is set to

true, then the operator can manually configure the priorities of

the additional bands by using the prioAdditionalFreqBandList

attribute in this cell.

#### 3.2.5.1 Restrictions of Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

Several restrictions must be fulfilled before enabling this enhancement.

Before the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 for X2 Handovers enhancement is

enabled by setting the value of the

EnodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled to true, the

following restrictions must be fulfilled:

- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute must be the same in all cells with the same EARFCN in eNodeBs connected through X2.Note: If not, the X2 handovers might fail between cells with different Frequency Band Indicator Priority values.
- The list of prioritized additional bands defined in the EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList attributes must be the same in all cells with the same EARFCN in all eNodeBs connected through X2 interface.
- All E-UTRAN cells have the same value of the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute as the EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio under corresponding EUtranFrequency in all eNodeBs connected through the X2 interface.
- All E-UTRAN cells for which the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute as EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is set to true have defined the same list in the EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList attributes as the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList under the corresponding EUtranFrequency in all eNodeBs connected through the X2 interface. Note: The EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList attribute could have an affect on the resulting list.

Forbidden configuration of eNodeBs parameters are the following:

- The value of the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled is set to true, and the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is not the same in all cells with the same specific EARFCN.
- The value of the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to true, and the EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList is not the same in all cells with the same specific EARFCN.
- The value of the EUtranFrequency.prioAdditionalFreqBandList attribute is different than the EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList in cells using the same EARFCN in all neighbor eNodeBs.
- The value of the EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute is different from the value of the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio in cells using the same EARFCN in all neighbor eNodeBs.

Forbidden RAN configurations are the following:

- An eNodeB with the value of ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled set to true as neighbor to eNodeB with old software, for example a previous release without this function.
- An eNodeB with the value of ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled set to true as neighbor to other vendor eNodeBs which do not support FBIP over X2.
- The value of the ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to true, and the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio is not the same in all cells in all eNodeB with the same specific EARFCN.
- The ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute is set to true, and the EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList is not the same in all cells in all eNodeBs with the same specific EARFCN.

## 3.3 UE Connects Using Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

The eNodeB checks several conditions to determine if the UE is connected to a cell

using this feature.

The eNodeB determines if a UE has connected to the cell using Multiple Frequency Band

Indicators feature by checking the following conditions:

- The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable.
- The UE has set FGI bit 31 to 1, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331.
- The UE does not support the frequency band of the serving cell, that is, the band in the freqBand attribute does not occur in the supportedBandListEUTRA UE capability information element.
- The UE supports at least one of the additional frequency bands of the serving cell. That is, at least one of the bands in the EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute occurs in the supportedBandListEUTRA UE capability information element. In this case, the eNodeB uses the first occurring supported band in the additionalFreqBandList IE for the UE, and the corresponding EARFCN from this band. It is guaranteed to be the same EARFCN the UE picked, and ensures that the security key KeNB* is calculated correctly. For more information, see the description of the SIB1 multiBandInfoList IE in 3GPP TS 36.311.

When the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement is activated on the cell, the

eNodeB determines if a UE has connected to the cell using this feature on prioritized band by

checking the following conditions:

- The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable.
- The Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement is activated on the cell.
- The UE has set FGI bit 31 to 1, as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331.
- The value of the freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 MOC is set to 1.
- The UE supports at least one of the additional frequency bands of the serving cell. In this case, the eNodeB uses the first occurring supported band in the EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or the EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList attribute for the UE, and the corresponding EARFCN from this band. It is guaranteed to be the same EARFCN the UE picked, and ensures that the security key KeNB* is calculated correctly. For more information, see the description of the SIB1 multiBandInfoList IE in 3GPP TS 36.311.

Re-establishment is handled in the same way as initial connection regarding this feature.

## 3.4 Configuring Measurements with Multiple Frequency Band Indicators Support

Several eNodeB features select LTE frequencies as targets for measurements in the UE

based on UE capabilities.

When a UE is connected to the cell using MFBI, an alternative EARFCN is selected for the

serving cell. This EARFCN is used when configuring the measurement object for all measurements

in the UE on the serving

frequency.

Several eNodeB features select LTE frequencies as targets for measurements in the UE, based

on, among many other criteria, the UE capabilities, and in particular the IE

supportedBandListEUTRA attribute. These frequencies are selected from

the available EUtranFreqRelation MOs in the MOM below the serving cell MO.

These EUtranFreqRelation MOs represent frequencies as EARFCNs, and the

eNodeB can only select frequencies supported by the UE. When the feature is not operable, a

frequency relation is supported by the UE only if the frequency band specified in the

EUtranFrequency.freqBand attribute of the corresponding

EUtranFrequency MO is included in the

supportedBandListEUTRA attribute of the UE.

When the feature is operable, additional bands in the

EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList or the

EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attributes are also checked for the

supportedBandListEUTRA attribute of the UE. If additional bands are

found, then the UE supports the frequency using an alternative EARFCN on the band found in the

additionalFreqBandList attribute. This alternative EARFCN is used to

configure the measurement object in the UE, if this frequency is selected for the UE.

## 3.5 Mobility and Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

This feature can modify the way target cells or frequencies are configured in the UE

when the UE is moved from the cell.

When the eNodeB moves a UE from the cell using Release with Redirect to another frequency or

with handover to another cell, this feature can modify the way the target cell or frequency is

configured in the UE.

### 3.5.1 Release with Measurement-Based Redirect

The eNodeB releases the UE with a measurement-based redirect under certain

conditions.

The eNodeB releases the UE with a redirect to a frequency reported by a measurement. The

measurement object is configured on an alternative

frequency. The release message to the

UE uses the same alternative EARFCN.

For more information, see Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity.

### 3.5.2 Blind Release with Redirect

The eNodeB releases the UE with a handover to a predefined cell under certain

conditions.

The eNodeB releases the UE with a redirect to a frequency found in the MOM. However, an

alternative EARFCN is used in the release message to the UE, under the following

conditions:

- Coverage is such that a release can be done without a measurement searching for a target cell on this frequency.
- The UE only supports this frequency given that it can use one of the alternative bands in the EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList, of the EUtranFrequency attribute corresponding to the selected EUtranFreqRelation attribute.

For more information and examples, see Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity.

### 3.5.3 Outgoing Intra-LTE Handover

Several features can initiate handover to cells on LTE frequencies.

Several features can trigger an inter-frequency handover to a cell on the same, or on

different LTE frequencies. The handover process is similar for all the following features:

- The Intra-LTE Handover feature supports intra-frequency handover, triggered by coverage.
- The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover and the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity features together support the inter-frequency handover, triggered by poor coverage.
- The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover and the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage features together support the inter-frequency handover, triggered by poor coverage using a search zone concept.
- The Inter-frequency Load Balancing and the Inter-Frequency Offload features support the inter-frequency handover, triggered by high load.
- The MBMS Multi-Carrier Suppor feature supports inter-frequency handover triggered by an MBMSInterestIndication message.

The different features handle Multiple Frequency Band Indicators for handover in the

following way:

1. Finding a set of possible target frequencies:
    - The Intra-LTE Handover feature is the serving frequency. When MFBI is operable, then the UE might have connected using one of the additional EARFCNs of the cell.
    - The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover and the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity use predetermined frequencies. When determining if a frequency can be used with the UE, the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature might make it possible to select frequencies which otherwise are not supported by the UE. This is achieved by comparing the UE supported bands with the bands which appear in the EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or the EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attributes, but does not appear in the EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList attribute to the selected EUtranFreqRelation MOC.
    - The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover and the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage features use predetermined frequencies. When determining if a frequency can be used with the UE, the Multiple Frequency Bend Indicators feature might make it possible to select frequencies which otherwise are not supported by the UE. This is achieved by comparing the UE supported bands with the bands appearing in the EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList, but not the EUtranFrequency.excludeAdditionalFreqBandList attribute corresponding to the selected EUtranFreqRelation MOC.
    - The Inter-frequency Load Balancing and the Inter-Frequency Offload features indicate the frequency for the selected load balancing target cell. When determining the possible candidate load balancing target cells, the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature might be used to select frequencies and cells, which otherwise are not supported by the UE. This is achieved by comparing the UE supported bands with the bands appearing in the EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or EUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList, but not the exclude EUtranFrequancy.additionalFreqBandList of the corresponding to the selected EUtranFreqRelation.
    - The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support indicates the frequency the UE is including in the MBMSInterestIndication message. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, the eNodeB ensures that an EARFCN the UE supports is used.
2. Starting measurements to detect when it is time to initiate the handover:
    - The Intra-LTE Handover feature indicates the A3 measurements. When the UE has connected using one of the additional EARFCNs of the serving cell, this EARFCN is used when configuring the measurement object for the A3 measurement.
    - The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover and the Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity features enable the A2 measurements, which can initiate a blind handover. A3 or A5 measurements can trigger a handover. If the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature was necessary for selecting a frequency, then an EARFCN on one of the additional bands is used when the measurement object for the A5 measurement or A3 measurement is configured in the UE. When the UE has connected using one of the additional EARFCNs of the serving cell, this EARFCN is used for configuring the measurement object for the A2 measurement.
    - The Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover and the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage features enable the A2 measurements, which can initiate a blind handover, and the A5 or A3 measurements in the search zone can trigger a handover. If the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature was necessary for selecting a frequency, then an EARFCN on one of the additional bands is used when the measurement object for the A5 or A3 measurement is configured in the UE. When the UE has connected using one of the additional EARFCNs of the serving cell, this EARFCN is used when configuring the measurement object for the A2 measurement.
    - The Inter-frequency Load Balancing and the Inter-Frequency Offload features enable an A5 measurement, which is configured to detect a load balancing target cell. If the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, and the selected target cell is on a frequency which requires Multiple Frequency Band Indicators support, then an EARFCN on one of the additional bands is used when the measurement object for the A5 measurement is configured in the UE.
    - The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature enables an A5 measurement, which is configured to detect a cell on the requested frequency. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicator feature is operable and the selected target frequency requires Multiple Frequency Band Indicator support, an EARFCN on one of the additional bands is used when the measurement object for the A5 measurement is configured in the UE.
3. Target cell selection based on the measurement report, and handover initiation: The selected cell corresponds to the EUtranCellRelation MOC from the serving cell which fulfills some criteria, such the isHoAllowedattribute set to true. When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable and the reported cell is on a frequency which requires Multiple Frequency Band Indicators support, the following additional requirements apply:
    - One of the UE supported bands must appear in the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList, or ExternalEUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute. Note: It is not guaranteed that there is such a band. Even if there is, it is not guaranteed to be the same band as the one used for the measurement, since it is selected from a different list.
    - The eNodeB handling the target cell must also support the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature. For cells belonging to other eNodeB than the selected source cell, this is reflected in the ExternalENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport attribute. When a new ExternalENodeBFunction MOC is automatically created by the eNodeB, the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is disabled by default towards that ExternalENodeBFunction MOC. For non-Ericsson eNodeBs, or eNodeBs handled by other OSS, the OSS and the SNAD cannot synchronize the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators support indicator. Therefore all automatically created ExternalENodeBFunction sets the value of the ExternalENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport to the same value as of the attribute ENodeBFunction.mfbiSupportPolicy.

### 3.5.4 Handling Handovers Using Sticky EARFCN

The sticky EARFCN function can be used for performance optimization.

If the UE is connected to an extra band using Intra-Cell Handover or Multiple Frequency

Band Indicator Priority Rel-12, then the performance optimization can be done by doing

the following handovers:

- Intra-frequency
- X2
- Intra-eNodeB handover directly to the same EARFCN in target cell

This can be done under following conditions:

- The UE is connected to additional band on the source cell.
- The band to which the UE is connected is not the first supported band by the UE. For example, if the source cell uses frequency of B66 and UE does not support B66 but supports B4 and B10, then the UE needs to be connected to B10 to fulfill the condition.
- The Carrier Aggregation feature is operable.
- Both the source and the target cells have the same EARFCN.
- The value of the ENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport attribute is set to true. Note: Apply this setting in both eNodeBs for X2 handover.
- The value of the ENodeBFunction.caAwareMfbiIntraCellHo attribute is set to true. Note: Apply this setting in both eNodeBs for X2 handover.

### 3.5.5 Handling Handovers Using Multiple Frequency Band Indicators with Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

For incoming and outgoing handovers, the eNodeB determines EARFCN for the

UE.

The eNodeB determines EARFCN for the UE during incoming and outgoing handover by checking

the following attributes:

- During outgoing X2 handover: ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled ExternalEUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrioExt and ExternalEUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrioExt EUtranFrequency.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio Note: Only checked if value of the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrioExt or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrioExt attribute is undefined. UE capability: freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 ExternalEUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList or ExternalEUtranCellTDD.additionalFreqBandList If the target eNodeB is an Ericsson eNodeB, then it checks if the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 is supported
- During outgoing intra-eNodeB handover: The target EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio UE capability: freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 The target EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList
- During incoming S1 or intra-eNodeB handover: EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio UE capability: freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList
- During incoming X2 handover: ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio UE capability: freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 EUtranCellFDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList or EUtranCellTDD.prioAdditionalFreqBandList If source eNodeB is an Ericsson eNodeB, then check if the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 is supported
- For intra-eNodeB and X2 handovers stickyEARFCN has higher priority, when possible.

## 3.6 Incoming Handover

Without activating the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators, the eNodeB can reject the

incoming handover request, if the incoming UE does not support the primary band of the target

cell.

Incoming handover requests received by the eNodeB are rejected, if the incoming UE does not

support the primary band of the target cell, and the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

feature is not activated. If the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is activated, the

eNodeB verifies that the UE supports one of the additional bands of the target cell, in the

same way as is done when an UE connects. The eNodeB includes an EARFCN on a band that the UE

can support in the handover command message, or a downlink EARFCN on a band that the UE can

support.

UE Connects Using Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

## 3.7 Carrier Aggregation and Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature affects several features and functions

related to Carrier Aggregation.

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature affects the following features and aspects of

Carrier Aggregation:

- Carrier Aggregation
- Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation

- SCell evaluation, selection, reselection, and configuration When the SCell candidates are evaluated, the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature enables the eNodeB to select cells on frequencies where the UE requires one of the alternative bands in the EUtranCellFDD.additionalFreqBandList attribute. The check for the allowed band combination is done using the selected band for the SCell and the band the UE is using for the PCell. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.101.
- Carrier Aggregation related measurements The A1 measurement, the A2 measurement, and the A6 measurement to discover a better SCell used by the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation feature are handled according to Configuring Measurements with Multiple Frequency Band Indicators Support.
- Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band is an enhancement to the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature UEs can support Carrier Aggregation on the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators additional band even if they cannot support it on the primary band. If so, the eNodeB immediately triggers an intra-cell handover to the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators additional band. This occurs after initial context setup, reestablishment, and incoming handover. The result increases the availability of Carrier Aggregation. Note: If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled, and the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute is set to DECONF\_SCELLS, then intra-cell handover is disabled when the following actions are performed with voice bearer: Initial context setup Handover RRC connection re-establishment It is possible for operators to prioritize between the bands, regardless of the general Carrier Aggregation possibilities for the band in use. The most prioritized band with valid Carrier Aggregation combinations is then chosen. The sticky EARFCN function optimizes the performance by doing the intra-frequency X2 or intra-eNodeB handover directly to the same EARFCN in the target cell as the one used in the source cell. This function is enabled by setting the ENodeBFunction.caAwareMfbiIntraCellHo to true. If the ENodeBFunction.useBandPrioritiesInSCellEval attribute is set to true, then the prioAdditionalFreqBandList attribute in the cell is used to prioritize the selected bands. If the ENodeBFunction.prioritizeAdditionalBands attribute is set to true, then the additional bands have higher priority than the primary band. Note: If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is activated on Carrier Aggregation, and the EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute is set to DECONF\_UL\_SUPPRESS\_DL\_SCELLS, then the SCell configuration and de-configuration is suppressed during an active VoLTE call.
- The Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement to the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature. If the UE supports band prioritization and at least one additional band of a cell, or the primary band, then the UE connects to the additional band during the following events: Initial connection setup Connection reestablishment Handover This increases the use of Carrier Aggregation, when the following are possible: Carrier aggregation combinations on the additional band, but not on the primary band More carrier aggregation combinations on the additional band If the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 enhancement is enabled on the cell, then the number of intra-cell handovers introduced by the intra-cell handover to additional band function is decreased. This is because the UE supports this function to allocate the additional band from the start. It is also possible for the operator to prioritize between the bands. The UE connects to the available additional band with the highest priority. For the stickyEARFCN function, the Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band function has to be enabled together with this feature. In this case, intra-cell X2 or intra-eNodeB handover is done directly to the same EARFCN in the target cell as used in the source cell. For a successful RRC connection reestablishment to a cell where band prioritization is activated, the source eNodeB has to support band prioritization. This enhancement affects security key derivation, when the source cell does not support band prioritization. The security key is not accepted by a target eNodeB that has Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 activated. In this case, the reestablishment procedure is rejected and no context fetch request is sent. The described RRC connection reestablishment solution is limited to the Ericsson eNodeBs, because it uses the Ericsson-specific Private Message in the X2 Protocol. This enhancement is activated using the EUtranCellFDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio or the EUtranCellTDD.mfbiFreqBandIndPrio attribute on the cell.

## 3.8 Supporting Multiple Frequency Band Indicators in Other eNodeBs

For successful handovers, the value of the

ExternalENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport attribute must be checked to determine

if the target eNodeB supports the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature.

To be able to initiate a handover to a cell where the UE does not support the primary band,

and the cell is handled by a different target eNodeB, the target eNodeB has to support the

Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature.  This is done by checking the value of the

ExternalENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport attribute. The value of this attribute

is automatically synchronized between Ericsson eNodeBs using the OSS SNAD feature. For

non-Ericsson eNodeBs this attribute has to be set manually by the operator for the feature to

work properly.

When the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor Support on X2 enhancement is

activated on the feature, the ExternalENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport attribute

has to show the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators support status on the neighboring

eNodeB.

In case the ExternalENodeBFunction.mfbiSupport attribute has a different

value than the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators support status on the neighboring eNodeB the

handover might fail.

# 4 Network Impact of Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

This feature has impact on network mobility, as it supports UEs in poor coverage

triggered mobility and load balancing situations.

Capacity and Performance

The Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature can impact mobility in the network. How

significant the impact is, depends on the frequency bands used for the cells, and the UE in

the network. If the cells are configured on frequencies and bands where there are other

overlapping bands, and there are UE in the network which does not directly support these

bands, but supports multiple frequency band indicators and the overlapping bands. The

Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature ensures that these UEs are supported when

mobility is triggered by poor coverage, load balancing, or other reasons.

When the Shared

LTE RAN feature is enabled, it is important to note that the requirement that a

frequency is always represented by the same EARFCN is valid for the complete shared

network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

The feature introduces MOM attributes to monitor frequency bands and their spectrum

emission.

# 7 Activate Multiple Frequency Band Indicators

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011485 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

## 7.1 Activate Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 for X2 Handovers

Various restrictions must be considered before the activation of the Frequency Band

Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2 enhancement. The

ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute must be set to

true for nodes that only have neighbor eNodeBs capable to handle X2

inter-eNodeB handover with additional band prioritization.

Before the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2 interface

is enabled, consider the restrictions of the

enhancement.

Activation of the Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2

enhancement must proceed by setting the

ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled to true only

for nodes that only have neighboring eNodeBs capable to handle X2 inter-eNodeB handover

with additional band prioritization. It means that all neighboring eNodeBs must support

the Frequency Band Indicator Priority over X2 function, regardless of the value of

mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled parameter on said eNodeBs.

These conditions can be fulfilled in the following way:

| Expected configuration   |    | The following types of eNodeBs can exist in a customer Radio Access                         Network:    Other vendor eNodeBs with activated Frequency Band Indicator Priority                                 over X2 for specific EARFCNs.     Similar Ericsson eNodeBs with the configuration of Frequency Band                                 Indicator Priority over X2 with the value of the                                     ENodeBFunction.mfbiFbipOnX2Enabled attribute                                 set to true.   |

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q2: Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

This enhancement of the MFBI feature provides support for frequency band prioritization, allowing the UE to connect to an additional band even when it supports the primary band as well.

| Feature Name:           | Multiple Frequency Band Indicators   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3054 R5                      |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R11                     |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node   |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                  |

Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 is an enhancement to the MFBI feature. If a UE

supports band prioritization and at least one additional band of a cell, it connects to

the additional band, both during initial connection setup and connection

reestablishment. This can occur even when it supports the primary band as well.

This increases the use of CA in two cases. One case is when there are possible CA

combinations on the additional band, but not on the primary band, and the other is when

there are more possible CA combinations on the additional band. When Intra-Cell Handover

to Additional Band is enabled together with this feature, intra-cell handovers for UEs

supporting band prioritization are not performed because the UE connects to the

additional band by default.

It is also possible for the operator to prioritize between the bands. The UE connects to the

available additional band with the highest priority.

It is recommended to enable Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band together with this feature,

for the sticky handover functionality. In this case, inter-cell handover is done

directly to the same band in the target cell as used in the source cell.

RRC connection reestablishment to a cell where band prioritization is activated is only

successful if the source eNodeB also supports band prioritization. Because this

enhancement affects security key derivation, when the source cell does not support band

prioritization, the security key it sends is not accepted by a target eNodeB that has

Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 activated. In this case, the reestablishment

procedure is rejected and no context fetch request is sent.

The RRC connection reestablishment solution described above is limited to Ericsson eNodeBs,

because it uses the Ericsson specific Private Message in the X2 Protocol.

Capacity and Performance

CA usage increases as more UEs are able to utilize CA.

Initial context setup time decreases when Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band is enabled

because of the smaller number of required intra-cell handovers.

Interfaces

This change affects the following 3GPP defined interfaces:

- RRC protocol (TS 36.331) Two new IEs from 3GPP Release 12 are supported: freqBandIndicatorPriority-r12: if the feature is activated on the eNodeB, this IE is broadcast in SIB1. freqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12: if UE supports band prioritization, this IE is set to 1 in UE-EUTRA-Cability.
- X2AP (TS 36.423) New data is added to the Ericsson-specific Private Message between the eNodeBs. It indicates whether the eNodeB supports band prioritization, and whether the feature is activated on the target cell for the RRC Connection Reestablishment.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

UE must support band prioritization, which is indicated by having

reqBandPriorityAdjustment-r12 set to 1 in UE-EUTRA-Capability.

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q2: Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2

The Frequency Band Indicator Priority rel-12 Multi-Vendor support on X2 enhancement

enables the UE to support connecting to the additional band during S1, X2 and intra-eNB

handovers.

| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3054                         |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                  |

Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12 during X2 handovers is a further enhancement of

the MFBI feature.

If a UE supports band prioritization and at least one additional band of a cell, it

connects to the additional band not only at initial connection setup and

reestablishment, but also at S1, X2 and intra-eNB handovers. This can occur even when it

supports the primary band as well.

This enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Less intra-cell handovers because of direct X2, S1 and Intra-eNB handovers to additional bands
- Direct handovers are possible even when Sticky-EARFCN is not possible

This enhancement uses the same priorities between the bands which are already defined for

SIB1.

It is recommended to enable Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band feature together with

this feature, for UEs which do not support Frequency Band Indicator Priority Rel-12

functionality.

In this case, inter-cell handover is done directly to the same band in the target cell

as used in the source cell.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement has the following benefits:

- CA usage increases as more UEs are able to utilize CA.
- Smaller number of intra-cell handovers are required when Intra-Cell Handover to Additional Band is enabled because the inter-cell handovers are done directly to the Additional Band for UEs which support this request.
