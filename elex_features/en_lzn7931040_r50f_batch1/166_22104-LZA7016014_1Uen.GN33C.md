Summary

The main benefit of the Cell Sleep Mode feature is automatic energy saving.

In densely populated networks, overlaid cells are deployed. Without this feature,

cells are constantly turned on. With the Cell Sleep Mode feature, the overlaid

capacity cells can detect low traffic conditions and turn off to save energy with

confirmed support from overlaid coverage cells. The overlaid coverage cell monitors

traffic conditions to turn on the sleeping cells. This is a SON capability that is

adaptive to the network traffic conditions.

When an overlaid capacity cell is turned off, the traffic load in the cell is

offloaded to overlaid coverage cells. Overlaid coverage cells can be configured

manually or automatically. The Cell Sleep Mode feature provides Coverage Cell

Discovery, which can automatically detect neighbor cells that are capable to serve

as overlaid coverage cells. Enabling the Cell Sleep Mode feature is not required in

overlaid coverage cells.

Once overlaid capacity cells are turned off for energy saving reasons, the CRS

interference is reduced in the network. Therefore, UE throughput can be

improved.

Capacity cells are dynamically and automatically turned on and off based on the

current traffic load. This reduces power consumption and inter-cell interference.

Therefore, the Cell Sleep Mode feature can reduce OPEX.

Figure 1   Example Scenario for Energy Saving for E-UTRAN

In this scenario, E-UTRAN Cells C, D, E, F, and G are covered by E-UTRAN Cells A and

B. Here, Cell A and Cell B have been deployed to provide basic coverage, while the

other E-UTRAN cells boost the capacity. When some cells that provide additional

capacity are no longer needed, they can be switched off to save energy. In this

case, both the continuity of the LTE coverage and the QoS is guaranteed by coverage

cells.

If the conditions for entering MIMO sleep mode are met during the cell         sleep mode time window, MIMO sleep mode can be triggered. If the conditions for entering         cell sleep state are met, the capacity cell enters sleep state and MIMO Sleep state is         deactivated, as cell sleep mode is prioritized.  A coverage cell can only enter MIMO sleep mode without waking         up capacity cells if CellSleepFunction.isAllowedMsmOnCovCell is set to         true or MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode is set to           ADVANCED_SWITCH. In this case, new sleep requests from capacity cells are         not rejected.  If MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode is set to           SWITCH or SOFT_SWITCH and           CellSleepFunction.isAllowedMsmOnCovCell is set to false when a coverage         cell enters MIMO sleep mode, it triggers dependent capacity cells to wake up and reject new         sleep requests.  If the Cell Sleep Mode feature and the MIMO Sleep Mode feature are         active in the same node, and the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled,         the following setup is recommended to avoid sending indication to the coverage cell that the         wake-up of another sleeping capacity cell is necessary before MIMO sleep mode is deactivated:  The MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is recommended to be set               to ADVANCED_SWITCH.

Limitations

The feature is only supported on Ericsson eNodeB and is not supported with AAS radios

for LTE. For more information on the list of supported and unsupported features, see

LTE RAN Feature Status.

If a capacity cell and its coverage cells are not on the same eNodeB, X2 connection

is mandatory.

The radio of a coverage cell can consume more power than the radio of a capacity cell

when they are under the same traffic load condition. It is recommended to use low

sleep and wake-up thresholds to prevent excessive traffic load or power consumption

on the coverage cells. It is also recommended to set low sleep and wake-up

thresholds for either of the following circumstances:

- When the coverage cell uses a macro radio, while the capacity cell uses a micro radio.
- When the coverage cell discovery is enabled.

Both the capacity cell and the coverage cell must support the following attributes,

to handle high-traffic conditions:

- CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThresHigh
- CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThresHigh
- CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTHigh

Each capacity cell supports up to 10 coverage cells.

The sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is only supported in deployments in

which there are no cells defined as both capacity and coverage and in which the

cells are overlapping each other.

When the cell is configured to sleep by setting the value of the

CellSleepFunction.capCellRequiredActivationTime attribute to

less than 15, the feature is supported on the following cells:

- NB-IoT cell
- ESS FDD cell
- Combined cell

The feature is not supported on radio unit with Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI

link card configurations.

Network Requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

# 3 Cell Sleep Mode Feature Operation

In a network with overlaid cells deployed, some are basic coverage cells, and others are

capacity cells. The Cell Sleep Mode feature offers a method for the capacity cells to go

into energy saving mode automatically when they are under-utilized during low or no

traffic conditions and to resume services automatically when traffic demand resumes by

coverage cell.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 2   Cell Sleep Mode End-to-End Operation Sequence

Process Steps

1. Operator activates and configures the Cell Sleep Mode feature on the capacity cells.
2. Coverage cells are automatically configured by activating coverage cell discovery or the operator manually configures the relations which provide coverage. For more information, see Configure Coverage Cell.
3. If the traffic in the capacity cell is less than the threshold for the specified duration, the capacity cell sends a cell sleep start request to the coverage cell.
4. The coverage cell performs a check to validate the cell sleep start request. For more information, see Validation Check by Coverage Cell for Capacity Cell to Enter Cell Sleep.
5. If the coverage cell accepts the cell sleep start request, the capacity cell automatically enters sleep state. For more information, see Entering Cell Sleep.Note: If there are multiple coverage cell relations, the capacity cell sends the cell sleep start request to each coverage cell. In this case, all coverage cells must accept the cell sleep start request for the capacity cell to enter sleep state.
6. The assigned coverage cells are requested to perform wake-up detection.
7. A coverage cell automatically signals the capacity cell to exit sleep state, for example, in the following use cases: For more information on all applicable conditions, see Wake Up Detection by Coverage Cell and Exiting Cell Sleep.
    - The traffic of the coverage cell increases above wake-up thresholds.
    - A coverage hole is suspected to occur.
    - PWS notification is received.
    - The coverage cell state must be changed.
8. A capacity cell automatically exits sleep state (Activate cell) when its sleep criteria are not fulfilled. For more information, see the following documentation:
    - Wake Up Detection by Capacity Cell
    - Exiting Cell Sleep
9. Optionally, a neighbor cell can automatically signal the capacity cell to exit sleep state (Activate cell) for coverage support when a UE without capability for coverage frequency band is not in good coverage. For more information, see Wake Up Detection by Neighbor Cell and Exiting Cell Sleep.
10. If the capacity cell is woken up by coverage cell on suspicion of a coverage hole or during PWS broadcast, cell is prohibited from entering sleep state. For more information, see Cell Sleep Prohibition.
11. The capacity cell returns to normal state to provide service. The capacity cell repeats sleep detection from step 3.

## 3.1 Configure Coverage Cell Relations

Coverage cell relations can be manually or automatically configured.

If the coverage cell is not on the same eNodeB as the capacity cell, the following

conditions must be met:

- The coverage cell eNodeB must be must be and Ericsson eNodeB.
- The coverage cell eNodeB and the capacity cell eNodeB must have a valid X2 connection.

Coverage cell relations can be configured through one of the following methods:

- If the value of the CellSleepFunction.coverageCellDiscovery attribute is set to false, the coverage cell is configured manually for the cell relation to be used as a coverage cell relation. This can be done by setting the value of the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCovCellCandidate attribute to ALLOWED.
- If the value of the CellSleepFunction.coverageCellDiscovery attribute is set to true, the system configures the coverage cell relation automatically by setting the value of the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCoverageCell attribute to true if a cell relation is discovered as a coverage cell relation.

Capacity cells can have more than one coverage cell relation depending on the network

deployment. Adding a coverage cell relation does not affect the current state of the

capacity cell, instead, it takes effect when a capacity cell sends the cell sleep start

request. If a coverage cell relation is added, the capacity cell sends the next cell sleep

start request to that coverage cell as well.

If a coverage cell relation is manually removed while the capacity cell is in sleep state,

the wake-up process is automatically performed on the capacity cell.

Manual configuration can be made by setting the value of the

EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCovCellCandidate attribute corresponding to

coverage cell relations to ALLOWED. This enables configuring a coverage

cell by selecting cell relations on the preferred frequency manually.

The automatic configuration of coverage cell relations is performed by activating coverage

cell discovery capability. Coverage cell discovery is a continuous process. It aims to

automatically detect which neighbor relations can be coverage cell by using hit-rate

estimation and configure coverage cells. Coverage cell discovery detects only

inter-frequency neighbor relation as coverage cell.

Hit-rate is defined as the likelihood of a UE candidate in the source cell to be qualified

for off-load to a certain target cell. It reflects the target cell coverage with respect to

the UE density and distribution in the source cell.

Periodic measurement is used to estimate the hit-rate value for each target cell.

Periodic measurement is requested to inactive UE, as described in 3GPP

TS 36.331. According to this standard, the following applies:

- purpose is set to reportStrongestCells
- maxReportCells is set to 1
- reportAmount is set to r1 on the following conditions: The UE is Release 10 or later. There is no SCell configured for the UE. reportAmount is set to r2 if these conditions are not fulfilled.

The hit-rate value of target cells is updated using reported measurement from UE. Periodic

measurement is requested only for inter-frequency where the

EUtranrFreqRelation.cellSleepCovCellMeasOn attribute is set to

true.

Target number of periodic measurement is controlled by attributes of the

CellSleepNodeFunction MO class. Target number means how many periodic

measurements need to be requested per hour. For a period of time after coverage cell

discovery is activated, the target number of the measurements is not decreased. The

intention is to keep high target number at the beginning of coverage cell discovery to get

enough hit-rate statistics.

The hit-rate value of each target cell is used to decide coverage cells of the source cell

by the following steps:

Steps

1. Find coverage cell candidates with hit-rate greater than CellSleepNodeFunction.csmMinHitRateForCovCell for each E-UTRAN inter-frequency relation. Target cells are aggregated for the same frequency to achieve the highest sum of hit-rate. The number of selected coverage cells has to be as high as possible but must not exceed the internally defined number. The sum of hit-rate of all selected coverage cells must be greater than or equal to the value of the ENodeBFunction.csmMinHighHitThreshold attribute. Note: Depending on the specific environment, configuring the internally defined maximum number of selected coverage cells can be necessary. Contact the Ericsson personnel to configure the internal parameter if issues are observed with the coverage cell detection algorithm.
2. Select a frequency, which meets the following conditions: The highest hit-rate sum value. The least number of aggregated cells. This condition is used if multiple frequencies satisfy the first condition with the same hit-rate sum.
3. Coverage cell candidates of the selected frequency are finally configured as coverage cells of the source cell by setting the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCoverageCell attribute corresponding to the cell to true. Note: When automatic coverage cell configuration is applied, a node or cell restart automatically initiates a new coverage cell discovery process to find new coverage cell relations to be used. Therefore, the discovered coverage cells are erased and all the hit-rate values are reset. A capacity cell cannot enter sleep state until the new coverage cells are discovered.

## 3.2 Detecting Cell Sleep Opportunity

The current traffic load is checked every minute in a capacity cell to detect the

opportunity of entering cell sleep state to save energy. The following steps are

performed:

1. If the following conditions are satisfied, the capacity cell checks for low traffic load: Note: The calculation of moving average of the traffic is applied during cell sleep opportunity detection. For more information about the moving average traffic calculation, see Moving Average Traffic Algorithm. If sleep threshold or duration timer is changed while the cell is performing sleep detection, the new value takes effect immediately.
    - Downlink PRB use percentage in the local cell must be less than or equal to CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold.
    - Number of RRC connections in the local cell must be less than or equal to CellSleepFunction.capCellRrcConnSleepThreshold, if cell type is not downlink-only.
    - Both conditions must remain true for at least the duration of CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepMonitorDurTimer.
2. A capacity cell sends a cell sleep start request to coverage cells if the traffic load conditions in step 1 and all the following conditions are met: Note: If there are multiple coverage cell relations, the capacity cell sends the cell sleep start request to all current coverage cells. A capacity cell can only enter the sleep state if all coverage cells accept the cell sleep start request. Before sending the cell sleep start request, the following operations can be performed on the measured traffic offload of the capacity cell: The measured downlink PRB use of the offload traffic can be manually or automatically adjusted by using the CellSleepFunction.prbOffloadAdjust attribute. The measured number of active RRC connections in the offload traffic can be manually or automatically adjusted by using the CellSleepFunction.rrcOffloadAdjust attribute.
    - Local cell MbsfnAreaCellRelation.mbsfnAreaCellStatus must be deactivated.
    - If the ENodeBFunction.checkEmergencySoftLock attribute is set to true, local cell must have no active emergency calls.
    - Local cell is operationally enabled and not degraded. This means that the value of the EUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is set to ENABLED. Meanwhile, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or the EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is set to NO\_STATUS.
    - The cell is not shutting down. This means that the value of the EUtranCellFDD.administrativeState or the EUtranCellTDD.administrativeState attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is not set to SHUTTINGDOWN.
    - If the EUtranFreqRelation.csmUeCapMonitorEnabled attribute corresponding to the coverage frequency is set to true, and all UEs connected for last EUtranFreqRelation.csmUeCapMonitorTime time period support coverage frequency band. If this condition is not passed, the corresponding EUtranCellFDD.pmCellSleepFailUeCap or the EUtranCellTDD.pmCellSleepFailUeCap counter is stepped.
    - The total number of incoming X2 Inter-frequency handovers with cause value Handover Desirable for Radio Reasons from neighbor cells with coverage frequency is less than CellSleepFunction.capCellMobReasNotSleepThr during the CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepMonitorDurTimer period.
    - Cell is not prohibited from entering sleep state. Prohibition is indicated by the CellSleepFunction.sleepProhibitStartTime attribute.
    - Cell is not prohibited from entering sleep state. Prohibition is set for cells indicated in the Warning Area List during PWS broadcast.

## 3.3 Validation Check by Coverage Cell for Capacity Cell to Enter Cell Sleep

After receiving a cell sleep start request from a capacity cell, the coverage cell performs

the following checks on itself to assess whether the capacity cell can enter sleep state:

- Checks if the coverage cell has the capacity cell relation defined.
- Checks if the coverage cell is not overloaded from traffic and MP load perspective.
- Checks if the coverage cell is not in cell sleep state.
- Checks if the coverage cell is not in MIMO sleep state. This condition is not applicable if the CellSleepFunction.isAllowedMsmOnCovCell attribute is set to TRUE or if the MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is set to ADVANCED\_SWITCH or MI\_SWITCH.
- Checks if the coverage cell is not DL-only.
- Checks if the coverage cell has the capacity to accept traffic offload from the requesting capacity cell. The capacity cell sends a sleep start request to identified coverage cells with wake-up thresholds and current traffic load, that is, the number of RRC connections and downlink PRB utilization. The values are included in the CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold and CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold attributes. If the number of coverage cells is larger than one, half of the current traffic load is sent to coverage cells. The coverage cell decides whether to accept or reject the sleep start request from the capacity cell. If all the following conditions are fulfilled, the coverage cell accepts the sleep start request from the capacity cell: (number of RRC connections (capacity cell) + number of RRC connection (coverage cell)) &lt; CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold (DL PRB utilization (capacity cell) + DL RPB utilization (coverage cell)) &lt; CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold

## 3.4 Entering Cell Sleep

If a capacity cell is monitoring other sleeping capacity cells

for wake-up as coverage cell, it requests activation of sleeping capacity

cells before entering cell sleep.

To enter sleep state, the cell must be deactivated. Prior to deactivating a cell, soft lock

operation is performed internally to move out existing traffic, enabling the cell to be

deactivated. When a cell is deactivated, the following happens:

- Uplink and downlink branches on radio are deactivated to achieve energy saving.
- The CellSleepFunction.sleepState attribute is set to ACTIVATED.
- The EUtranCellFDD.operationalState or EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to DISABLED, and no other feature can operate. During this period, no feature-specific counter increments.
- The EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to OFF\_DUTY.
- The EUtranCellFDD.pmCellSleepTime or EUtranCellTDD.pmCellSleepTime counter starts incrementing.

## 3.5 Wake Up Detection by Coverage Cell

Any of the following conditions of the coverage cell can satisfy the wake-up detection for a

capacity cell:

- Checking if traffic load is above wake-up thresholds. The coverage cell tracks its own cell load every minute using the wake-up thresholds received from the capacity cell sleep start request. The feature provides the possibility to configure two levels of conditions, either normal-traffic or high-traffic. Using high-traffic thresholds enables faster wake-up for cells in sudden traffic load increase. The CellSleepFunction.wakeUpTrafficCriteria attribute can be used to configure the conditions for wake-up detection in coverage cells. The high-traffic detection state can be disabled by setting the CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTHigh attribute value to 0. Note: The calculation of moving average of the traffic is applied during wake-up cell detection by coverage cell. For more information about the moving average traffic calculation, see Moving Average Traffic Algorithm. If wake-up threshold or duration timer value is changed during sleep state, the new value does not take effect until next Sleep Request.
- Checking if coverage hole is suspected. A coverage hole can occur if coverage cells are configured inappropriately or a capacity cell provides coverage support. Coverage cells continuously collect UE lost rate and RRC connection Re-establishment rate statistics: UE lost rate = number of UEs Lost / number of UE Context Releases RRC connection Re-establishment rate = number of RRC re-establishments / number of RRC connection Establishment Attempts Statistics are divided into normal and sleep statistics: Normal statistics are gathered when none of the capacity cells are in sleep mode. They are further divided into latest statistics, which are gathered during the last 24 hours, and old statistics, which are older than 24 hours. The weight of latest statistics for normal statistics calculation is defined by the CellSleepFunction.covCellLatestStatsAdaRatio attribute. Normal statistics are calculated from the following formula: normal statistics = latest statistics × CellSleepFunction.covCellLatestStatsAdaRatio + old statistics × (1 − CellSleepFunction.covCellLatestStatsAdaRatio). Sleep statistics are gathered when any capacity cell is in sleep mode. A coverage hole is suspected when any of the following conditions apply: The difference between sleep statistics and normal statistics for UE lost rate must be greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellUeLostWakeUpThr. or The difference between sleep statistics and normal statistics for RRC connection re-establishment rate must be greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcReestWakeUpThr.
- The operationalState or the availabilityStatus attribute of the cell must be changed in the following conditions: Coverage cell is locked or node is restarted. Coverage cell is operationally disabled. This means that the value of the EUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to DISABLED. Meanwhile, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or the EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is set to a status other than NO\_STATUS, DEGRADED, and OFF\_DUTY. Coverage cell is degraded. This means that the value of theEUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to ENABLED. Meanwhile, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or the EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is set to DEGRADED.
- Coverage cell is overloaded in traffic load or MP load perspective.
- X2 connection failure to capacity cell.
- Capacity Cell Relation is being removed from use by manual configuration.
- Coverage cell enters MIMO sleep. This condition is not applicable if the CellSleepFunction.isAllowedMsmOnCovCell attribute is set to true or the MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is set to ADVANCED\_SWITCH.
- Coverage cell enters cell sleep.
- PWS (ETWS, either Primary or Secondary or both, or CMAS) notification message is received in the node. After receiving the PWS message, all coverage cells in the node initiate the immediate wake-up procedure of all related capacity cells. Capacity cells within the affected area are prevented from entering cell sleep mode during the PWS broadcast. Capacity cells can enter cell sleep mode after PWS termination.

In case of traffic overload, coverage hole suspicion, PWS notification message is received,

cell sleep, cell operational unavailability or degradation, the coverage cell wakes up all

capacity cells.

In case of X2 connection failure or capacity cell relation removal, the coverage cell wakes

up corresponding capacity cells.

Conditions for Wake-Up Detection in Coverage Cell

### 3.5.1 Conditions for Wake-Up Detection in Coverage Cell

It is possible to configure the conditions used for wake-up detection in the coverage

cell.

Table 3 shows the conditions that are used for

evaluating whether the wake-up of sleeping capacity cells is necessary:

Table 3   Conditions for Coverage Cell Wake-Up Detection

| Condition                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal Traffic RRC Connection Condition for Wake-Up Detection | The number of RRC connected UEs in the cell must be equal to or                                 higher than the value of the                                     CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold                                 attribute. |
| Normal Traffic Downlink PRB Condition for Wake-Up Detection   | The downlink PRB use percentage in the cell must be equal to or                                 higher than the value of the                                     CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold                                 attribute.   |
| High-Traffic RRC Connection Condition for Wake-Up Detection   | The number of RRC connected UEs in the cell must be equal to or                                 higher than the value of the                                     CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThresHigh                                 attribute. |
| High-Traffic Downlink PRB Condition for Wake-Up Detection     | The downlink PRB use percentage in the cell must be equal to or                                 higher than the value of the                                     CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThresHigh                                 attribute.   |

The coverage cell enters high-traffic detection state if the following conditions are

met:

- The value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTHigh attribute is higher than the value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTimer attribute.
- The value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThresHigh attribute exceeds the value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold attribute, or the value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThresHigh attribute exceeds the value of the CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold attribute.

If the conditions for entering high-traffic detection state are not met, the

high-traffic thresholds are ignored.

CellSleepFunction.wakeUpTrafficCriteria attribute that set the

normal traffic conditions for wake-up detection in the coverage cell.

## 3.6 Wake-Up Detection by Capacity Cell

Any of the following conditions of the capacity cell can satisfy the wake-up detection for a

capacity cell:

- Checking for the following configurations: Exit daily interval between the CellSleepFunction.sleepStartTime and the CellSleepFunction.sleepEndTime attributes. The Cell Sleep Mode feature is deactivated. Coverage Cell Relation is removed by manual configuration. Note: A coverage cell relation is removed in manual configuration if the value of the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCovCellCandidate attribute is set to AUTO or to NOT\_ALLOWED while the value of the CellSleepFunction.coverageCellDiscovery attribute is set to false.
- Capacity cell is locked or soft-locked, or node restart. If capacity cell is locked by other conditions, capacity cell exits cell sleep to reflect the latest cell status. When node restarts and cell resumes service, cell sleep status is reset and cell sleep detection restarts if it is within daily time interval.
- Capacity cell is operationally disabled. This means that the value of the EUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to DISABLED. Meanwhile, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or the EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is set to a status other than NO\_STATUS, DEGRADED, and OFF\_DUTY.
- Capacity cell is degraded. This means that the value of theEUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to ENABLED. Meanwhile, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or the EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of an MO instance representing a cell is set to DEGRADED.
- X2 connection failure to coverage cell.
- LTE broadcast (MBMS) session starts on the cell.
- The ESS partner NR cell is locked and unlocked. The EVENT\_VALUE\_SUPPORT\_FOR\_UNLOCKING\_ESS value is introduced in the EVENT\_PARAM\_WAKEUP\_CAUSE parameter.

## 3.7 Wake Up Detection by Neighbor Cell

Neighbor cells wake up capacity cells for coverage support when a connected UE lacking

capability for coverage frequency band is detected on the neighbor cell. Neighbor cells

wake up all adjacent capacity cells having handover attempts for the

CellSleepFunction.wakeUpLastHoTime if all the following

conditions are met:

- Condition 1: A2 measurement report for mobility purpose is received from an UE.
- Condition 2: Neighbor cell stores valid Coverage Band Information List for capacity cell. Note: Capacity cells broadcast the band information of coverage cells to neighbor cells when entering the sleep state, if EUtranFreqRelation.csmUeCapMonitorEnabled corresponding to the coverage frequency is set to true.
- Condition 3: UE cannot support a coverage cell frequency band.
- Condition 4: Handover towards the capacity cell is allowed.

If the CellSleepFunction.wakeUpWaitTimer timer is set to a value

different than 0, it is started when the request to wake up adjacent capacity cells is

sent. When the timer expires, and the following condition is met, neighbor cells wake up

all remaining capacity cells towards which handover is allowed:

- Condition 1: The UE is still not in good coverage area. When a good coverage report from the UE is received, or the UE is handed over or released, the CellSleepFunction.wakeUpWaitTimer timer is automatically canceled.

## 3.8 Exiting Cell Sleep

The following steps are performed by the capacity cell to exit cell sleep:

1. Activate cell is performed.
2. The CellSleepFunction.sleepState attribute is set to DEACTIVATED.
3. During the Activate Cell procedure, the value of the operationalState or the availabilityStatus attribute is set to the appropriate state. The value of the EUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to ENABLED. If there is a fault, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.operationalState or the EUtranCellTDD.operationalState attribute of the MO instance representing the cell might be set to DISABLED.
4. The EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of the MO instance representing the cell is set to an empty value. If there is a fault, the EUtranCellFDD.availabilityStatus or the EUtranCellTDD.availabilityStatus attribute of the MO instance representing the cell might be set to a status other than NO\_STATUS and OFF\_DUTY. Note: The cell exiting sleep mode with a related alarm might indicate a fault. In this case, the operationalState and the availabilityStatus attributes must be changed to present the current cell situation. For example, changing the value of the availabilityStatus attribute from OFF\_DUTY to DEGRADED or to DEPENDENCY\_FAILED must wake up the cell and the cell exits sleep mode. A related alarm might be raised. For more information on alarm instructions and remedy actions, see Manage Radio Network and Manage Faults.
5. The EUtranCellFDD.pmCellSleepTime or EUtranCellTDD.pmCellSleepTime counter is stopped. Note: Because of the specific sampling of the EUtranCellFDD.pmCellSleepTime and the EUtranCellTDD.pmCellSleepTime counters, the last reported value of the PM counters can exceed the maximum expected value for a single Recording Output Period (ROP) before cell wake-up. However, the total accumulated value in the ROPs is correct.

If the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled, after wake-up the capacity

cell starts traffic load supervision for Wake-up indications.

If a capacity cell exits cell sleep because of coverage hole suspicion, the following actions

take place:

- If the CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepProhibitInterval attribute does not equal 0, the CellSleepFunction.sleepProhibitStartTime attribute is set to current time.
- If the CellSleepFunction.isCleanupHitRateTable attribute is set to true, and automatic cell discovery for the cell is enabled, the following actions take place: The coverage cell list is cleared (the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCoverageCell attribute is set to false). The hit-rate table is cleared. The automatic coverage cell configuration algorithm is restarted.

## 3.9 Sequential Wake-Up of Capacity Cells

The sequential wake-up of capacity cells function makes it possible for capacity cells

to be woken up as part of a process. Capacity cells can send a wake-up indication to coverage

cells.

If the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled, the coverage cell can wake

up capacity cells individually as configured.

The following properties of the wake-up process can be configured:

- Capacity cell wake-up priority
- Sequential wake-up timer
- Threshold offsets for sending capacity cell wake-up indication

The sequential wake-up process can only be triggered by normal-traffic criteria for cell

wake-up.

The sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is only supported in deployments in which

there are no cells defined as both capacity and coverage and in which the cells are

overlapping each other.

Figure 3   Example of Sequential Wake-Up with Three Capacity Cells Overlapping the Coverage

Cell

Capacity Cell Wake-Up Priority

Capacity cell wake-up priority is used by the coverage cell to indicate which capacity

cells to prioritize when the wake-up process takes place. It is based on the

SleepModeCovProfile MO class, and the priority of each cell can be

configured using the WakeUpFreqPriority MO class.

Capacity cell wake-up priority is defined on the frequency level.

Automatic creation of a WakeUpFreqPriority MO class by the

EUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency

or

EUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency

MO action for CBRS pointing at a new frequency is possible if the following conditions are

met:

- The number of WakeUpFreqPriority MO instances under the current SleepModeCovProfile is less than the maximum allowed of 24.
- There is a WakeUpFreqPriority pointing at the old frequency, under the current SleepModeCovProfile MO instance.
- There is no already existing WakeUpFreqPriority pointing at the new frequency, under the current SleepModeCovProfile MO instance.

Sequential Wake-Up Timer

The sequential wake-up timer is used by the coverage cell to define the time between two

wake-up actions in a sequence. The timer starts when a wake-up sequence is triggered by the

coverage cell or an indication from a capacity cell. The timer can be configured using the

CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpSeqTimer attribute.

While the timer is active, the coverage cell suspends supervision of sleeping capacity

cells. No other cell can be activated in a sequence until the timer expires. If active

capacity cells send indications that a wake-up is necessary, the coverage cell stores the

indications. When the timer expires, the coverage cell resumes supervision of sleeping

capacity cells and deals with the valid indications.

Wake-Up Indication

Capacity cells are able to monitor their own traffic load. If traffic load reaches the

thresholds and is kept for the duration specified by the

CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTimer attribute, the capacity

cell sends an indication to the coverage cell that the wake-up of another sleeping capacity

cell is necessary. After receiving an indication from the capacity cell, the coverage cell

stores the information, and if there are sleeping cells, starts sequential wake-up of the

highest priority sleeping capacity cell. The thresholds for the capacity cell sending this

indication to the coverage cell are calculated in the following ways:

- The threshold for downlink PRB is the sum of the CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold and the CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpDlPrbOffset attribute values.
- The threshold for RRC connections is the sum of the CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold and the CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpRrcOffset attribute values.

If the capacity cell sends an indication to the coverage cell that the wake-up of another

sleeping capacity cell is necessary, it continues traffic load supervision to monitor the

validity of the indication. If the traffic load is kept below configured wake-up thresholds

for the duration specified by the

CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTimer attribute, the capacity

cell sends an indication that the wake-up is no longer necessary.

After receiving an indication from the capacity cell, the coverage cell removes the

previously stored information that wake-up is needed for the corresponding cell.

The coverage cell generates the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_WAKEUP\_IND\_RECEIVED PM

event when it receives an indication from the capacity cell. If a wake-up is triggered by an

indication received from a capacity cell, the coverage cell sets the value of the

EVENT\_PARAM\_WAKEUP\_CAUSE parameter in the

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_CELL\_WAKEUP\_DETECTED PM event to

EVENT\_VALUE\_SEQUENTIAL\_WAKEUP\_INDICATION.

Enhanced activation of traffic monitoring in capacity cells function can be enabled on

capacity cells by setting the

CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpIndInstMonitor attribute to

true. Monitoring is started without the need of receiving a trigger from

the coverage cell at activation request, and without the need to perform sleep and wake-up

procedure.

Wake-Up Sequence

The following events take place during the wake-up process with the sequential wake-up of

capacity cells function:

1. Wake-up event is detected for sleeping capacity cells.
2. The coverage cell checks the configured wake-up priorities of monitored sleeping capacity cells.
3. The coverage cell selects the highest priority cell from the monitored sleeping capacity cells. If there are multiple capacity cells of the same priority, the coverage cell selects one randomly.
4. The coverage cell starts the sequential wake-up timer.
5. The coverage cell disables the wake-up of other sleeping capacity cells.
6. The sleeping capacity cell with the highest wake-up priority is activated.
7. The activated capacity cell starts traffic load supervision and sends indications to the coverage cell that the wake-up of another sleeping capacity cell is necessary.
8. The sequential wake-up timer expires.
9. The coverage cell enables the wake-up of other sleeping capacity cells.
10. If the coverage cell has stored indications, or the wake-up thresholds are still reached in the coverage cell, the wake-up sequence continues with the highest priority sleeping capacity cell.
11. If the coverage cell has no stored indications and the wake-up thresholds are not reached in the coverage cell, the wake-up sequence ends.

### 3.9.1 Conditions for Sending Wake-Up Indications to Coverage Cell

Capacity cells can monitor their own traffic load and send indications to the

coverage cell.

If the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled, capacity cells can

monitor their own traffic load after activation from coverage cell, or if

CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpIndInstMonitor attribute is set to

true.

Based on the traffic load monitoring, the capacity cell can send the following types of

indication to the coverage cell:

Table 6 shows the conditions that are used to

evaluate whether the capacity cell sends indications to the coverage cell.

Table 7 shows the values of the

CellSleepFunction.wakeUpTrafficCriteria attribute that determine

the conditions for capacity cells sending indications to the coverage cell.

Table 7   Possible Configuration Options for Wake-Up Indication Conditions

## 3.10 Cell Sleep Prohibition

If the capacity cell is woken up due to coverage hole suspicion, it is prohibited from

entering cell sleep mode again for a period defined by the

CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepProhibitInterval attribute. If the

attribute is set to 0, the prohibition is disabled.

During PWS broadcast capacity cells within affected area are prevented from entering cell

sleep mode.

The CellSleepFunction.sleepProhibitStartTime attribute indicates an

active cell sleep prohibition, and contains the starting time of the prohibition. The

attribute is cleared in the following cases:

- The prohibition period expires.
- The CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepProhibitInterval attribute is set to 0.
- The cell is locked.

## 3.11 Cell Sleep Mode and MP Load Control

The periodic measurements are not started when cell component load state or

MP load control state is set to OVERLOAD.

For more information on MP Overload Protection, see Basic Load Management.

## 3.12 Consolidation of Measurement Intensity Control

The following features use the same periodic measurement function:

- Automatic SCell Management
- Automated Neighbor Relations
- Cell Sleep Mode

The measurement intensity control is consolidated among these features, which means

that the need for high intensity always supersedes the need for low intensity. The

periodic measurement intensity control is set by the highest value of the following

attributes if the corresponding feature is activated:

- Maximum target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMax AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportMax CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportMax
- Increment of the target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportIncr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportIncr CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportIncr
- Minimum target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportMin AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportMin CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportMin
- Decrement of the target value: AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmInterFMeasReportDecr AnrFunctionEUtran.anrEutranInterFMeasReportDecr CellSleepNodeFunction.csmEutranInterFMeasReportDecr

## 3.13 Moving Average Traffic Algorithm

The CellSleepFunction.movingAvgPeriod attribute is used to

calculate the moving average of the traffic.

Cell utilization time

varies,

therefore low-pass filtering is applied to smooth the characteristics before passing

them to the next processing stage.

Moving average filtering takes multiple samples to calculate an average value of

them.

The moving average window is configured using the

CellSleepFunction.movingAvgPeriod attribute. Filtering is not

applied for the processing chain if the

CellSleepFunction.movingAvgPeriod attribute is set to

1.

The moving average of the traffic consists of a specified number of downlink PRB use

samples and RRC connections. Each sample is collected every minute. The

CellSleepFunction.movingAvgPeriod attribute controls the

computing of the moving average.

The value of the CellSleepFunction.movingAvgPeriod attribute is used

as follows:

- To define the number of samples needed for average traffic calculation.
- As a prerequisite for the evaluation of the following timers: CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepMonitorDurTimer CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTimer CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTHigh
- To assess if the sleep or wake-up conditions are met to start or stop the monitoring period.

# 4 Network Impact of Cell Sleep Mode

If a cell providing additional capacity is no longer needed, it can be switched off

for improved energy saving.

Capacity and Performance

When some cells providing additional capacity are no longer needed, they can be

switched off for energy saving purposes. In this case, the continuity of LTE

coverage and service QoS are guaranteed by coverage cells.

After receiving a PWS notification message, the immediate wake-up of all related

capacity cells in the node secures faster preparation for the

expected

traffic demand increase.

A cell entering sleep state initially performs cell

soft

lock to release existing traffic. For more information,

see

the Cell Soft Lock feature.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Cell Sleep Mode

Prerequisites

The following must be fulfilled for each capacity cell at feature activation:

- The CellSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute must be set to ACTIVATED to activate basic capability. This enables the overlaid capacity cells to turn themselves off to save energy.
- The CellSleepFunction.coverageCellDiscovery attribute must be set to true to activate enhanced capability. This enables the overlaid coverage cells to be automatically discovered.
- If the CellSleepFunction.coverageCellDiscovery attribute is set to true, the following requirements are applied: One or more cell relations must have the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCovCellCandidate attribute set to AUTO or ALLOWED. This indicates that the cell is a candidate target of coverage cell discovery. One or more inter-frequency relations must have the EUtranFreqRelation.cellSleepCovCellMeasOn attribute set to true. This indicates that the frequency is a target of coverage cell discovery.
- If the CellSleepFunction.coverageCellDiscovery attribute is set to false, one or more cell relations must have the EUtranCellRelation.sleepModeCovCellCandidate attribute set to ALLOWED. This indicates that a cell is overlaid coverage. In that case, the operator is recommended to manually configure the overlaid coverage cells.
- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011958 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Cell Sleep Mode

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011958 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Cell Sleep Mode

Local time zone information must be

configured in the TimeSettings MO on the node level.

This example shows a configuration that is applicable for Sweden. Daylight saving

time in Sweden begins at 02:00 AM on the last Sunday of March, when the clock is set

forward one hour. The clock is set back one hour at 03:00 AM on the last Sunday in

October.

The start date and end date of the daylight saving time can be set by the members of

the DstRule struct in the following attributes:

- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeStartDate
- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeEndDate

The data that is transmitted in the IEs can be configured by the DstRule struct in the

timeSettings MO.

Table 12   Configuration Example

## 9.1 Adjustment of PRB and RRC to Modify Sleep Request Handling

Before being sent in the cell sleep request, the PRB usage and the number of RRC

connections measured on the capacity cell can be adjusted by setting the applicable

attribute.

In densely populated areas there can be overlapping capacity frequency cells in the site

or between sites, with neighboring frequencies. In such conditions, when the capacity

cell goes to sleep the remaining traffic is not offloaded to the corresponding coverage

cell, but is instead attracted by the neighboring frequency cells. Traffic to be

offloaded from capacity cell during transition to sleep state is measured as the number

of RRC connections and downlink PRB usage of the cell. These measurements are considered

by the coverage cell during validation check when cell sleep start request is

received.

Figure 4 shows an example with two capacity layer

frequencies and three capacity cells, with two capacity cells overlapping to an extent.

If either cell B or D goes to sleep, only part of the remaining traffic is moved to cell

A. The adjustments are only applicable to capacity cells B and D.

Figure 4   Configuration Example with PRB and RRC Adjustment

Adjusting the PRB usage and the number of RRC connections measured allows capacity cells

to have higher sleep thresholds and the coverage cell to validate and approve the sleep

requests more accurately.

It is not possible to configure different adjustment values for different coverage cells

of the same capacity cell.

If automatic adjustment is configured, handover statistics are valid only if the capacity

cell and the coverage cell are on different frequencies and the Coverage-Triggered

Inter-Frequency Handover feature is active on the node. If handover statistics are

invalid, only connected mode priority is used for calculation.

If the adjustment values are automatically calculated and cell sleep request is sent to

more than one coverage cell, the adjustment values in the

INTERNAL\_PROC\_CELL\_SLEEP\_TRIGGERED event are only shown for the

first coverage cell requested to sleep.

The following factors are considered for automatic calculation:

- The ratio between the number of successful handovers from the capacity cell to the coverage cell and the total number of outgoing handovers
- The connected mode mobility priority of the coverage cell frequency

The maximum value of the automatic adjustment is 80%.

The adjustments do not have any effect if there are no overlapping capacity cells in the

site or between sites on the capacity layer of the network.

## 9.2 Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

MIMO sleep state can be triggered during cell sleep mode time windows if conditions

for MIMO reduction are met.

If the conditions for entering MIMO sleep mode are met, and cell sleep state is not

active during the cell sleep mode time window, MIMO sleep state can be active. If the

conditions for entering cell sleep state are met, the capacity cell enters sleep state

and MIMO

sleep

state is deactivated, as cell sleep mode is prioritized.

After the capacity cell exits cell sleep state in ADVANCED\_SWITCH

and

in MI\_SWITCH modes, the capacity cell goes back to full MIMO configuration. When the

conditions for entering MIMO sleep state are met again during the cell sleep mode time

window, the

MIMO

sleep state can be activated again.

After the capacity cell exits cell sleep state in SWITCH

and

in SOFT\_SWITCH modes, the capacity cell goes back to the MIMO sleep mode configuration

that is

valid

before entering cell sleep state.

In case the Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode features try to trigger their respective

sleep states at the same time, priority is given to the Cell Sleep Mode feature.

It is recommended that some parameter thresholds of the Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep

Mode features are set to values that are

different

from the default values. The following setup is recommended:

- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownPrbThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute.
- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownRrcConnThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellRrcConnSleepThreshold attribute.

While the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled, the

following setup is recommended:

- The MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is recommended to be set to ADVANCED\_SWITCH.
- The sum of the CellSleepFunction.covCellDlPrbWakeUpThreshold and the CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpDlPrbOffset attribute values is recommended to be greater than the value of the MimoSleepFunction.switchUpPrbThreshold attribute.
- The sum of the CellSleepFunction.covCellRrcConnWakeUpThreshold and the CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpRrcOffset attribute values is recommended to be greater than the value of the MimoSleepFunction.switchUpRrcConnThreshold attribute.

## 9.3 Configuration of Sequential Wake-Up of Capacity Cells

With the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function, the wake-up process of

capacity cells can be customized with MO attribute configurations.

To enable the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function, the following actions must

be taken:

- The CellSleepNodeFunction.seqWakeUpEnabled attribute must be enabled.
- The SleepModeCovProfile MO class must be created.
- The SleepModeCovProfile MO class must be referenced in the CellSleepFunction.covCellProfileRef attribute.

The sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is only supported in deployments in

which there are no cells defined as both capacity and coverage cells.

If the sequential wake-up of capacity cells function is enabled, the following properties

can be configured:

- Wake-up priority of capacity cells
- Wake-up threshold offsets
- Sequential wake-up timer

The SleepModeCovProfile MO class can be used to create a profile of

configured priorities for coverage cells. The MO class contains an instance of the

WakeUpFreqPriority MO class, which can be used to configure

wake-up priority for specified frequencies. Each coverage cell can refer to one instance

of the MO class SleepModeCovProfile, and different coverage cells in

the same node can refer to the same instance, or different instances. If a coverage cell

does not have a reference to any profile, the sequential wake-up of capacity cells

function is not used for that cell.

The following attributes can be set to configure the sequential wake-up of capacity cells

function:

- CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpDlPrbOffset
- CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpIndInstMonitor
- CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpRrcOffset
- CellSleepFunction.covCellProfileRef
- CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpSeqTimer
- CellSleepFunction.wakeUpTrafficCriteria
- WakeUpFreqPriority.eutranFrequencyRef
- WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority

It is recommended to set the same wake-up thresholds for each capacity cell.

To ensure that the wake-up of cells is performed separately, the

CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpSeqTimer attribute is recommended

to be set to a higher value than the value of the

CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpMonitorDurTimer attribute.

To ensure the start of traffic load monitoring on capacity cells without receiving a

trigger from the coverage cell at activation request, the

CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpIndInstMonitor attribute must be

set to true. In this condition if wake-up threshold, offset, or

duration timer value is changed, it does not take effect on ongoing load supervision,

unless the supervision is stopped by changing the

CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpIndInstMonitor attribute to

false, and started again by setting it back to

true.

The configuration requirements for the WakeUpFreqPriority MO

class             created by the

EUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency

or

EUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency

MO action are the following:

- The WakeUpFreqPriority.eutranFrequencyRef attribute must point to the new EUtranFrequency MO instance.
- The WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority attribute must be the same as the WakeUpFreqPriority pointing at the previous EUtranFrequency MO class.

Interfaces

The enhancement of the feature affects the following interface:

- X2 AP New private IE for wake-up cause over X2 Cell Activation Request message is introduced to indicate that the capacity cell wakes up due to a coverage hole.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 17.Q3: CSM: UE Capability Aware

The enhancement enables the consideration of UE capability regarding the frequency band of the coverage cells.

| Feature Name:           | Cell Sleep Mode                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4390 R2                    |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The Cell Sleep Mode (CSM) feature considers UE capability of the frequency band of the coverage

cells. If non-capable UEs have been detected for the configured monitoring duration,

capacity cells do not go to sleep mode. Neighbor cells automatically wake up capacity

cells that are in sleep mode when a non-capable UE needs those cells for coverage

support.

This improvement allows for Cell Sleep Mode to be activated in a wider area on the

network and it ensures that UEs do not lose coverage when Cell Sleep Mode is

activated.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

by automating DST related parameter changes that would require recurring manual

setting.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

During the configuration procedure of the DST settings, the sleep time window needs

to be configured in relation to the relevant standard time. This means that sleep

time needs to be configured in a way

that

it represents standard time expressed in Coordinated Universal

Time (UTC).

New read-only attributes are introduced for the visibility of currently applied start

and end sleep time values. This enables the operator to monitor whether the proper

values are used after configuration.

Capacity cell can enter sleep mode faster if the monitor duration timer is set to

minimal value. The enhancement extends the range of the

CellSleepFunction.capCellSleepMonitorDurTimer attribute to a

minimum of 1.

The

actual time depends on the moving average of the

traffic.

The following parameters are introduced to show high-traffic thresholds and timer

settings for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_CELL\_WAKEUP\_DETECTED event:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_DETECTION\_DL\_PRB\_THRESHOLD\_HIGH

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

The

feature enhancement allows capacity cells higher sleep thresholds and the coverage

cell to wake up capacity cells effectively if traffic

increases.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Energy saving is increased, as the capacity cell can enter sleep state more frequently.
- Sleep request validation can be adjusted to a RAN configuration with a given capacity and coverage layer.
- The coverage cell is able to wake up capacity cells effectively if traffic grows. Because of that, the hysteresis between sleep and wake-up thresholds is decreased.

Capacity and Performance

The sleep time increase can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellSleepTime
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellSleepTime

The changes in energy performance can be observed with the following PM counters:

- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergy
- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated
- EnergyMeter.pmPowerConsumption

Operation

The

following attributes are introduced to adjust the downlink PRB usage and the number

of RRC connections measured  in the traffic offload of the capacity

cell:

- CellSleepFunction.prbOffloadAdjust
- CellSleepFunction.rrcOffloadAdjust

It is recommended not to use adjustments if there are no overlapping coverage cells

within the site or between sites on the capacity layer of the network.

It is not possible to configure different adjustment values for different coverage

cells of the same capacity cell.

The feature enhancement adds the following parameters to the

INTERNAL\_PROC\_CELL\_SLEEP\_TRIGGERED event:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_ADJUST\_DL\_PRB\_OFFLOAD
- EVENT\_PARAM\_ADJUST\_RRC\_OFFLOAD

Interfaces

## Appendix A.g: 22.Q4: Improved Coverage Cell Selection in Sleep Mode

This feature enhancement enables the automatic calculation of the downlink PRB and

RRC offload traffic adjustment.

| Feature Name           | Cell Sleep Mode     |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4390        |

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the automatic adjustment of the measured downlink

PRB usage and the number of RRC connections in the offload traffic. This automatic

adjustment changes dynamically depending on the time of the day or the day of the

week.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

To support the automatic calculation of the PRB and the RRC adjustment, this feature

enhancement adds function to the value 100 of the following

attributes:

- CellSleepFunction.prbOffloadAdjust
- CellSleepFunction.rrcOffloadAdjust

It is not possible to configure different adjustment values for different coverage

cells of the same capacity cell.

If automatic adjustment is configured, handover statistics are valid only if the

capacity cell and the coverage cell are on different frequencies and the

Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature is active on the node. If

handover statistics are invalid, only connected mode priority is used for

calculation.

If the adjustment values are automatically calculated and cell sleep request is sent

to more than one coverage cell, the adjustment values in the

INTERNAL\_PROC\_CELL\_SLEEP\_TRIGGERED event are only shown for

the first coverage cell requested to sleep.

The following factors are considered for automatic calculation:

- The ratio between the number of successful handovers from the capacity cell to the coverage cell and the total number of outgoing handovers
- The connected mode mobility priority of the coverage cell frequency

The maximum value of the automatic adjustment is 80%.

The adjustments must not be used if there are no overlapping capacity cells in the

site or between sites on the capacity layer of the network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Cell Sleep Mode

## Appendix A.h: 23.Q4: Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

This feature enhancement enables MIMO sleep state to activate during cell sleep mode

time windows if conditions for MIMO reduction are met.

| Feature Name           | Cell Sleep Mode     |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4390        |

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to have both Cell Sleep Mode and

MIMO Sleep Mode features activated at the same time. During the cell sleep mode time

window, MIMO sleep detection can be triggered. If the conditions for entering MIMO

sleep mode are met, and cell sleep state is not active during the cell sleep mode

time window, MIMO sleep state can be active.

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can also be active during the cell sleep

mode time window. This extends the time of operation of the LTE AI Powered MIMO

Sleep Mode feature to 24 hours regardless of the time window settings of the Cell

Sleep Mode feature.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- MIMO sleep detection and MIMO sleep state can start during cell sleep mode time window.
- The energy consumption of the radio unit is lowered because of the deactivation of additional antenna branches.

Capacity and Performance

The following PM counters affected by the MIMO Sleep Mode feature might further

increase:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmMimoSleepTime
- EUtranCellTDD.pmMimoSleepTime

The following benefits of the full MIMO configuration are temporarily reduced or

unavailable when MIMO sleep state is active:

- Coverage for low SINR users
- Throughput for low SINR users
- Peak throughput for high SINR users

Operation

The following setting is recommended for thresholds of the Cell Sleep Mode and MIMO

Sleep Mode features:

- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownPrbThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute.
- Set the MimoSleepFunction.switchDownRrcConnThreshold attribute value greater than the value of the CellSleepFunction.capCellRrcConnSleepThreshold attribute.

For the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature to trigger MIMO sleep state during the

cell sleep mode time window, the

CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute is

recommended to be set to less than 10%. The reason for this is the fixed PRB

threshold for the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Enhanced protection from overload in capacity cells through the activation of other sleeping capacity cells when traffic load is increased
- Reduced power consumption through reducing the number of unnecessary capacity cell activations
- Extended configuration options for cell wake-up conditions
- Improved traffic load monitoring

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement increases capacity cell sleep time by making the wake-up

process of capacity cells sequential, which reduces power consumption. The increase

in cell sleep time can be observed through the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellSleepTime
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellSleepTime

This feature enhancement introduces the following events and event parameters:

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_WAKEUP\_IND\_RECEIVED PM event
- EVENT\_PARAM\_IND\_TYPE event parameter for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_WAKEUP\_IND\_RECEIVED PM event
- EVENT\_PARAM\_SEQUENCE\_WAKEUP\_DETECTION\_DL\_PRB\_THRESHOLD event parameter for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_WAKEUP\_IND\_RECEIVED PM event
- EVENT\_PARAM\_SEQUENCE\_WAKEUP\_DETECTION\_UES\_THRESHOLD event parameter for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_WAKEUP\_IND\_RECEIVED PM event
- EVENT\_ARRAY\_CAPACITY\_CELL\_ID event parameter for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_WAKEUP\_IND\_RECEIVED PM event
- EVENT\_PARAM\_WAKEUP\_CAUSE event parameter for the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_CELL\_WAKEUP\_DETECTED PM event

This feature enhancement also modifies the

EVENT\_PARAM\_WAKEUP\_CAUSE event parameter by adding

additional values.

Operation

To enable this feature enhancement, do the following:

- The CellSleepNodeFunction.seqWakeUpEnabled attribute must be set to enabled.
- The SleepModeCovProfile MO class must be created.
- The SleepModeCovProfile MO class must be referenced in the CellSleepFunction.covCellProfileRef attribute.

If it is enabled, instead of waking up all capacity cells when increased traffic load

is detected, a wake-up sequence is used. During the wake-up sequence, capacity cells

are woken up one by one, and the minimum amount of time between two wake-up actions

can be configured. Capacity cells in the same node as the coverage cell also monitor

their own traffic load. When traffic load reaches the threshold, the capacity cell

sends an indication to the coverage cell that wake-up of another capacity cell is

necessary.

This feature enhancement introduces the following MO classes:

- SleepModeCovProfile
- WakeUpFreqPriority

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- CellSleepNodeFunction.seqWakeUpEnabled
- CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpRrcOffset
- CellSleepFunction.capCellWakeUpDlPrbOffset
- CellSleepFunction.covCellProfileRef
- CellSleepFunction.covCellWakeUpSeqTimer
- CellSleepFunction.wakeUpTrafficCriteria
- WakeUpFreqPriority.eutranFrequencyRef
- WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority

This feature enhancement is only applicable if the following requirements are met:

- No cells are defined as both a capacity cell and a coverage cell.
- Capacity cells must be overlapping each other.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
