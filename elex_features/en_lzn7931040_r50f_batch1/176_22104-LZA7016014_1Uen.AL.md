# 1 CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs Overview

The CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs licensed feature allows UE in either

RRC\_CONNECTED or RRC\_IDLE mode to disconnect

its RRC connection from the LTE network to answer or initiate a circuit switched call on

1xRTT.

Summary

With CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs, disconnections no longer appear as radio link failures in

performance management counters. This feature also prevents superfluous paging to UE

that are unavailable because they are handling a speech call on 1xRTT.

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CS Call Setup Time on 1xRTT | This feature increases the circuit switched call setup time on                                     1xRTT for dual-radio UE because the radio connection on LTE must                                     be removed before the 1xRTT call can be setup. Circuit switched                                     call setup time on 1xRTT for dual-radio UE is still faster than                                     single-radio UE because they are already connected to the 1xRTT                                     network. |

# 3 Feature Operation of CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs

Operational Process

Operational

Sequence Diagram for CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs shows a basic

indication of the feature steps.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram for CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs

Step descriptions are presented in Signaling

Flow Chart.

Figure 2   Signaling Flow Chart

When the user decides to make a mobile originating (MO) call or is about to receive a

mobile terminating (MT) call, the following steps occur:

1. The UE is E-UTRAN RRC\_CONNECTED or E-UTRAN RRC\_IDLE and registered with 1xRTT.
2. The user of the UE performs a mobile originating circuit switched call or is about to receive a mobile terminating circuit switched call.
3. The UE sends an extended service request to the MME over NAS (passing transparently through the eNodeB).
4. The MME sends a S1 UE Context Modification indicating circuit switched fallback required. If the UE is in RRC\_IDLE state, the MME sends an S1 UE Context Setup Request message indicating circuit switched fallback required.
5. The E-UTRAN sends an S1 UE Context Modification Response. If the UE is in RRC\_IDLE state, the E-UTRAN sends an S1 UE Context Setup Response message.
6. E-UTRAN performs an RRC Connection Release.
7. An S1 UE Context Release Request is sent to MME.
8. MME suspends all bearers for the UE
9. MME sends a UE Context Release to the E-UTRAN.
10. The 1xRTT mobile originating or mobile terminating call is established.

Once the feature is enabled, SIB8 messages containing the

csfb-SupportForLimitedDualRadioUEs parameter sent to the

UE.

The UE indicates its Dual-Radio capabilities to the eNodeB by setting the

rx-Config1XRTT IE of the cdma2000-1xRTT IE to

dual.

# 4 Network Impact of CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs

This feature has impact on capacity and performance.

Capacity and Performance

This feature provides a small increase in radio capacity by clearing wasted LTE radio

resources of dual-mode UE that engages in circuit switched calls on the 1xRTT

network. Dual-Band UE on circuit switched calls in 1xRTT networks is not paged by

the LTE network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs

This feature has no introduced, affected or affecting parameters.

# 6 Performance of CS Fallback for Dual-Radio UEs

The feature reduces the drop call rate for Dual-Radio UEs.
