# 1 Differentiated UE Handling Overview

The Differentiated UE Handling feature introduces a device handling framework in the

eNodeB. This framework enables the operator to treat UEs differently based on device

type.

Summary

The MME provides the eNodeB with the Masked IMEISV using the S1AP. A neighbor eNodeB can use

the X2AP. The following device type information is parsed from the IMEISV:

- Type Allocation Code
- Masked Serial Number
- Software Version Number

This feature prepares the framework to configure the differentiated handling of UEs and

defines product changes for applying the desired configuration.

As part of the Differentiated UE Handing feature, certain features can be specifically turned

off for certain UE models, and turned on for other UE models. This functionality is

configured by the operator in the eNodeB.

The feature also includes the possibility to configure different DRX settings for UEs with

certain IMEISVs. DRX is introduced by the Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE feature. The Service Specific DRX feature makes it possible to

configure different DRX parameter settings for different UE services. Some UE models

can have problems with specific DRX settings. These problems require expensive and

complex workarounds. The Differentiated UE Handling feature overrides DRX parameters

set by the features above. IMEISV can now be used as a criterion for differentiated

handling for these UE models.

The differentiated DRX settings are only applied to UEs when feature Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE is active.

Observability of UE behavior based on UE model is implemented by using PM events where Type

Allocation Code, SVN, and Masked Serial Number are included as event parameters.

By different handling of UEs based on their model type, this feature can improve user

experience as well as network efficiency. Known incompatibilities with certain UE

models can be handled as well as consequent faults and problems mitigated.

The benefit of selectively turning off a certain feature for certain IMEISVs is that the

features can be activated in the eNodeB. This avoids the negative consequences of

applying the feature to UEs that have incorrect software.

By configuring different DRX settings for each IMEISV, the configuration of the settings for

problematic UEs is simplified. The IMEISV is used to differentiate UEs, which allows

features such as Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE to operate

problem-free in the network.

This feature makes it possible to log the Masked IMEISV for network troubleshooting purposes

and to check what UE types and UE models are currently active in the network. The

IMEISV is logged in the existing PM events.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

- The core network (MME) that handles the eNodeB where the UE is connected must support at least Release 12 of 3GPP TS 36.413 and be able to send Masked IMEISV to the eNodeB.
- The neighbor eNodeB must support at least Release 12 of 3GPP TS 36.423 and be able to send Masked IMEISV.

System Functions

This feature affects no system functions.

# 3 Feature Operation of Differentiated UE Handling

The Differentiated UE Handling feature prepares the framework to configure the

differentiated handling of UEs and defines product changes to apply the desired

configuration.

The feature has the following functions:

- Turning off the following features for each UE model type: Carrier Aggregation Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover SRVCC Handover to UTRAN SRVCC Handover to GERAN TTI Bundling Uplink Carrier Aggregation
- Configuring IMEISV-specific DRX profiles which override DRX settings defined by other features. Note: The feature Efficient DRX/DTX for Connected UE must be active.

This framework makes the following functions possible:

- Turning off other features based on IMEISV.
- Selectively turning on features based on IMEISV.
- Using differentiated parameter setting for UE through IMEISV.

Handling of Masked IMEISV

MME sends Masked IMEISV at Connection Setup or at S1 Handover and it is stored in the

eNodeB. In case of X2 Handover or Connection Reestablishment in target eNodeB, the source

eNodeB is responsible to send previously stored Masked IMEISV.

For proper feature operation, all involved nodes in the network must be capable of storing

and sending Masked IMEISV.

IMEISV Database

The operator configurable IMEISV database contains one instance of

ImeisvTable and a maximum of 150 instances of

ImeisvProfile. Each profile contains:

- A list of maximum 20 quintuples of the struct members of struct TacSvAndSnRange
- A list of maximum 15 features to be switched off for the related UEs.Note: The eNodeB supports to switch off only 10 features of the 15 different features in the list.
- Specified DRX profiles to apply to the UEs. Note: If the UE uses QCI 65, QCI 66, QCI 69, or QCI 70, the ImeisvProfile.nonVoiceDrxProfileRef is used. It is recommended to configure ImeisvProfile.nonVoiceDrxProfileRef to use the mission-critical PTT DRX profile.

The Type Allocation Code value and range of Serial Number and SVN must be unique in all

ImeisvProfile instances. It is not allowed to set two TacSvAndSnRange structs with the same Type

Allocation Code and overlapping Serial Number or SVN ranges.

Operation Sequence Diagram

This feature relies on Masked IMEISV sent to eNodeB in following messages:

- S1AP Initial Context Setup Request
- S1AP Handover Request
- X2AP Handover Request
- Ericsson X2AP EAB UE Context Fetch Response
- X2AP Retrieve UE Context Response

The IMEISV that uniquely identifies the UE is composed as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   IMEISV Composition (from 3GPP TS 23.003)

Masked IMEISV is the IMEISV with last 4 digits of Serial Number set to "0xF", thereby

making it impossible to identify the corresponding user.

Figures 2-6 illustrate the high level sequence of handling Masked IMEISV at Connection

Establishment, Handover and Re-establishment.

# 4 Network Impact of Differentiated UE Handling

The Differentiated UE Handling feature has an impact on capacity and mobility depending

on the configuration.

Capacity and Performance

The feature Differentiated UE Handling can be configured to switch off the TTI Bundling feature for UEs that have problems with it. The

operator can still activate the feature, and yet not get any negative impact from wrong

behavior of such UEs.

If the feature is configured to modify DRX settings, it impacts the UE throughput. DRX

increases UE battery savings but results in a degradation of the system performance. This

must be balanced in the best way by the configuration.

The feature can have an impact on mobility by configuring to switch off the following

features for specified UEs:

- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover
- SRVCC Handover to UTRAN
- SRVCC Handover to GERAN

The Handover Success Rate can increase because the UEs that has problems with that kind of

handover do not attempt the handover.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

- The neighbor eNodeB must support at least Release-12 of 3GPP TS 36.423 and be able to send Masked IMEISV.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance, depending on node type: Node Type License Control MO DU Radio Node OptionalFeatureLicense=DifferentiatedUeHandling Baseband Radio Node FeatureState=CXC4011951

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Differentiated UE Handling

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the applicable MO instance, depending on node type: Node Type License Control MO DU Radio Node OptionalFeatureLicense=DifferentiatedUeHandling Baseband Radio Node FeatureState=CXC4011951

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q2: Differentiated UE handling for Carrier Aggregation

This enhancement makes it possible for the operator to disable Carrier Aggregation for specific UE types based on their IMEISV.

| Feature Name:           | Differentiated UE Handling         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4368 R2                    |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | 801 0400 R11                       |
| Node Type:              | DU Radio Node, Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement to the Differentiated UE Handling feature makes it possible for the operator

to disable Carrier Aggregation for specific UE types based on their IMEISV. This way,

known Carrier Aggregation incompatibilities with certain UE models can be better

handled, faults and problems can be mitigated by blacklisting those UEs. As a

consequence, there are fewer dropped connections.

Capacity and Performance

When increasing the number of ImeisvProfile instances defined in the MOM, a

decrease in performance can be expected . Up to 150 IMEISV profiles are supported in

the MOM.

Operation

Modifications in the following MO class are required:

- ImeisvProfile

Extend the existing enum FeatureName with "Feature Carrier Aggregation"

used in the  ImeisvProfile.listOfFeaturesToTurnOff attribute.

It has to be ensured that pegging

EUtranCellFDD.pmInhibitImeisvFeature or

EUtranCellTDD.pmInhibitImeisvFeature works in the

corresponding bin for Carrier Aggregation.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 22.Q1: Differentiated UE Handling for Uplink Carrier Aggregation

The feature enhancement can turn off the Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature for

specific UE types without affecting the operation of other UEs.

| Feature Name:           | Differentiated UE Handling   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4368                 |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                          |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the operator to turn off the configuration of the

Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature for selected UE types based on masked

IMEISV.

The UE types that are not affected by the feature enhancement can use the Uplink

Carrier Aggregation feature without any additional restriction.

The feature enhancement decreases the call drop rate for the affected UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The improvement of the call drop rate can be observed with the Differentiated E-RAB

Retainability - Percentage Lost KPI.

The observability is improved so that the affected UEs can be tracked.

Pegging the EUtranCellFDD.pmInhibitImeisvFeature or the

EUtranCellTDD.pmInhibitImeisvFeature counter must be ensured

to work in the corresponding bin for the Uplink Carrier Aggregation feature.

Operation

This feature enhancement extends the operation of the Differentiated UE Handling

feature by including the Uplink Carrier  Aggregation feature name in the list of the

ImeisvProfile.listOfFeaturesToTurnOff attribute.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
