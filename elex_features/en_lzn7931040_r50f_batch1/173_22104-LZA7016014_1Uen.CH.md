| Inter-Frequency Load Balancing (FAJ                                     121 3009)                   | Prerequisite   | To use the Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature, the                                     Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature must be active. The                                     Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature affects how                                     Inter-Frequency Load Balancing selects UEs for a load-balancing                                     action.     When uplink-heavy UE detection and exclusion are active in a                                     cell, the UE might be moved to a neighbor cell before it is                                     identified as uplink-heavy. If it is detected as uplink-heavy in                                     the serving cell it was moved to, it might be immediately moved                                     back to the source cell. After the last handover, the UE is                                     identified as uplink-heavy and is not chosen for further                                     load-balancing actions as long as it is marked as                                     uplink-heavy. |

# 3 Feature Operation of Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB

The purpose of the Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature is to improve load balancing

by taking the carrier aggregation capability of the UEs into account.

Operational

Process

The

Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature evaluates the UE for CATR and adds conditions for UE

evaluation for load

balancing.

Evaluating the UE for CATR happens during the Initial Context Setup procedure. This

procedure measures the carrier aggregation use potential of the UE in the source cell and

the available load balancing in the target cells. If a better target cell is found, the UE

is configured to measure the corresponding frequency.

The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature adds conditions to the Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing UE selection evaluations to choose a certain UE for load balancing. The purpose of

these added conditions is to make sure that a carrier aggregation-capable UE is only subject

to load balancing if a target cell with better aggregated subscription capacity is found.

Figure 1   Principal UE Movement Due to Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and Carrier

Aggregation-Aware IFLB

Process Steps

1. The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB orders the carrier aggregation-capable UEs to hand over after initial context setup.
2. The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB balances load by handing over the carrier aggregation-capable UEs to the cells where carrier aggregation can be used. Load balancing is possible in both directions between all cells, but Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB is only useful if the carrier aggregation use potential for the UE increases.

Engineering Guidelines for Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB

Carrier Aggregation Triggered Redirection Operation

## 3.1 Carrier Aggregation Triggered Redirection Operation

Process Steps

The cell evaluation process is performed at initial context setup.

The feature performs

the following

steps

to find a desired target cell:

1. If the EUtranFreqRelation.caTriggeredRedirectionActive parameter of the current cell is set to true, CATR is possible towards a certain frequency. These frequencies are selected for CATR by the feature.
2. For these frequencies, all cells are selected that fulfill the following conditions:
    - The carrier target cell subscription ratio is lower than the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaThreshold value.
    - The difference between the target cell subscription ratio and the source cell subscription ratio is lower than the value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbDiffCaOffset attribute. This means that the value of the target cell can exceed the source cell value by the LoadBalancingFunction.lbDiffCaOffset value.
    - All remaining cells are evaluated for best carrier aggregation combination. A target cell is only qualified if the aggregated subscription capacity is better by the value of LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaCapHysteresis than the aggregated subscription capacity for the source cell. Note: Intra-cell handover to additional band is an enhancement to the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature. When MFBI is active, the evaluation considers the possibility to move UEs to the additional band.
    - The EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute of the desired cell relations is set to ALLOWED or IFO\_AND\_IFLB. This means that the cell is available for load balancing.
3. The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB selects the frequency for the best target cell and orders the UE to start A5 measurement for that frequency. Measurement configuration is included in the first RRC connection reconfiguration message sent to the UE.
4. Handover is triggered if the UE responds with a measurement report and the reported cell still fulfills the required conditions.

Example 1   High-Level Example of Evaluations Performed by

CATR

Figure 2   High-Level Example of Evaluations Performed by CATR

1. The Carrier target cell subscription ratio is lower than the value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaThreshold attribute. This excludes target cell T1 as a candidate for CATR, because load is higher than the value of LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaThreshold.
2. The difference between the target cell subscription ratio and the source cell subscription ratio is lower than the value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbDiffCaOffset attribute. This means that the value of the target cell can exceed the source cell value by the LoadBalancingFunction.lbDiffCaOffset value. This excludes target cell T2 as a candidate for CATR, because the load difference is too high.
3. All remaining cells are evaluated for the best carrier aggregation combination. A target cell is only qualified if the aggregated subscription capacity is better by the value of LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaCapHysteresis than the aggregated subscription capacity for the source cell. This excludes T3 as a candidate for CATR, because the carrier aggregation capacity is lower than the source and the hysteresis values combined.

## 3.2 Process Steps for Load Balancing UE Selection

In addition to the

criteria for

UE selection in the load balancing UE selection process, there are additional steps performed

for carrier aggregation-capable UEs.

Process Steps

1. For a carrier aggregation-capable UE to be selected for load balancing action, at least one of the following criteria must be fulfilled:
    - The subscription ratio in the source cell is higher than the value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaThreshold attribute added to the value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaHysteresis attribute.
    - The LoadBalancingFunction.lbDiffCaOffset attribute together with the load difference between the source and target cell is higher than the LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaHysteresis attribute.
    - The aggregated capacity of the target cell increased by the value of LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaCapHysteresis is greater than the aggregated capacity of the source cell.
2. Handover is triggered if the UE responds with a measurement report and the reported cell still fulfills the required conditions.Note: When uplink-heavy UE detection for the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is configured, UEs can be excluded from load-balancing mobility actions based on their uplink-heavy state. For further description of the UE selection procedure, see Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

# 4 Network Impact of Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB

This feature

increases the RRC signaling related to inter-frequency measurements and handovers and the

number of inter-frequency handovers.

Capacity and Performance

The Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature distributes the

UEs

to achieve good use of the

carrier

aggregation.

The feature relies on UE inter-frequency measurements to identify UEs suitable for

redirection,

and it redistributes users in connected mode between cells by inter-frequency

handover.

These mean that

the

RRC signaling associated with inter-frequency measurements and

handovers,

and the number of the inter-frequency handovers can

increase.

These

measurements are initiated by the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing, Inter-Frequency Offload, Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA, and Carrier

Aggregation-Aware IFLB features.

Interfaces

No impact is expected from this feature.

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB

To evaluate the

best use of carrier aggregation for a UE, the aggregated capacity of the PCell and one or

more SCells is calculated for source and candidate target

cells.

The LoadBalancingFunction.lbCaCapHysteresis attribute is used to

qualify target cells so that they offer a clear benefit over the source cell in terms of

aggregated capacity.

If the source or target PCells have an ESCell, the cell subscription capacity of the

ESCell can be scaled down with the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling attribute. The

attribute is used to decrease carrier aggregation attraction of an ESCell belonging to

an indicated eNodeB.

The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute is

configured by the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature or Elastic RAN feature and is

used for indicating the state of an ESCell. To identify the available ESCell, the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute must be

set to one of the following values:

For more information, see Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation and Elastic RAN documents.

If the Load-Based CA SCell Handling and Carrier

Aggregation-Aware IFLB features are activated simultaneously, the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling is

affected by the Load-Based CA SCell Handling feature operation. When

ExternalEUtranCellFDD.caLockDueToHighLoad

is true, the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling

attribute changes to 0. If the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eSCellCapacityScaling has

a value of 0, the cell is not considered to be configured

as a CA SCell.

For more information, see Load-Based CA SCell Handling.

Capacity

Figure 3   Calculate the Aggregated Subscription Capacity

The purpose of the aggregated subscription capacity calculation is to find the

target cell that offers the best aggregated subscription capacity for the UE. To do

so, network configuration is matched with the CA capabilities of the UE.

The

aggregated subscription capacity is calculated based on the available PCell-SCell

combinations, where the following conditions are true:

- Two possible carrier aggregation combinations use the source cell as PCell and can be chosen by the UE.
- The UE does not support any carrier aggregation band combination that includes frequency F4. Therefore no valid carrier aggregation combinations exist with cells on F4.
- The UE is handed over to target cell A if caCapA, 2 yields the highest aggregated subscription capacity. This occurs through CATR or LB.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: Improved Carrier Aggregation Triggered Redirection

This enhancement enables the Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature to support

Release 13 and Release 14 UE capability IEs in RRC messages. As a result, CATR is available

for UEs capable of configuration of any number of component carriers.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3075                     |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation     |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0564                     |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node              |
| Access Type:            | LTE                              |

Benefits

This enhancement enables CATR algorithms to use data from 3GPP Release 13 and Release

14 carrier aggregation band combination capability IEs. This data is received in the

UE Capability Information RRC message from UEs at initial RRC

connection setup. This way UEs that support Release 13 or Release 14 can be

distributed with the CATR function. The enhancement has the following benefits:

- More UEs are selected for CATR measurements.
- The number of CATR handovers increases.
- The resource sharing between the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB features is optimized.
- The better distribution of the UE population results in better use of the carrier aggregation function.

Capacity and Performance

The RRC signaling associated with inter-frequency measurements and handovers can

increase. The number of measurements and handovers for IFLB decreases, as more UEs

are handled with CATR.

The benefits of the enhancement can be observed through the increase of the following

PM counters:

- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAttLteInterFCaRedirect
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSuccLteInterFCaRedirect
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExecAttLteInterFCaRedirect
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExecSuccLteInterFCaRedirect
