Summary

The feature introduces support for the MME Overload Control procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.401.

The signalling load on MMEs that have sent 'Overload Start'

message to the eNodeB is reduced to protect them from the overload state. This is the main

benefit of the feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

The counters related to the MME Overload Control feature are different for each cell

in the RBS. For more information about the counters related to this feature, see the

Counters in Performance of MME Overload Control.

The MME Overload Control feature involves the S1 network interface. The S1 Interface

connects the RBS to the MME for control plane data. This interface is used for

sending Overload Start and Overload Stop messages

between the nodes.

# 3 Feature Operation of MME Overload Control

MME Overload Control reduces the signaling load on MMEs that send an Overload

Start message to the eNodeB to protect them from the overload

state.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Feature Functionality of MME Overload Control

When an eNodeB receives the Overload Start message, the eNodeB

selectively rejects RRC connection requests for UEs. The UEs are served by the

overloaded MME, identified by the s-TMSI value, and based on the establishment cause

of the request.

Depending on the following data received in the Overload Start

message, the eNodeB rejects either:

- All RRC connection requests with establishment cause Mobile Originating (MO) data.
- All RRC connection requests with establishment cause MO data and MO signaling.

Additionally, MMEs that are reported an overloaded state are disregarded in the MME

selection algorithm to reduce the load on a further overloaded MME.

The UEs that send RRC connection requests without an s-TMSI, are released after

reception of RRC connection setup complete. Such event occurs if the registered MME

for the UEs is in the overloaded state. When overloaded UEs start a new RRC

connection attempt, they no longer have a registered MME defined and the MME

selection algorithm can select an MME that is not in the overloaded state.

When an eNodeB receives the message Overload Stop, the MME is no

longer considered overloaded by the eNodeB.

# 4 Network Impact of MME Overload Control

MME Overload Control feature affects the capacity and performance.

Capacity and Performance

The feature affects network accessibility for UEs served by MMEs in the overloaded

state. This is not visible in the accessibility KPIs that measure Ericsson eNodeB

performance. However, the reduced accessibility is visible for the operator by the

counters introduced for this feature, see Performance of MME Overload Control for

details.

The feature increases the number of rejected UEs while MMEs are in overload state. It

can trigger the Load-Based Access Barring and Progressive Access Barring features.

Because of the increased number of rejected RRC connection requests and the

reattempts of the UEs, the feature also introduces higher load on the random access

channel while MMEs are in the overload state.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
