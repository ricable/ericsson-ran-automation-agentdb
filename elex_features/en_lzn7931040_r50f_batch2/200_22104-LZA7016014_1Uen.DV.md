Summary

CRSs are normally transmitted across the entire bandwidth, even if there is no

traffic in the system. CRSs generate interference towards neighboring cells on the

same frequency. The CRS-induced interference is a dominating factor in limiting the

downlink throughput, specifically for higher-order modulation.

The feature sends CRSs only where and when they are needed to support the traffic in

the system, minimizing the interference. CRSs in the configured measurement

bandwidth, that is the central six PRBs, are always transmitted. It secures that the

stability of intra-frequency and inter-frequency RSRP measurements is maintained. In

addition, CRSs are sent across the full bandwidth when the UE needs to read the full

carrier. The feature can tune the number of subframes with full CRS bandwidth to

cater for different UE behaviors. It can also send CRSs only to specific narrowbands

for Category M1 UEs.

In TDD, the feature only supports uplink or downlink configuration 2, with the

following special subframe configurations:

- 5
- 6
- 7

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Improved end-user performance.
- Improved cell capacity.
- Extension to outdoor macro environments by facilitating the use of 256-QAM Downlink.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

It is recommended to enable Scheduling Request Suppression function for Ericsson Lean

Carrier VoLTE.

Maximum paging capacity is reduced because of the restricted value setting of the

Paging.nB attribute.

UEs are not allowed to lose uplink synchronization because of the restricted value

setting of the EUtranCellFDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer or the EUtranCellTDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer attribute.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Ericsson Lean Carrier

The feature controls the transmission of CRSs, minimizing the interference caused by

the CRSs.

The CRSs are transmitted across the entire bandwidth of a cell, even when there is no

traffic in the cell. The CRSs contribute to interference towards neighboring cells on

the same frequency, which limits the downlink performance.

With this feature, the CRSs are transmitted when the UEs expect them to be present. When

the UEs do not expect them to be present, the CRSs are muted.

The feature is not covered by the 3GPP specification, so activating it might affect some

UE types. For example, idle mode access in poor radio conditions might be affected for

some UE types. To assess potential effect, it is recommended to evaluate the UE

performance in laboratory environment with activated and deactivated Ericsson Lean

Carrier feature.

The eNodeB uses DRX to align on-durations between

UEs to

increase the CRS muting opportunities. The CRS muting opportunities also increase when

the load in a cell is low.

To maintain a working idle mode cell mobility behavior, it is important that RSRP and

RSRQ measurements performed by the UEs are not affected by this feature. This is

achieved by transmitting CRSs at paging occasions and subframes where system information

is transmitted.

To maintain stable RSRP measurements from UEs that are connected to an Ericsson Lean

Carrier enabled cell, CRSs are transmitted at, and near the

onDuration of the DRX pattern.

When the feature is active, the feature-specific DRX settings override any Service

Specific DRX settings. If the operator configures specific DRX settings for a given UE

with the Differentiated UE Handling feature, it overrides the

Ericsson Lean Carrier-specific DRX settings for the same UE.

The DrxProfile.shortDrxCycle attribute is inactive in Ericsson Lean

Carrier DRX pattern. If the Ericsson Lean Carrier 320 ms DRX function is enabled, the

Ericsson Lean Carrier 320 ms DRX profile is used. Ericsson Lean Carrier 320 ms DRX

function can be enabled for a specific range of UEs by configuring their masked IMEI

range, or for all UEs in a cell. If the Ericsson Lean Carrier Interoperability with

VoLTE function is used, the Ericsson Lean Carrier VoLTE DRX profile applies when the

VoLTE bearer is set up.

If a PTT bearer is set up, and the

EricssonLeanCarrierFunction.disableElcOnPtt is set to

true, the feature is disabled. This is the recommended

configuration for PTT service.

The link adaptation for PDSCH ensures that the most appropriate MCS is allocated for the

UE. In Ericsson Lean Carrier cases, the link adaptation is enhanced based on the CRS

muting characteristics to allocate more appropriate MCSs to UEs.

The Ericsson Lean Carrier Blacklisting UEs function enables the operator to configure the

feature off for UEs incompatible with the feature.

For Cat-M1 UEs the CRSs are transmitted on the applicable narrowbands instead of the

whole bandwidth.

## 3.1 Test UE Compliance with Ericsson Lean Carrier

The purpose of the UE compliance test is to detect possible incompatibilities between

the feature and specific UEs before the feature is turned on in a live network.

Whether a UE is compatible with the feature can be determined by recording and evaluating

its reported RSRP values. Ericsson can offer assistance in device selection for further

compliance testing.

Required Tools and Equipment

- A logging tool is available.

Steps

1. Set up the test environment consisting of the tested UE and a cell.
2. Make sure that the UE is in idle mode and that the logging tool is attached to it.
3. Perform the RSRP logging.
    1. Start logging.
    2. Wait 10 seconds to capture UE behavior during idle mode.
    3. Initiate full buffer downlink traffic measurement for 20 seconds.
    4. Keep logging for at least 20 seconds after the data transmission is over.
    5. Stop logging.
4. Plot the RSRP over time.
5. Compare the differences of average RSRP values between any of the following states: Idle mode Connected mode with data Connected mode without data

Results

If all average RSRP values are within 2 dB to each other, the UE is compliant with the

feature.

# 4 Network Impact of Ericsson Lean Carrier

Because of the non-standard nature of the solution, the stability of network KPIs

depends on both the network parameter settings and the UE device fleet.

Capacity and Performance

The feature operates most efficiently when the cell load is low. When there are many

connected users in a cell, and the TTI use is high, the benefit of using the feature is

low.

The feature is active during low load only. It has no effect on KPIs at high load, even if

the feature is enabled. Once the load decreases in the cell, the operation of the feature is

restored automatically.

For FDD, the ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment MO parameter is

recommended to be set to TRUE to improve the benefits of the feature.

With many Ericsson Lean Carrier 320 ms DRX UEs configured, the cell throughput might

decrease depending on the arrival traffic model. The packet delay of 320 ms DRX UEs

increases more than Ericsson Lean Carrier 40 ms DRX UEs.

With Ericsson Lean Carrier Blacklisting UEs function configured, the benefits of using the

feature in the cell decrease depending on the following:

- Whether a blacklisting UE is connected in the cell.
- How long the blacklisting UE remains connected in the cell.

With the Ericsson Lean Carrier Interoperability with VoLTE function, the following can be

supported while still achieving Ericsson Lean Carrier gain:

- Up to 32 VoLTE users in FDD.
- Up to 16 VoLTE users in TDD.

When the separate downlink or uplink BLER target function is enabled, there is gain in

VoLTE quality (packet loss, BLER). In the case of mixed VoLTE and MBB call in the same UE,

the peak throughput is affected because of the lower BLER target.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

T1_8 is also acceptable but provides slightly lower                   feature gain, because of an increase in paging subframes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Rcs.tInactivityTimer                                    | Affected   | For Ericsson Lean Carrier configured UEs, a value in the Ericsson Lean Carrier                   affects the Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute. This value is                   controlled by an Ericsson internal parameter. The Ericsson Lean Carrier overrides                   the Rcs.tInactivityTimer if the value in the Ericsson Lean                   Carrier is higher than 0 s and lower than the value of                     Rcs.tInactivityTimer. If the value in the Ericsson Lean                   Carrier is set to 0 s, then the Rcs.tInactivityTimer is                   used. |
| ReportConfigEUtraBestCell.a3offset                      | Affected   | Value is recommended to be ≥ 3 dB.  High A3 measurement values reduce the risk of oscillating handovers.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Ericsson Lean Carrier

The feature gives significant gains only on specific cell bandwidths.

Prerequisite Value of CQI Periodicity

When this feature is activated, the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.commonCqiPeriodicity or the

EUtranCellTDD.commonCqiPeriodicity attribute must be set to the

default 80 ms.

Recommended Cell Bandwidths

The feature is only expected to give significant gains on the following cell

bandwidths:

- 10 MHz
- 15 MHz
- 20 MHz

The feature is not recommended to be activated for bandwidths 1.4 MHz and 3 MHz.

Recommended Setting of

ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment

For FDD, the ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment MO

parameter is recommended to be set to TRUE to improve Ericsson Lean

Carrier gain.

## 9.1 Paging Parameters for Ericsson Lean Carrier

Set the Paging.nB and the

Paging.maxNoOfPagingRecords attributes to minimize the paging

occasions.

The Engineering Guidelines for Ericsson Lean Carrier contains

the recommended combinations of cell bandwidth and Paging.nB values,

what gives the maximum eNodeB paging capacity in pages for each second. It is the

narrowest bandwidth cell that sets the limit for how many paging records can be

multiplexed.

The row selection should be made based on the smallest available cell bandwidth in the

eNodeB. The column selection should be made based on the required paging capacity in the

eNodeB.

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q4: Category M and Ericsson Lean Carrier Coexistence

This enhancement allows the Category M Access and the Ericsson Lean Carrier features

to coexist.

| Feature Name:           | Category M Access, Ericsson Lean Carrier             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4658, FAJ 121 4471                           |
| Value Package Name:     | M-IoT RAN on LTE Base Package, Ericsson Lean Carrier |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1000, FAJ 801 0567                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                  |
| Access Type:            | MI, LTE                                              |

Benefits

The enhancement provides the following benefits:

- The Category M Access and Ericsson Lean Carrier features can coexist.
- For Category M1 UEs, the CRSs are transmitted on the applicable narrow bands instead of the entire bandwidth.

Capacity and Performance

When the Category M Access feature is activated, the total Ericsson Lean Carrier gain

of the cell is slightly reduced.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 17.Q3: Ericsson Lean Carrier Interoperability with VoLTE

The Ericsson Lean Carrier Interoperability with VoLTE function provides optimization of

functions, such as quality improvement, battery saving.

The Ericsson Lean Carrier Interoperability with VoLTE function optimizes the following:

- Support up to 32 FDD VoLTE UEs or 16 TDD VoLTE UEs with Ericsson Lean Carrier gain.
- Increase OnDurationTimer for FDD (VoLTE UEs only).
- Reduce DrxInactivityTimer for FDD and TDD in case of VoLTE UEs.
- 40 ms LongDrxCycle and synchronized DRX offset.
- Separate BLER Target for VoLTE and Data. BLER Target in UL for VoLTE supported in legacy BLER Target in DL for VoLTE
- DBS/SABE and Battery saving Scheduling from 20 ms to 40 ms by DBS Scheduling Request Suppression ON (recommended)

The changes are supported for both FDD and TDD.

Capacity and Performance

With the new Ericsson Lean Carrier VoLTE DRX profiles introduced by the Ericsson Lean Carrier

Interoperability with VoLTE function, the Ericsson Lean Carrier VoLTE quality

improves compared to legacy Ericsson Lean Carrier. With the separate DL BLER target

function enabled, a lower DL BLER target is applied when VoLTE bearer is set up. In

the case of mixed VoLTE and MBB call in the same UE, the peak throughput is affected

because of the lower BLER target.

Operation

It is recommended to enable Scheduling Request Suppression function for Ericsson Lean Carrier

VoLTE.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- OSS O17B/ENM17B version is required.
- UE To use the Scheduling Request Suppression function, the UE needs to be Rel 9 or later and with FGI bit 29 (Semi-Persistent Scheduling) set to 1.

## Appendix A.c: 17.Q3: Ericsson Lean Carrier: Carrier Aggregation Interworking

The feature adds the capability to transmit CRSs when the CA activated UE is located in

the Ericsson Lean Carrier cell.

If in the SCell of a CA activated UE there is a short period when there is no data transmitted

to the CA activated UE in the SCell, the CRSs are muted in the SCell during that period.

This function adds the capability to transmit CRSs when the CA activated UE is located

in the Ericsson Lean Carrier cell to maintain stable RSRP measurements from the UE

during CA activated period.

Capacity and Performance

There can be slight Ericsson Lean Carrier gain loss, for example DL Tput decrease, in the

intra-frequency neighboring cells of the SCell because the SCell unmutes more CRSs.

The pmElcPdschBlankedTti pmCounter in the SCell decreases, but

the RSRP fluctuation of the Ericsson Lean Carrier UE during the CA activated period

is solved.

This slight Ericsson Lean Carrier gain loss can only be perceived in low traffic cases, where

there is only intermittent CA traffic. It is not perceived in stable high CA traffic

because in that case Ericsson Lean Carrier is not muted.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

## Appendix A.d: 17.Q3: Ericsson Lean Carrier 320ms DRX and Blacklisting of UEs

The enhancement enables the configuration of a longer DRX cycle and also introduces

the Blacklisting function.

The Ericsson Lean Carrier 320ms DRX function allows operators to configure a longer DRX

cycle for specific Ericsson Lean Carrier UEs, based on configured IMEI range, or for all

UEs of the cell. A longer DRX cycle saves UE battery power.

The Blacklisting function allows operators to configure Ericsson Lean

Carrier-incompatible UEs as blacklisted, based on their masked-IMEI range. When

blacklisted UEs are connected, Ericsson Lean Carrier temporarily switches off in the

cell, which ensures the Ericsson Lean Carrier-incompatible UEs performance.

These changes are supported for both FDD and TDD.

Capacity and Performance

With lots of Ericsson Lean Carrier 320ms DRX UEs configured, the cell throughput

might decrease depending on the arrival traffic model. The packet delay of 320 ms

DRX UEs increases slightly more than Ericsson Lean Carrier 40ms DRX UEs.

With blacklisting UEs configured, the Ericsson Lean Carrier gain of the cell

decreases depending on whether a blacklisting UE is connected in the cell, and how

long it is connecting in the cell.

Operation

The license for the Ericsson Lean Carrier feature must be installed.

The elcEnabled parameter must be set to true in

the EUtranCellFDD or the EUtranCellTDD MO

class.

The available feature activation options for Ericsson Lean Carrier 320ms DRX are the following:

- Set the elc320msDrxEnabled parameter in the ImeisvProfile MO class to true. Note: The license for the Differentiated UE Handling feature must be installed.
- Or set the elcLongDrxCycle attribute in the EUtranCellFDD or the EUtranCellTDD MO class to SF320.Note: The cell level 320ms DRX setting has a higher priority than IMEI-based 320ms DRX configuration.

For blacklisting of UEs, the listOfFeaturesToTurnOff parameter in

the ImeisvProfile MO class must have enum value 4, which

indicates that the Ericsson Lean Carrier and the Differentiated UE Handling features must be

activated.

Interfaces

With the introduction of 320 ms long DRX cycle,

longDRX-CycleStartOffset in RRC is changed.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

When the Differentiated UE Handling feature is required to be

activated, the core network (MME) and the neighbor eNodeB should follow the network

requirements of Differentiated UE Handling feature.

## Appendix A.e: 18.Q2: Ericsson Lean Carrier Enhancement
