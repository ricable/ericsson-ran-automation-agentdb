Summary

The eNodeB measures the UE uplink transmission to estimate the downlink channel condition. The

estimation assumes channel reciprocity because TDD uses the same frequency for

uplink and downlink. The eNodeB forms the beam towards the intended UE using the

correlation in the spatial domain between the antennas to enhance the signal

strength. Thus, the users with bad channel conditions on the edge of the cell can

have an improved throughput.

This feature improves coverage and capacity for all TDD cells.

Hardware

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

The cell is initially setup with a cell covering beam pattern

for the common channels to all UEs. The cell covering beam pattern is also used for 3GPP

transmission mode 3 (TM3). Common channel beamforming introduces the following MOM

parameters to select the initial beamforming weights for all downlink channels:

- AntennaSubunit.azimuthHalfPowerBeamwidth
- AntennaSubunit.commonChBeamfrmPortMap
- AntennaSubunit.customComChBeamfrmWtsAmplitude
- AntennaSubunit.customComChBeamfrmWtsPhase

The AntennaSubunit.azimuthHalfPowerBeamwidth  and the

AntennaSubunit.commonChBeamfrmPortMap parameters allow the user

to configure cross-polarized antennas with 65 and 90 degree half-power beamwidth, and

co-polarized antennas with 65 and 90 degree half-power beamwidth.

Radio calibration capability is required in the uplink and downlink. Calibration of

radios and antennas is required to enable beamforming. The relative phase of the

antenna paths is calibrated in both uplink and downlink. This allows that the

channel information from the uplink can be used to control downlink beamforming.

At high interference, the uplink antenna calibration becomes more accurate with the

noise reduction capability. This way, the TM7 downlink UE throughput degradation can

be mitigated because the reciprocity-based downlink beamforming accuracy is

ensured.

If the Single Layer Beamforming Performance Package feature is activated, TM7 is

used. Otherwise, TM3 is used.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Single Layer Beamforming Performance Package

The Single Layer Beamforming Performance Package introduces 3GPP transmission mode 7

(TM7).

Transmission mode 7 is a mode where data is transmitted over a single spatial layer. Because

of reciprocity of the TDD channel, the beamforming measurements during uplink can be used to

estimate beamforming weights for PDSCH. The single stream data is transmitted using

beamforming antenna port 5. It is connected to all eight physical antennas with individual

weighting on each physical antenna.
