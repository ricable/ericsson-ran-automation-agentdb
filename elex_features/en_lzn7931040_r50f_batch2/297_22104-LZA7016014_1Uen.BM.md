Summary

The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature maximizes the number of blank subframes by

delaying traffic data transmission until the traffic data conditions meet a specific

threshold. This is achieved by utilizing the Micro Sleep Tx feature to turn off

power amplifiers. Blank subframes consume less energy, so the energy consumption is

reduced.

Only downlink transmission is in the scope of this feature.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Low Energy Scheduler Solution

The feature can be used together with other features to save more energy. It is

disabled if the Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access feature is activated on

the cell.

The Ericsson Lean                                 Carrier feature uses predefined DRX patterns. Therefore, the data                                 transmission patterns are also likely to be grouped by the DRX                                 patterns. Grouping the data transmission patterns can increase the                                 number of blank subframes, however, the probability for this to                                 occur is not high. |

The Micro Sleep Tx feature turns off the PA on a symbol basis             when there is no data to be transmitted, so the amount of saved energy on blank             subframes is increased. The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature can make more blank             subframes where no user data needs to be transmitted, so there are more opportunities             for when the power amplifier can be put into sleep mode.                                                             |

In such cases, the value of the                 EUtranCellFDD.lessPrbUsageThreshold attribute must be lower than             the PRB limit set on the PDSCH by the Intelligent Power Emission Control feature. In             this way, longer downlink latency can be prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In such cases, the Low Energy             Scheduler Solution feature reduces the energy consumption of radio units, and the LTE             Intelligent Temperature Handling feature reduces the temperature of radio units if             necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This is because the             feature is not partition-aware and dynamic UE admission control is not available on a             partition level. This means that an overloaded partition can effectively disable the low             energy scheduler solution, because the criteria for the delay of traffic data             transmission are not met.                                                                                                                          |

Therefore, the Low Energy Scheduler Solution             feature is disabled in fully blanked subframes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Hardware

The

feature is not supported on Massive MIMO radio units except for AIR

3283.

Limitations

For

information on the list of supported and unsupported features, see LTE RAN Feature Status.

This feature must not be used simultaneously with radio power sharing. Users must

choose one of the following options:

- Keep the Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature activated on the relevant bearer. Manually disable radio power sharing on the radio unit. For information on disabling radio power sharing, see Manage Radio Network.
- Keep radio power sharing enabled on the radio unit. The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature must be deactivated manually on the relevant bearer. For information on deactivating the Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature, see Deactivate Low Energy Scheduler Solution.

For more information about radio power sharing, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

System Functions

The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature delays data, which increases data queueing

time. As a result, KPIs based on data queueing time can decrease. The following

counters are used to measure data queueing time:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityCellDl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityCellDl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpTimeDl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpTimeDl

The total transferred data volume in a given period is not affected by the Low

Energy Scheduler Solution feature, even though downlink throughput KPIs are degraded

by the increase of data queueing time. The following counters are used to collect

the total data volume transferred in the last TTI:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbLastTTI
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbLastTTI

The frequency at which a buffer is emptied decreases because of the Low Energy

Scheduler Solution feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Low Energy Scheduler Solution

The feature reduces energy consumption by scheduling traffic data based on three

policies with two configurable time windows when the feature is active.

Time Windows

Two time windows can be configured to control when the feature is active during the

day. The following attributes are used to configure the time windows:

- EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow1EndTime
- EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow1StartTime
- EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow2EndTime
- EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow2StartTime
- EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow1EndTime
- EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow1StartTime
- EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow2EndTime
- EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow2StartTime

The first time window is configured when the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow1StartTime or the

EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow1StartTime attribute does not equal

the value of the corresponding EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow1EndTime

or the EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow1EndTime attribute.

The second time window is configured when the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow2StartTime or the

EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow2StartTime attribute does not equal

the value of the corresponding EUtranCellFDD.lessWindow2EndTime

or the EUtranCellTDD.lessWindow2EndTime attribute.

It is possible to configure only one of the time windows. If no time windows are

configured, the Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature operates during the entire

day.

Policies

When active, the feature schedules traffic data on every subframe based on the

following policies:

- Buffer filled level policy
- Predefined bearer policy
- Scheduling priority policy

Buffer Filled Level Policy

The buffer filled level policy schedules traffic data based on PRB use, which is

defined in the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.lessPrbUsageThreshold
- EUtranCellTDD.lessPrbUsageThreshold
- EUtranCellFDD.lessPrbUsageThresholdWindow2
- EUtranCellTDD.lessPrbUsageThresholdWindow2

If the percentage of PRBs required to transmit traffic data in the buffer is less

than the value of the EUtranCellFDD.lessPrbUsageThreshold or the

EUtranCellTDD.lessPrbUsageThreshold attribute for time window

one or when no time window is configured, or the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.lessPrbUsageThresholdWindow2 or the

EUtranCellTDD.lessPrbUsageThresholdWindow2 attribute for time

window two, traffic data scheduling is delayed on that subframe. Otherwise, traffic

data is scheduled normally.

Figure 1   Buffer Filled Level Policy for Low Energy Scheduler Solution

Predefined Bearer Policy

If traffic data transmission is decided only by the buffer filled level policy, an

overly long transmission delay can occur. Depending on bearer characteristics,

latency can be critical on certain bearers. The predefined bearer policy allows for

the configuration of the transmission delay on each bearer. The maximum delay can be

set through the following attributes:

- QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold
- SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThreshold
- QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2
- SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2

If traffic data in the buffer belongs to a bearer whose scheduling delay exceeds the

value of the QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold, or the

SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThreshold attribute for time window

one or when no time window is configured, or the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2, or

the SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2 attribute for time

window two, traffic data is scheduled normally. This operation does not take the

buffer filled level policy into account.

This feature can be disabled on specific bearers by setting the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold, or the

SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThreshold attribute for time window

one or when no time window is configured, or the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2, or

the SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2 attribute for time

window two to 0. This means that if the buffer has data that

belongs to a bearer where the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold, or the

SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThreshold attribute for time window

one or when no time window is configured, or the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2, or

the SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThresholdWindow2 attribute for time

window two is set to 0, traffic data is scheduled normally

regardless of the buffer filled level policy.

Figure 2   Predefined Bearer Policy for Low Energy Scheduler Solution

Scheduling Priority Policy

The scheduling priority policy is introduced to prevent high-priority traffic data

from being delayed by the Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature. The following

conditions are considered high priority by the feature:

- CCCH data
- External secondary cell data (inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation)
- MAC control element
- MBMS data
- MSG2
- PCCH data
- Retransmission data
- RRC signal
- System information
- Data that belongs to a bearer where absPrioOverride is set to HI\_PRIO\_OVERRIDE
- Data that belongs to a bearer where the priority shift occurs
- Data that belongs to a UE that is on the last subframe before the DRX inactivity timer expires or on the DRX on-duration timer period
- Data that belongs to a UE that is on the last subframe before entering the period where downlink traffic data cannot be transmitted because of a measurement gap

If any of the high priority conditions exist in the buffer, traffic data is

scheduled normally.

# 4 Network Impact of Low Energy Scheduler Solution

The feature saves energy by delaying traffic data transmission. This increases data

queuing time and latency.

Capacity and Performance

The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature delays data, which increases data queuing

time. However, no end-user throughput impact is expected.

The Low Energy Scheduler Solution feature can be configured with two

time windows that limit when the feature is operational. The impact of the feature

only occurs within the time windows.

When the feature is active, latency increases slightly, because traffic data

transmission is delayed to save energy. On bearers where latency is critical, it is

recommended to set the value of the

QciProfilePredefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold,

QciProfileOperatorDefined.lessMaxDelayThreshold, or

SciProfile.lessMaxDelayThreshold attribute to

0 or a low value.

Depending on the configuration, traffic load, and radio environment, the Low Energy

Scheduler Solution feature might affect BLER.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
