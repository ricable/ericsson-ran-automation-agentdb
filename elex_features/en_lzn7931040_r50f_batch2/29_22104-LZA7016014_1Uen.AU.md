Summary

The PUCCH Overdimensioning feature changes the frequency position of the PUCCH.

The main benefit of this feature is the capability to support a wide range of

different regulatory requirements regarding different E-UTRAN frequency bands. This

is achieved through maintaining PUCCH performance and coverage.

In specific deployment scenarios where A-MPR restrictions apply, the UE is allowed to

reduce the output power in parts of, or in the full frequency band. This reduces

interference in neighboring frequency bands. Because the PUCCH is at the band edges,

its performance is degraded if the UE output power is reduced at the band edges. The

PUCCH Overdimensioning feature allows the PUCCH region to be moved to another part

of the uplink system bandwidth where A-MPR restrictions are less severe.This way,

PUCCH performance can be secured.

In deployment scenarios where A-MPR restrictions do not apply, the transmission in

neighboring frequency bands degrades LTE system performance at the band edges. In

this case, the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature can be used to move the PUCCH region

to frequency regions with less interference from the neighboring bands.

It is only recommended to use the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature in these two

specific cases. Under normal conditions, no gain is expected from the feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Only FDD is supported.

Network Requirements

The PUCCH Overdimensioning feature, including the Limited PUSCH Allocation function,

is supported for 3 MHz bandwidth and above.

PUCCH and PRACH must have room on top of the overdimensioning depending on the system

bandwidth, so that there are enough PRBs for actual PUCCH and PRACH. If the Category

M Access feature is used, more room is needed for additional PRBs used for Cat-M

PUCCH and Cat-M PRACH.

# 3 Feature Operation of PUCCH Overdimensioning

The PUCCH Overdimensioning feature enables support for two different functions, PUCCH

Overdimensioning and Limited PUSCH Allocation. The PUCCH Overdimensioning function increases

the number of resource blocks configured for PUCCH. The Limited PUSCH Allocation function

allows configuring a limitation of the maximum number of PRBs for PUSCH.

The PUCCH Overdimensioning feature changes the frequency position of the PUCCH.

In some cases, interaction with other functions is needed to fulfill some of the

additional spectrum emission requirements according to 3GPP TS 36.101 in

conjunction with PUCCH Overdimensioning. Figure  shows the PUCCH

Overdimensioning feature with its related functions. For more information, see

Interaction with PUSCH Blocking and Interaction with A-MPR .

Operational Process

Figure 1   PUCCH Overdimensioning with Related Functions

PUCCH Overdimensioning Function

The PUCCH resources are by default located at the lower and upper band edges of the

uplink system bandwidth.

Figure 2   Uplink Band Configuration without PUCCH Overdimensioning

The PUCCH Overdimensioning feature increases the number of resource blocks configured

for PUCCH by the pucchOverdimensioning parameter. By default, no

overdimensioning is applied. The additional resource blocks configured for PUCCH are

added adjacent to the already configured PUCCH resources, towards the center of the

band. The PUCCH regions closest to the center of the band are called the Active

PUCCH region and carry PUCCH signaling for example CQI, SR and HARQ. The

overdimensioned region closest to the band edge is called the Inactive PUCCH region

and does not carry any PUCCH signaling.

Figure 3   Uplink Band Configuration with PUCCH Overdimensioning

Since no PUCCH transmission is performed in the Inactive PUCCH region, this feature

can be used to secure PUCCH performance in specific deployment scenarios where A-MPR

restrictions apply as described in PUCCH Overdimensioning Overview.

The Inactive PUCCH region is available for scheduling of PUSCH.

Limited PUSCH Allocation Function

The PUCCH Overdimensioning feature with the puschMaxNrOfPrbsPerUe

parameter allows configuring a limitation of the maximum number of PRBs for PUSCH

that the network may allocate to any UE in a cell. The

puschMaxNrOfPrbsPerUe parameter is also needed to fulfill

some of the additional spectrum emission requirements according to 3GPP TS

36.101 together with PUCCH overdimensioning. By default, no limitation is

imposed.

Interaction with PUSCH Blocking

Interaction with A-MPR

PUCCH Overdimensioning Overview

## 3.1 Interaction with PUSCH Blocking

PUSCH Blocking is a functionality to block PRBs from being used for PUSCH. This might be

required in cases when interference from adjacent bands in specific parts of the operating

band needs to be avoided. It can also be used to avoid causing interference in adjacent bands

in conjunction with the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature and A-MPR. In these scenarios PUSCH

blocking is used to avoid that resource blocks of the PUSCH are scheduled in these parts. This

function is controlled by the Flexible Channel Bandwidth parameters

EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart,

EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion and Uplink Inter-Cell

Interference Coordination (ULICIC) parameter

EUtranCellFDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive.

## 3.2 Interaction with A-MPR

The A-MPR function enables the operator to control the UE out-of-band interference in some

specific frequency bands. This is achieved by broadcasting Network Signalling (NS) values in

the cell in accordance with 3GPP TS 36.101. The A-MPR command then allows the UE

to reduce the output power to fulfill the additional spectrum emission requirements in these

bands.

The networkSignallingValue parameter defines how much power reduction the

UE is allowed to use. By default, no power reduction is allowed.

The NS values for Band 13 and Band 26 are strongly recommended to be used together with the

PUCCH Overdimensioning feature. The A-MPR specification for Band 13 allows the UE to reduce

power at the band edges up to 12 dB, and for Band 26 up to 5 dB. Without the PUCCH

Overdimensioning feature, this can have a significant impact on PUCCH performance and uplink

throughput and coverage.

# 4 Network Impact of PUCCH Overdimensioning

Capacity and Performance

In deployment scenarios with stricter UE spectral emission requirements, the PUCCH

Overdimensioning feature improves the coverage and the peak and cell UE throughput,

compared to a system without the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature. This is because of

the improved performance of the CQI and SR signaling on PUCCH. The

downlink

peak and cell throughput also improves owing to the improved performance of the

uplink HARQ transmissions.

In systems where no additional adjacent band spectral requirements or interference

requirements are present, the peak throughput is expected to decrease. This is

because of the uplink band fragmentation due to PUCCH overdimensioning. Also, if the

PUSCH Blocking function, alone or in combination with Limited PUSCH Allocation, is

applied together with the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature, the throughput might be

further decreased.

In systems where no additional adjacent band spectral requirements or interferences

requirements are present, no coverage improvement can be expected.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for PUCCH Overdimensioning

The operator sets the required number of resource blocks that must be used for the PUCCH

Overdimensioning feature at each edge of the system bandwidth. This is done using the

pucchOverdimensioning parameter. By default, this parameter is

set to zero.

Under certain conditions, the setting of the parameter

pucchOverdimensioning results in the alarm Resource Configuration Failure with additional text PUCCH

Overdimensioning configuration invalid.

For configuration details, see Manage Radio Network or Manage Bearers

and Services. For actions on how to resolve the alarm, see Resource

Configuration Failure.

If required by the deployment scenario and related regulatory requirements, one or more

of the following parameters must be set by the operator in conjunction with the PUCCH

Overdimensioning feature:

- networkSignallingValue This parameter must be set by the operator if regulatory requirements impose A-MPR to be applied. In this case it is recommended that the pucchOverdimensioning parameter is set accordingly.
- puschMaxNrOfPrbsPerUe This parameter must be set by the operator if regulatory requirements impose a restriction on the number of PRBs that the network allows any UE to use for PUSCH.
- EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart, EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion and EUtranCellFDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive These parameters must be set by the operator if regulatory requirements impose restrictions to where in the frequency band that PUSCH resources can be allocated. In some cases, regulatory requirements impose restrictions on parts of the frequency band and PUSCH resources cannot be allocated there. If this happens, these parameters must be set by the operator.
