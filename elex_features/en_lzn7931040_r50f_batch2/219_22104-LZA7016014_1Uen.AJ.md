# 1 TWAMP Initiator Overview

The TWAMP Initiator feature enables the performance measurement of the transport

network, including the X2 path, towards TWAMP light responders. TWAMP light responders

functionality is supported in RAN nodes, including the RNC.

Summary

The TWAMP initiators can measure the following metrics:

- Round-trip packet delay
- One-way packet delay variation
- One-way packet loss
- One-way packet reordering
- One-way packet duplication
- DSCP value change on round trip base

The TWAMP Initiator feature allows up to 400 test packets to be sent in each

second.

# 2 Dependencies of TWAMP Initiator

The TWAMP Initiator feature has dependent TWAMP responder and it has network

requirements.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

A TWAMP light compatible responder must be installed on a target node to receive and

send back the TWAMP test traffic sent by the TWAMP Initiator.

# 3 Feature Operation of TWAMP Initiator

The TWAMP Initiator feature enables the Baseband to act as one or more logical TWAMP

initiators. It allows a maximum of 400 test packets per second to be sent.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

A TWAMP session can be set up for one DSCP value to monitor the end-to-end path for a

QoS in class over a transport network. By setting up sessions for different services

in the network, the operator can verify if QoS is working as planned during

congestion.

# 4 Network Impact of TWAMP Initiator

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
