# 1 Service-Specific HARQ Overview

The feature allows the setting of the maximum number of HARQ transmissions based on

the current set of UE bearers.

Summary

A HARQ priority is set for each QCI to decide the maximum number of HARQ

transmissions. The maximum number of HARQ transmissions of the QCI with the highest

HARQ priority is applied to all established UE bearers. This means, the maximum

number of retransmissions for a UE might change because of the changes in QCI. It is

also recommended to enable the automatic configuration of the tReordering timer to

fully benefit from the feature.

When the UE is in poor radio conditions, the feature can improve the performance of

specific services. The improved performance is achieved with a reduced impact on

system capacity compared to applying the same maximum number of HARQ transmissions

for all services.

# 3 Feature Operation of Service-Specific HARQ

The operation of the feature involves E-RAB setup, release, and modification for uplink

and downlink traffic.

Operational Process in Uplink

Figure 1   E-RAB Setup, Release, and Modification in Uplink

1. Service-Specific HARQ sequence is triggered when one of the following S1AP messages is received:
    - E-RAB Setup
    - E-RAB Release
    - E-RAB Modify E-RAB Modification can change QCI profile for an existing bearer.
2. The value of MACConfiguration.ulMaxHARQTx is decided by using one of the following methods:
    - If the UE is not in TTI bundling mode, QCI profiles are scanned for all setup bearers. After scanning, the ulMaxHARQTxQci attribute of the QCI profile with the highest HARQ priority determines the value of the MACConfiguration.ulMaxHARQTx attribute.
    - If the UE is in TTI bundling mode, the value of the MACConfiguration.ulTtiBundlingMaxHARQTx attribute is used as the MACConfiguration.ulMaxHARQTx attribute. QCI profiles do not affect the MACConfiguration.ulMaxHARQTx attribute if TTI bundling mode is active. For more information about TTI bundling, see TTI Bundling.
3. If the EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or the EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration attribute is set to true, the tReorderingUl timer for the bearers in unacknowledged mode is calculated with the formula: tReorderingUl = ulMaxHARQTxQci × HARQ-interval + harqOffsetUl Table 2 HARQ-Interval for FDD and TDD Cell Type TTI Bundling Off TTI Bundling On FDD 8 ms 16 ms TDD 10 ms N/A If the MACConfiguration.ulMaxHARQTx parameter is changed because of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.harqPriority or the QciProfilePredefined.harqPriority attribute with the highest value, the uplink scheduler uses a new tReorderingUl parameter for all setup bearers for the UE. If the EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or the EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration attribute is set to false or the bearer is in acknowledged mode, the tReorderingUl attribute is used.

Operational Process in Downlink

Figure 2   E-RAB Setup, Release, and Modification in Downlink

1. Service-Specific HARQ sequence is triggered when one of the following S1AP messages is received:
    - E-RAB Setup
    - E-RAB Release
    - E-RAB Modify E-RAB Modification can change QCI profile for an existing bearer.
2. The value of maxHARQTx is set by using dlMaxHARQTxQci.
3. If the EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or the EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration attribute is set to true, the tReorderingDl timer for the bearers in unacknowledged mode is calculated with the formula: tReorderingDl = dlMaxHARQTxQci × HARQ-interval + harqOffsetDl. Table 3 HARQ-Interval for FDD and TDD Cell Type HARQ-interval FDD 8 ms TDD 10 ms When the MACConfiguration.dlMaxHARQTx attribute is changed because of the QciProfileOperatorDefined.harqPriority or the QciProfilePredefined.harqPriority attribute with the highest value, the downlink scheduler uses a new tReorderingDl attribute only for the bearer currently being set up. This is because of uncertainties regarding UE behavior when modifying the value of the tReorderingDl attribute for an existing bearer. Existing bearers are not updated. If the EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or the EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration attribute is set to false or the bearer is in acknowledged mode, the tReorderingDl attribute is used.

To improve

Radio Link Control (RLC) performance, the value of 25 ms is used in RRC

reconfiguration messages for downlink AM DRBs instead of the value configured in the

QciProfilePredefined.tReorderingDl or

QciProfileOperatorDefined.tReorderingDl attribute if all the

following conditions are fulfilled for UEs with 3CC Carrier Aggregation

capability:

- The UE is at least Category 11.
- The 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature is activated.
- The UE is capable of at least 3CC Carrier Aggregation.
- The QciProfilePredefined.rlcMode or QciProfileOperatorDefined.rlcMode attribute of the same MO instance is set to AM.

# 4 Network Impact of Service-Specific HARQ

The feature has an impact on the VoLTE, RLC UM, and RLC AM services, and on the Uu

interface.

Capacity and Performance

Setting a higher maximum number of HARQ transmissions can positively impact the voice

service (RLC in unacknowledged mode), VoLTE or PTT. For other services, for example

web browsing (RLC in acknowledged mode), applying moderate values is

recommended.

Setting high values for maximum number of HARQ transmissions for all traffic results

in consuming unnecessary capacity in the scheduling elements, TTI, and PDCCH. System

resource usage can be improved by changing the maximum number of HARQ transmissions

only for UEs with targeted services.

Interfaces

When ulMaxHARQTx or harqPriority is

changed, the change is included in IE Mac-MainConfig in

rrcConnectionReconfiguration.

If the EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or the

EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration attribute is set

to true, it affects the tReorderingDl

parameter based on the maximum number of HARQ transmissions. When a new bearer is

set up, tReorderingDl is included in the IE

Mac-MainConfig in rrcConnectionReconfiguration.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Service-Specific HARQ

This feature introduces attributes associated with bearer-level QoS

configuration.

# 6 Performance of Service-Specific HARQ

The feature improves KPIs related to VoLTE speech quality, and handover success rate.

The improvement is more pronounced in poor radio conditions.

KPIs

The feature has limited impact on system resource usage as only specific services use

an increased number of HARQ transmissions. The impact is expected to be most

noticeable in areas with poor radio conditions.

Table 5   Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Service-Specific HARQ

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

The license key is installed in the node.

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012070 MO instance.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.enableServiceSpecificHARQ or the EUtranCellTDD.enableServiceSpecificHARQ attribute to ENABLED.
3. Use EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration to enable automatic configuration of tReorderingDl and tReorderingUl for bearers in unacknowledged mode.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Service-Specific HARQ

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012070 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Service-Specific HARQ

When the EUtranCellFDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration or the

EUtranCellTDD.tReorderingAutoConfiguration attribute is set to

true, the tReorderingDl and

tReorderingUl timers are calculated automatically for bearers

in unacknowledged mode. Bearers in acknowledged mode always take

tReorderingDl or tReorderingUl from the

QCI profile.
