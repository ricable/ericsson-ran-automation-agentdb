# 1 Dynamic Random Access Backoff Overview

This feature improves the random access success rate, and decreases inter-cell

interference and connection latency for the UEs connecting to the eNodeB.

| Feature Name           | Dynamic Random Access Backoff                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4299                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | High Load Handling                                                         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0415                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Dynamic Random Access Backoff feature has the following benefits:

- Improved inter-cell interference
- Improved Random Access success rate
- Lower latency for UEs connecting to the eNodeB to reacquire uplink synchronization
- Lower latency for UEs connecting to the eNodeB to request an uplink grant using the Scheduling Request Random Access Channel when the random access load is high

It is possible to observe potential benefits of the feature without activating it in

the following way:

- The introduced EUtranCellFDD.pmRaBackoffDistr or EUtranCellTDD.pmRaBackoffDistr PM counters are always populated, even if the license is not activated. By observing the distribution of the Random Access backoff value, an indication of the benefits of feature activation can be obtained.
- A distribution of the Random Access backoff value that significantly deviates from zero indicates that activation of this feature is beneficial.

# 7 Activate Dynamic Random Access Backoff

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011937 MO instance.
2. Lock and unlock the cell after changing the feature state.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Dynamic Random Access Backoff

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011937 MO instance.
2. Lock and unlock the cell after changing the feature state.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
