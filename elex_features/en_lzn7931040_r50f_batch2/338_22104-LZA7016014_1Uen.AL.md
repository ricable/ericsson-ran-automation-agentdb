# 1 Virtual Sectors Overview

The Virtual Sectors feature provides high-order sectorization with three 8T8R radios

(TDD).

| Feature Name           | Virtual Sectors                                           |

| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0562                                              |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                       |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                       |

Summary

This feature uses the benefits of 8T8R beamforming to provide six sectors with only

three radios. Using this feature improves the coverage, especially for the border

with two physical sectors. Operators can reduce the deployment cost and increase the

efficiency by supporting more sectors based on current radios in low traffic

area.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

The amplitude and phase settings of this feature can be configured based on the

antenna degree shift.

Values vary between the different antenna vendors, so it is recommended to use the values

provided by the vendors for the following attributes:

- SectorCarrier.virtualComChBeamfrmWtsAmplitude
- SectorCarrier.virtualComChBeamfrmWtsPhase
- AntennaSubunit.commonChBeamfrmPortMap

The presented configuration is an example used on an RRUS 82 band 41 radio in lab

tests:

|--------------|-------|-----|-----|-------|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Phase:       |     0 |  90 | 180 |   270 |     0 |  90 | 180 |   270 |

AntennaSubunit.virtualSector = true

Virtual Sectors Compatibility

In the following cases, there are compatibility issues between Carrier Aggregation,

Inter-Frequency Load Balancing, and Virtual Sectors:

- When Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is activated after Virtual Sectors, the SCell candidate relations must be set to the overlapping virtual sectors.
- When Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is activated before Virtual Sectors, although Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing cannot work, the Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing configuration between these virtual sectors can be kept anyway. The license for Virtual Sectors can be turned off to use Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing again.
- Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing cannot work between virtual sectors, but Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load Balancing is still possible between a virtual sector and a normal sector. For an example, see figure below.

Figure 2   Compatible Configuration for Carrier Aggregation or Inter-Frequency Load

Balancing

There are three carriers for each radio. One carrier (f3) covers the full physical

sector and the other two carriers (f1 and f2) cover the virtual sectors.
