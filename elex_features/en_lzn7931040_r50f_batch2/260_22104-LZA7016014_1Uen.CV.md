Summary

The 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature supports the capability to transmit

data to a single UE on three carriers simultaneously.

In addition, a band combination signaling is introduced according to 3GPP TS

36.331. The introduced band combination signaling enables UEs supporting

more than 128 band combinations to provide all relevant band combinations to the

eNodeB. The UE only reports carrier aggregation band combinations for specific bands

requested by the eNodeB. This replaces the reporting of all the supported carrier

aggregation band combinations.

By supporting a higher number of MIMO layers, a higher spectrum efficiency with

higher peak downlink throughput can be achieved.

The maximum number of MIMO layers that can be configured for the UE depends on the

following characteristics:

- Corresponding capacity and peak rate limitations of the eNodeB Baseband platform
- Corresponding capacity and peak rate limitations of the UE capabilities

The feature has the following benefits:

- The downlink speed is increased across the coverage area.
- A more efficient use of scattered spectrum makes it possible to combine up to three components of the LTE spectrum.
- The end-user experience is improved through achieving peak throughput based on the system configurations, the number of component carriers, and the number of TX layers in unit of Mbps at the physical layer.
- In a TDD deployment, HARQ-ACK feedback information is clearer, leading to lower BLER, and higher and more stable downlink throughput.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The UE must support 3GPP Release 13 or later.

- 256 QAM
- 16-bit RLC Sequence Number length
- 15-bit PDCP Sequence Number length

# 3 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension Feature Operation

The 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature enables the UE to use up to three

downlink component carriers and one uplink component carrier at the same time. This alters the

behavior of dynamic SCell selection and also impacts the activation and deactivation of

SCells.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

With the Carrier Aggregation feature, a UE uses resources from multiple cells. With 3CC DL

Carrier Aggregation Extension, the UE uses up to three downlink component carriers (CC) and

one uplink component carrier at the same time.

Figure 1   3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

Process Steps of Dynamic Secondary Cell Configuration and Deconfiguration

When the 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature license is enabled, dynamic SCell

selection behaves as follows:

- A UE is evaluated for Carrier Aggregation at initial attachment, re-establishment, or incoming handover.
- Both the first and the second SCell are configured using blind-selection. The initial selection and configuration of SCells depends on the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute: CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode Value Configuration ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCell\_SELECTION SCells are selected and configured in sequence. A1 is configured per SCell to confirm the coverage. The second SCell is only selected once the first SCell has been concluded to be in coverage. ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCell\_SELECTION Two SCells are selected and configured simultaneously. A1 is configured per SCell to confirm the coverage. UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCell\_SELECTION Two SCells are selected and configured simultaneously. Since this mode assumes SCells have good coverage, no A1 is configured to reduce RRC overhead. Note: In simultaneous SCell selection modes, the SCell uplink carrier aggregation evaluation is made by means of the CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference attribute. For more information, see Uplink Carrier Aggregation.
- For the initial SCell selection of the first and second SCell, SCell selection priority can be used to determine which SCell candidate, within a given frequency, is preferred. The prioritization is enabled by setting the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute to indicate cell overlap. The priority is then based on what type of overlap the cells have. The priority order is as follows where the default value 0 means that no prioritization is applied: 1 (COVERS) 2 (OVERLAP) 3 (CONTAINED\_IN) 0 (NONE) To use the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute with value 1 (COVERS) for SCell selection prioritization without also enabling blind handover, blind handover must be manually disabled. Otherwise it becomes enabled for the cells where the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to value 1 (COVERS) . The disabling is done by setting the EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute to FALSE.
- The maximum TX layers that both the eNodeB and UE can support are reconfigured on each component carrier. If the maximum TX layers are changed on a component carrier because of another SCell being added or removed, they are reconfigured at the same time along with SCell reconfiguration.
- Both SCells are implicitly deconfigured upon release of the UE.
- Both SCells are deconfigured at incoming handover. However, the UE is configured with one or more SCells in the target cell following the same procedure as at initial access.
- An SCell is deconfigured when the UE has poor coverage (A2) or there is interference (A6) from another cell. Also, it is triggered separately for the first and second SCell.
- An SCell is deconfigured at SCell change (A6) and an SCell candidate cell with stronger signal is configured as the new SCell. Also, it is triggered separately for the first and second SCell.

For more details, see Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation.

Process Steps of Dynamic Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation

The SCell activation and deactivation triggers are the following:

- Need based: Activate or deactivate, based on buffer occupancy.
- Coverage based: Deactivate, based on poor SCell coverage.
- Prohibit timer to avoid ping-pong effect.
- SCell is deactivated as a result of cell lock or eMBMS start or stop.
- When both SCells are configured, the SCell with highest SCell index is deactivated based on poor PCell Uplink Channel condition.
- Activation based on buffer occupancy triggers activation of one or two SCells: The SCell which has the lowest SCell index is activated first.
- Deactivation, based on buffer occupancy triggers deactivation of one SCell at a time: The SCell which provides the lowest potential throughput is deactivated, or The SCell which is located at a different Baseband unit from PCell is deactivated.
- Potential throughput: Calculated based on bandwidth, number of code words and channel condition. These are only used for deactivation decision as CQI is only reported for activated SCells.

For more details, see Carrier Aggregation.

# 4 Network Impact of 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

With the feature allowing up to two configured SCells per UE, the loading limit is

reached by fewer UEs. By stopping SCell configuration before the limit is reached, carrier

aggregation UEs cannot block new UEs from attaching to the system, therefore the system

capacity is increased.

Capacity and Performance

A UE configured with an SCell consumes more resources (one for the PCell and one for

each configured SCell) than a UE having only a PCell. However, it is still counted

as one connected UE from a connected UE license perspective. As the 3CC DL Carrier

Aggregation Extension feature allows up to two configured SCells per UE, the loading

limit is reached by fewer UEs than previously.

At additional SCell configuration during initial connection, connection reestablishment,

or incoming handover, the following impacts apply to UEs configured with carrier

aggregation:

- The number of RRC connection reconfiguration procedures increases when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.
- The size of the RrcConnectionReconfiguration and HandoverPreparationInformation messages and the time to complete the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure might increase when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION or ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION.

Existing mechanisms with the right configuration ensure that SCell configuration is

stopped before the loading limit is reached. By doing this, carrier aggregation UEs

are prevented from blocking attachment of new UEs into the system. For more

information, see Carrier Aggregation.

Additional resources are required on PUCCH for transmission of SCell downlink HARQ

ACK. For more information, see Control Channel Dimensioning.

Mobility

The feature has no impact on mobility since mobility is based on PCell coverage.

Other Network Elements

The feature is applicable only for 3GPP Release 13 or later UEs. UEs of earlier releases are not affected by the feature.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q4: 1.2 Gbps DL Enhancement for 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

The feature improvement is expected to increase UE downlink throughput for UEs that are in very good channel condition.

| Feature Name:           | 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3084  R5                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation                    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405 R9                        |
| Node Type:              | Baeband Radio Node                     |
| Access Type:            | LTE and Multi-Standard RBS             |

The feature improvement enables the 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension to reach a higher

spectrum efficiency with a peak downlink throughput of near 1.2 Gbps by using 12 MIMO

layers.

The following limitations apply to 3/4/5 CC with 12 layers MIMO:

- System verification of performance has not been completed due to late availability of UE that supports 12 layers MIMO.
- IODT verification of 5CC with 12 layers MIMO has not been performed since commercial support for UE capable of 5CC with 12 layers MIMO is not available.

Capacity and Performance

The UE downlink throughput is expected to increase for UEs that are in very good channel

condition.
