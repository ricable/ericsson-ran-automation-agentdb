Summary

The peak downlink throughput depends on the configuration of the 5CC duplex mode and

the type of carrier aggregation deployment (Intra-band, Inter-eNodeB, or Elastic

RAN).

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Capability is supported to transmit data to a single UE on five carriers simultaneously, up to a total bandwidth of 100 MHz.
- A more efficient use of scattered spectrum makes it possible to combine up to five components of the LTE spectrum.
- The maximum UE downlink throughput is increased because of an extra component carrier.
- The average UE downlink throughput is increased through supporting a higher number of MIMO layers.
- The spectrum efficiency is increased with the throughput because of an extra component carrier.
- The radio channel requirements for realizing peak UE downlink throughput near 1.2 Gbps are less stringent.
- With the Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access feature, the mixed combination of licensed FDD and LAA SCells is supported on 5CC downlink carrier aggregation. This combination allows for the use of a mix of licensed and unlicensed spectrum for carrier aggregation.
- More carrier aggregation candidates are provided.

Hardware

The feature is supported only on RAN Compute units. However, 5CC UEs with their PCell

on a Baseband Radio Node can use SCells on a DU Radio Node with the Inter-eNodeB

Carrier Aggregation feature.

To reach downlink throughput around 2 Gbps, all component carriers must be on the

same RAN Compute unit and must have 20 MHz bandwidth.

This feature is not supported on AIR 6454 units.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

- To reach 20 MIMO layers, UE category 20 is required.
- To benefit from the 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature, a UE must support at least one 5CC inter-band or intra-band combination that is also supported by and provisioned on the eNodeB.
- To reach peak downlink throughput with five component carriers, a UE must support 3GPP Release 13 or later.
- For TDD peak throughput, a UE must support uplink-downlink configuration 2 with Special Subframe configuration 7 on all component carriers.
- The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following factors: Number and bandwidth of the component carriers Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA) Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM) Node hardware For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN. Note: For the highest possible throughput, ensure that the required level of HWACs is available.

# 3 Feature Operation of 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension Sequence Diagram

## 3.1 Dynamic Secondary Cell Configuration and Deconfiguration

.

SCell Configuration

- A UE is evaluated for carrier aggregation at initial attach, re-establishment, and incoming handover.
- The first, second, third and fourth SCells are configured using blind selection. The initial selection and configuration of SCells depends on the attribute CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode: If CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION, SCells are selected and configured in sequence. A1 is configured for each SCell to confirm the coverage. The second SCell is only selected after the first SCell is confirmed to be in coverage. The third SCell is only selected after the second SCell is confirmed to be in coverage. The fourth SCell is only selected after the third SCell is confirmed to be in coverage. If CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION, four SCells are selected and configured in a single RRC message. A1 is configured for each SCell to confirm the coverage. If CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION, four SCells are selected and configured in a single RRC message. This mode requires that the SCells concerned have good coverage. To reduce RRC overhead, no A1 measurements are configured.

See Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation for more

information.

SCell Deconfiguration

- All four SCells are implicitly deconfigured when the UE is released.
- All four SCells are deconfigured at incoming handover. However, the UE is configured with one or more SCells in the target cell following the same procedure as at initial access.
- An SCell is deconfigured when serving becomes worse than the threshold, or at SCell change, when the neighboring offset becomes better than the SCell with a stronger signal. This process is conducted separately for each SCell.
- All the valid frequencies are tried.
- When serving becomes worse than the threshold, or the UE has fewer configured SCells than the maximum possible due to coverage.

See Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation for more

information.

## 3.2 Dynamic Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation

The SCell activation and deactivation triggers are the following:

- Need based: Activate or deactivate the feature based on buffer occupancy.
- Coverage based: Deactivate the feature based on poor SCell coverage.
- Aperiodic CQI report based: Deactivate the feature based on the lack of aperiodic CQI reporting from the SCell.
- Data-triggered deactivation condition is never satisfied if the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.dcSCellActDeactDataThres attribute or the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellActDeactDataThres attribute is -1. In this case, deactivation based on no SCell aperiodic reporting is possible to be increased.
- Prohibit timers to avoid ping-pong effect.
- SCell is deactivated as a result of cell lock or evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS) start or stop.
- Up to two SCells are deactivated when the PCell uplink SINR remains below 3.8 dB for at least 100 ms. To avoid the deactivation of the remaining SCells, it is recommended to set the following: CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellDeactOutOfCoverageTimer &gt;= MAX(240, 3*CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellDeactProhibitTimer + 100) ms or: CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellDeactOutOfCoverageTimer = -1
- Activation based on buffer occupancy triggers activation of up to four SCells.
- Deactivation based on buffer occupancy triggers deactivation of one of the following SCells at a time: The SCell that provides the lowest potential throughput The SCell that is located on a different node from the PCell
- Potential throughput is calculated based on bandwidth, the number of code words, and channel condition. These are only used for deactivation decision as CQI is only reported to activated SCells.

For more details, see Carrier Aggregation.

## 3.3 License-Assisted Access

For the 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension feature, the mixed combination of maximum

three LAA SCells with FDD SCells is supported.

The following mixed combinations are supported::

- Licensed FDD PCell, one licensed FDD SCell, and three unlicensed LAA SCells
- Licensed FDD PCell, two licensed FDD SCells, and two unlicensed LAA SCells
- Licensed FDD PCell, three licensed FDD SCells, and one unlicensed LAA SCell.

With these combinations, a peak downlink throughput of

1.958

Gbps is achieved.

# 4 Network Impact of 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

Capacity and Performance

Existing mechanisms, with the right configuration, ensure that SCell configuration is

stopped before the loading limit is reached. By doing this, UEs with carrier

aggregation are prevented from blocking attachment of new UEs into the system. For

more information, see Carrier Aggregation.

At additional SCell configuration during initial connection, connection

reestablishment, or incoming handover, the following impacts apply to UEs configured

with carrier aggregation:

- The number of RRC connection reconfiguration procedures will increase when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.
- The size of the RrcConnectionReconfiguration and HandoverPreparationInformation messages and the time to complete the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure might increase when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION or ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION. If there is a handover, this can impact handover interruption time.

At the eNodeB level, the number of RRC connection reconfiguration procedures

increases as the number of UEs configured with 5CC increases. The number of RRC

connection reconfiguration procedures also increases in proportion to any increase

in A2 and A6 events, due to SCell deconfiguration or reselection triggered by these

events.

Due to an additional configured SCell, the intensity of A1, A2 and A6 events can

increase as the number of UEs configured with 5CC increases.

When four SCells are configured, up to two additional HARQ feedback bits are required

compared to when three SCells are configured. This does not require any change to

control channel dimensioning compared to 4CC. However, when HARQ feedback is sent on

PUSCH, uplink throughput can be impacted.

Aperiodic CSI reports can be obtained less frequently for each serving cell when four

SCells are configured, compared to when three or fewer SCells are configured. This

can reduce the downlink HARQ success rate and downlink throughput for UEs in

fast-fading conditions.

Interfaces

The eNodeB supports decoding of the extendedRLC-SN-SO-Field-r13 RRC IE, which

indicates the capability of a UE to support 16-bit RLC SN length. The eNodeB

configures a new RLC bearer with 16-bit SN if:

- rlcMode = AM for the QCI of this bearer
- rlcSNLength = 16 for the QCI of this bearer
- extendedRLC-SN-SO-Field-r13 is indicated by UE
- The 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension license is enabled
- The UE is capable of at least 5CC carrier aggregation

Other Network Elements

No impact is expected from this feature.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q4: 1.2 Gbps DL Enhancement for 4CC and 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension

This enhancement is expected to increase the UE downlink throughput for UEs that are in very good channel condition.

The feature improvement enables the 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension and 5CC DL Carrier

Aggregation Extension to reach a higher spectrum efficiency with a peak downlink

throughput of near 1.2 Gbps by using 12 MIMO layers.

The following limitations apply to 3/4/5 CC with 12 layers MIMO:

- System verification of performance has not been completed due to late availability of UE that supports 12 layers MIMO.
- IODT verification of 5CC with 12 layers MIMO has not been performed since commercial support for UE capable of 5CC with 12 layers MIMO is not available.

Capacity and Performance

The UE downlink throughput is expected to increase for UEs that are in very good channel

condition.
