Summary

The Uplink Scheduler allocates SE to high priority UEs in a more focused way than PUSCH,

which tends SEs to be partitioned in roughly equal parts.

It is limited from both upper and lower sides how the allocation is allowed regarding

focus.

The upper limit is used to maintain throughput for lower prioritized UEs. The upper limit

is based on:

- the UE TX power
- the amount of data that the UE sends
- the relative scheduling priority of the UE

The lower limit is used to avoid the risk of degradation of high priority and GBR data on

cell edge. More dynamic and focused allocating behavior provides higher cell throughput and

better PRB use for low priority UEs in bad radio environment.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation

The Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation feature adds a new scheduling mode to partition

the spectrum more greedy compared to equal sharing.

The feature can operate together with all existing scheduling methods.

The largest possible number of resource blocks is allocated to one single highest-prioritized

UE, unless it is power-limited.

In Figure 1, when all available

data throughput is used, the throughput level flattens out. As the throughput is equally

shared, the level is equal for both UEs, that is, MaxThroughput divided by two.

Figure 1   Uplink Throughput when Feature Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation is Disabled

In Figure 2, the UE data throughput

follows each other until its level is MaxThroughput divided by two. After this, the UE with

relative priority 2 can use more data throughput and UE with relative priority 1 has to give

away its data throughput capacity. This is because scheduling is done more greedy. Finally,

when the relative priority difference is reached, the throughput levels flatten out.

Figure 2   Uplink Throughput when Feature Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation is Enabled

In case the UEs are moving away from the base station, the behavior is the same. The UE with

relative priority 2 is power-limited so it cannot use the full data throughput. The available

data throughput capacity then used by the UE with relative priority 1.

# 4 Network Impact of Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation

Depending on the channel conditions and the radio conditions of high priority UEs,

enhanced uplink cell throughput and PRB use can be observed.

Capacity and Performance

When all UEs have running VoLTE and uplink background data traffic, the number of SEs

for which VoLTE satisfaction can be met is expected to decrease. This is because

uplink background data traffic freerides on the higher priority given by VoLTE

service. Dynamic Uplink Resource Allocation favors UEs with good channel conditions

and allocates these larger resource, and thereby increases the problem with

freeriding.

In overloaded cells, if UEs in the cell have good channel conditions, there is a risk

that radio link failures increase. This is because with Dynamic Uplink Resource

Allocation the Scheduler is allowed to schedule fewer UEs for each TTI when channel

conditions are good. As a result, the interval between a UE gets scheduled in two

consecutive occasions is too long and fewer number of UEs are scheduled in the

cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
