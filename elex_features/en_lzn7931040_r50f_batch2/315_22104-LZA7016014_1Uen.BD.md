Summary

The capabilities enabled by the Ethernet OAM Service feature are useful in networks operated

by multiple independent organizations, each with restricted management access to the

network equipment of the other networks. The feature also introduces the following

functions:

- Path discovery
- Fault notification
- Performance monitoring

The Ethernet OAM Service feature is transparent to the customer data transported by the

network and provides maximum fault coverage.

The Ethernet OAM Service feature is available for both optical and electrical

ports.

# 2 Dependencies of Ethernet OAM Service

The Ethernet OAM Service feature is not supported on AIR 6454

units.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

This feature is not supported on AIR 6454 units.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a

valid license key must be installed, and the feature must be explicitly activated by

setting a MOM attribute.

# 3 Feature Operation of Ethernet OAM Service

The Ethernet OAM Service feature implements Ethernet CFM protocols.

The Ethernet OAM Service is an optional and licensed feature. It implements the Ethernet CFM

protocol, which regards the Ethernet network as a hierarchy of Maintenance Domains (MDs). A

Maintenance Domain is identified by its domain name, and its position in the hierarchy is

identified by the domain level. Each Maintenance Domain is further segmented into Maintenance

Associations (MAs). Each Maintenance Association is uniquely identifiable within its

Maintenance Domain. A Maintenance Association consists of MEPs and Maintenance domain

Intermediate Points (MIPs). MEPs are at the edge of a Maintenance Domain, while MIPs are in

the interior.

Figure 1   CFM Overview

When Ethernet OAM Service is enabled, up to

16 MEPs can be created on the

Baseband Radio Node.

Related concepts

Continuity Check Protocol

Loopback Protocol

Linktrace Protocol

Delay Measurement Protocol

Synthetic Loss Measurement Protocol

## 3.1 Continuity Check Protocol

Continuity Check detects connectivity failures in a Maintenance

Association.

Each MEP can be configured to transmit CCMs periodically.

A connectivity failure is reported if one of the following happens:

- One of the MEPs in the Maintenance Association stops transmitting CCMs.
- One of the MEPs in the Maintenance Association starts transmitting faulty CCMs.
- The messages are lost somewhere in the network between MEPs.

Figure 2   Continuity Check Protocol

## 3.2 Loopback Protocol

Loopback protocol is used for fault verification and isolation.

Loopback protocol consists of two messages, LBM and LBR.

A configured local MEP can act both as a Loopback Responder and as a Loopback Initiator.

As a Loopback Responder, the MEP receives an LBM from another MEP, and returns an LBR.

As a Loopback Initiator, the MEP sends an LBM to another Maintenance Point, which is a MEP or

a Maintenance domain Intermediate Point (MIP), and receives an LBR. The Loopback Initiator is

activated when an operator runs the  EthernetOamLocalMep.loopBack operation

on a configured local MEP. The MAC address of the target Maintenance Point is set as an

attribute of the action.

For

Baseband Radio Node, see the CLI command cfm loopback in Transport Network Troubleshooting Guideline.

Figure 3   Loopback Protocol

## 3.3 Linktrace Protocol

Linktrace protocol is used for path discovery and fault isolation.

Linktrace protocol consists of two messages, Linktrace Message (LTM) and Linktrace Reply

(LTR).

A configured local MEP can act both as a Linktrace Responder and as a Linktrace Initiator.

As a Linktrace Responder, the MEP receives a Linktrace Message from another MEP, and returns

a Linktrace Reply.

As a Linktrace Initiator, the MEP sends a Linktrace Message toward another Maintenance Point.

The message is forwarded from Maintenance domain Intermediate Point (MIP) to MIP until it

reaches the specified target, or can no longer be forwarded. Each Maintenance Point along the

path to the target, including the target Maintenance Point, sends a Linktrace Message to the

originating MEP. The Linktrace Initiator is activated when an operator runs the linkTrace operation on a configured local MEP. The MAC address of

the target Maintenance Point is set as an attribute of the action.

For

Baseband Radio Node, see the CLI command cfm linktrace in Transport Network Troubleshooting Guideline.

Figure 4   Linktrace Protocol

## 3.4 Delay Measurement Protocol

Delay Measurement measures frame delay and frame delay variation.

Delay Measurement is an ITU Y.1731 performance monitoring protocol. It

consists of two messages, Delay Measurement Message and Delay Measurement Reply.

A configured local MEP can only act as a Delay Measurement Responder. As a responder, the

MEP receives a Delay Measurement Message from another MEP and returns a Delay

Measurement Reply.

The CLI command show y1731-responder counters displays the counters

for the number of Delay Measurement Message packets received, and the number of Delay

Measurement Reply packets sent. The command is run at the local MEP. For further

information, see Transport Network Troubleshooting Guideline.

Figure 5   Delay Measurement Protocol

## 3.5 Synthetic Loss Measurement Protocol

Synthetic Loss Measurement measures frame loss by using synthetic frames.

Synthetic Loss Measurement is an ITU Y.1731 performance monitoring protocol.

It consists of two messages, Synthetic Loss Message and Synthetic Loss Reply.

A configured local MEP can only act as a Synthetic Loss Measurement Responder. As a

responder, the MEP receives a Synthetic Loss Message from another MEP and returns a

Synthetic Loss Reply. If a Synthetic Loss Message session is idle, it has a 15-minute

time-out value.

The CLI command show y1731-responder counters displays the counters

for the number of Synthetic Loss Message packets received and the number of Synthetic

Loss Reply packets sent. The command is run at the local MEP. For further information,

see Transport Network Troubleshooting Guideline.
