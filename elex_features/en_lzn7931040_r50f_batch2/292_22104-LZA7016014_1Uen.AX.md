Summary

Ethernet Link Aggregation is introduced in IEEE 802.3ad standard, specified in the

IEEE 802.1AX. It is a standard for aggregating multiple Ethernet links so that they

can be used as a single link. The aggregated link has higher bandwidth and

availability than a single link. The higher bandwidth is provided by Ethernet Link

Aggregation through distributing egress traffic over all of the links in the

aggregate. Although the Ethernet LAG is observed as a single link, it is physically

composed of the separate Ethernet cables between the Baseband radio node and the

switch.

The total capacity of the interface is the sum of the individual links. An Ethernet

flow always uses the same physical link, so the peak rate of one Ethernet flow is

still limited to the capacity of the individual link. Availability is increased

because the aggregated link is available as long as any link is available. If one

Ethernet link in an Ethernet LAG goes down, the remaining links continue to carry

traffic, so Ethernet port redundancy is provided as well.

# 2 Dependencies of Ethernet Link Aggregation

The Ethernet Link Aggregation feature needs multiple Ethernet ports to be

available.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No specific hardware requirements.

Network Requirements

The feature requires the Multiple Ethernet Ports (FAK 101 0071) hardware-related

feature to be activated.

# 3 Feature Operation of Ethernet Link Aggregation

With the Ethernet Link Aggregation feature, the different traffic flows get even load

distribution on the links.

The same properties for speed and duplex need to be configured at both ends of the Ethernet

link because Auto Negotiation is not supported. The Auto Negotiation is a function to

negotiate transport parameters between devices with different transmission

parameters.

In a LAG ingress, packets are received on all links and processed as if received from a

single interface. All egress packets in a traffic flow are sent over the same link to

ensure that the packets are not reordered. The method used to assign traffic flows to

links is based on the fields in the packet headers. For the traffic on the Link layer,

the link selection method is calculated based on source and destination MAC address. For

the Internet layer traffic, such as IP packets, the link selection method is calculated

based on source and destination IP address, ports, and protocol. This means that

different traffic flows get a more even load distribution on the links, which is the

main advantage of the LAG feature.

A special case is that the IPsec as an IPsec tunnel is a single flow, regardless of the

number of flows inside the tunnel. This means that IPsec with LAG feature gives

low-bandwidth use of the aggregated link, because all traffic in one IPsec tunnel is

sent trough a single Ethernet link.

The QoS is supported on link level, which means that an egress packet is first assigned to a

link and then queue processing is done. This means that traffic can be shaped for each

individual link but not on the aggregated level. Each link in the LAG has its own queue

system. The configuration is done with the legacy Ethernet QoS settings. It is required

that all links in a LAG have the same QoS configuration. If one of the Ethernet links is

broken, the QoS is still supported within the LAG because all links that are part of

that LAG group have the same QoS configuration.

# 4 Network Impact of Ethernet Link Aggregation

Using Ethernet Link Aggregation increases throughput and availability on the Transport

Network.

Capacity and Performance

The maximum throughput on the aggregated link depends on the number flows present

over the aggregated link and the amount of traffic in each flow. This is because,

the way link aggregation distributes traffic flows to links based on a link

selection calculation method. Multiple flows mean that the throughput gets close to

the total capacity of the links. A single flow means that only the capacity of one

link can be used. The peak rate of a single flow over an aggregated link is not

higher than the peak rate for the same flow over a single link.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Addition or removal of an EthernetPort within an LAG can cause a

temporary holdover in the sync reference. When an EthernetPort MO

is already used by SyncE or PTP and selected as the active reference, adding or

removing the EthernetPort on a LagPort causes

sync reference change or temporary holdover.

# 5 Parameters for Ethernet Link Aggregation

The Ethernet Link Aggregation feature introduces parameters for configuration of the MO

instances representing Ethernet ports.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                   | Type       | Description          |
|-----------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| LagPort.administrativeState | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LagPort.availabilityStatus  | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LagPort.encapsulation       | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LagPort.lacpEnabled         | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| LagPort.macAddress          | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Ethernet Link Aggregation

The Ethernet Link Aggregation feature operation is observed with counters of the MO

instances representing Ethernet ports.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters Associated with Ethernet Link Aggregation

This feature has the same set of counters that is provided for the

EthernetPort MO class. In general, the counters for Ethernet

Link Aggregation is the sum of the counters for the individual links. The following

counters are associated with the feature:

- ifHCInBroadcastPkts
- ifHCInMulticastPkts
- ifHCInOctets
- ifHCInUcastPkts
- ifHCLossOfSignal
- ifHCOutBroadcastPkts
- ifHCOutMulticastPkts
- ifHCOutOctets
- ifHCOutUcastPkts
- ifInDiscards
- ifInErrors
- ifInOctetRatePercentiles
- ifInUnknownProtos
- ifInUnknownTags
- ifOutDiscards
- ifOutErrors
- ifOutOctetRatePercentiles

The following counters are not the sum of the counters for individual links:

- ifMaxLossOfSignalDuration
- ifMinLossOfSignalDuration
- ifTotalLossOfSignalDuration

These counters are used when the aggregated link is unavailable due to loss of signal

in all member links. To enable the performance management for this feature, they

need to be activated on the OSS side as well.

For the

supervision of E-RAN

traffic,

the following L2 counters show incorrect values:

- ifInUnknownTags
- ifInUnknownProtos
- ifHCOutUcastPkts

This applies only for the following units:

- Baseband 6641
- Baseband 6648
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Ethernet Link Aggregation

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the

FeatureState=CXC4040002 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Ethernet Link Aggregation

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

Set the attribute

featureState to DEACTIVATED in the

FeatureState=CXC4040002 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Ethernet Link Aggregation

There are no recommendations on the type of the Ethernet links that need LAG. The

deployment of this feature depends on the traffic load on the links between the particular

nodes.

If more than 1 Gbps is needed, a LAG with two 1 Gbps links can be a better choice than a

10 Gbps connection. 10 Gbps ports are not available and two 1 Gbps links have lower

total cost.

To be functional, configure LAG in both ends of the connection so that both endpoints are informed that link aggregation is used and which links are part of the LAG. All aggregated links must have the same properties for speed and duplex, which means that these properties cannot be set using Auto Negotiation.

CCTR can be activated for one week before and after the activation and deactivation of the feature. This ensures available troubleshooting data in case of any unexpected events. CCTR is activated in the OSS under Applications &gt; Ericsson &gt; Performance &gt; Initiate data collection &gt; WCDMA/LTE RAN Measurements section in order to enable the Data Collection Subscription Profiles which include Continuous Cell Trace Profiles.

## 9.1 Configure Ethernet Link Aggregation

The example commands of this procedure assume a hardware setup scenario where two 1

Gbps Ethernet links are aggregated, so they can be used as a single link.

Figure 2   Example Hardware Setup Scenario for Ethernet Link Aggregation

Prerequisites

- The feature is activated.
- LACP is configured on the Baseband radio node side.
- The additional cables from the Baseband radio node to the switch are available.
- The switch has free Ethernet ports and LACP is configured on the switch side.

Steps

1. Create a number of additional TnPort MO instances needed for the LAG. Example cr Equipment=1,FieldReplaceableUnit=1,TnPort=TN\_B
![Image](../images/292_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)
3. For each TnPort created, create an EthernetPort MO instance that encapsulates the previously created TnPort. Example crn Transport=1,EthernetPort=2 encapsulation Equipment=1,FieldReplaceableUnit=1,TnPort=TN\_B admOperatingMode 1 userLabel TN\_B end
![Image](../images/292_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)
5. Create a LagPort MO instance and encapsulate the previously created EthernetPort MO instances. Example crn Transport=1,LagPort=1 encapsulation Transport=1,EthernetPort=1 Transport=1,EthernetPort=2 userLabel 1,2 end
![Image](../images/292_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AX/additional_3_CP.png)

Results

The LAG is set up, and it is logically observed as a single Ethernet link.
