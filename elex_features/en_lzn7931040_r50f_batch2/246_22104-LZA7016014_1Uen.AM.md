# 1 Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover Overview

This feature improves network capacity and control over the traffic load by enabling

handover between FDD cells and TDD

cells.

Summary

The benefits of this feature are the following:

- Network capacity is maximized by ensuring that UEs are served by the best available cell.
- End-user interruption time is reduced when inter-mode handover is supported. When the feature is active, the UE does not have to go into idle mode or perform release with redirection when coverage is poor.
- Enhanced control over traffic load.
- Data rates to a UE within the network are maximized by using cells from TDD and FDD modes.
- Connected mode mobility within the network is possible. This ensures that minimal data flow interruptions occur during the handover process.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The UE must be capable of handling both inter-frequency and inter-mode handover. The following FGI bits must be checked: bit 25 indicates inter-frequency measurements support bit 13 indicates inter-frequency handover support bit 30 indicates inter-mode handover support.

# 3 Feature Operation of Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover

This feature enables handover scenarios between cells working in different LTE

modes.

This feature adds handover scenarios between cells working in the LTE FDD and the LTE TDD

modes to the following features:

- Automated Neighbor Relations
- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing

To enable the nodes to perform inter-mode handover, the

EUtranCellRelation MO of the FDD node must have a reference to

the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO, and the

EUtranCellRelation MO of the TDD node must have a reference to

the ExternalEUtranCellFDD MO.

# 4 Network Impact of Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover

This feature increases the network capacity when the UE uses cells from LTE TDD mode

and LTE FDD

mode.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhances network capacity when the UE uses cells from LTE TDD mode and

LTE FDD mode. Traffic on LTE TDD and LTE FDD cells can be distributed simultaneously

with the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature.

The feature extends inter-frequency UE mobility by allowing handover between LTE TDD

and LTE FDD cells. Mobility is also increased when session continuity can redirect

the UE to frequencies from different LTE modes.

The feature does not directly impact physical coverage, but when the coverage is

poor, the UE can be moved to other LTE modes if available.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover

The feature has no configuration parameters.

# 6 Performance of Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover

This feature has associated KPIs that relate to handovers and counters that are

stepped when an intra-LTE inter-mode handover

occurs.

Counters

The existing inter-frequency counters are stepped when the intra-LTE inter-mode

handover occurs. The following counters are affected:

- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSuccLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAttLteInterF
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSuccLteInterF

- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSuccLteInterFLb
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAttLteInterFLb
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSuccLteInterFLb

Events

When inter-mode handover occurs, existing handover PM events are tagged as

inter-frequency.
