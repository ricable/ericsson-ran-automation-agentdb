Summary

The Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT

Offload

feature configures suitable cell relations for WCDMA IRAT offload

automatically and dynamically. Automatic configuration is simpler and more efficient

than manual configuration in network deployments with several frequency layers and

different cell grids. Dynamic configuration of load management relations improves

load management efficiency.

By considering suitable targets and removing unsuitable targets, the load-balancing relation

list is optimized and used to determine the amount of traffic load that is handed

over to each target cell. Additional unsuitable target cells in the list reduce the

chance of using suitable targets. In addition, they might increase the number of

unnecessary UE measurements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload

This feature automatically and dynamically determines and configures the neighbor

relations that each source cell can use for WCDMA IRAT offload based on hit rate

estimation.

Hit Rate

Hit

rate

is the

likelihood of a UE candidate in the source cell to be qualified for WCDMA

offload

to a certain target cell.

Hit

rate

reflects

the target cell coverage with respect to the UE density and distribution in the source cell,

rather than the geographical overlap. Target cells that cover high-density areas in the

source cell are

more

suited for WCDMA IRAT offload than target cells that cover low-density

areas.

UE Measurements for Hit Rate Estimation

To estimate the hit rate value for each target cell, a number of UEs in the source cell are

required to perform measurements on the target frequencies. The same B1 measurements and

thresholds are used as in the Inter-RAT WCDMA Offload feature. For UTRAN frequency

relations, at least one cell relation must exist to allow the initiation of B1

measurements.

Measurements initiated for the Inter-RAT WCDMA Offload feature can be used to estimate the

hit rate. If the number of measurements is not high enough, additional measurements are

initiated to make the hit rate estimation more accurate.

Configuration of Best Neighbor Relations

To determine if WCDMA IRAT offload to a certain target cell is allowed, the hit rate for

each cell relation is compared to reference thresholds. If hit rate for a UTRAN neighbor

relation exceeds the value of the

LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranAddThreshold attribute, the

relation is considered suitable for load management.

The value of the UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing attribute is

automatically updated by the feature. Manual configuration of this attribute is overwritten

by the automatic configuration.

# 5 Network Impact of Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload

The feature affects throughput by introducing additional IRAT UE

measurements.

Capacity and Performance

The feature has the following impact on network performance:

- The feature introduces additional IRAT UE measurements, which require a measurement gap, depending on UE capability. If the number of UEs with a measurement gap increases, the data throughput is expected to decrease.
- The number of IRAT measurements increases. The number of extra measurements depends on the configured attributes for hit rate measurement intensity and the number of defined frequency layers.
- Signaling intensity is expected to increase because of the following reasons: Additional number of RRC reconfigurations to start and stop measurements on the UEs Increased number of received measurement reports

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload

Configuration of the feature affects how frequently load balancing relations are added

or removed.

The minimum time it takes to find suitable load balancing relations or remove unsuitable

relations depends on the following criteria:

- The configured value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranMeasUeIntensity attribute. If a high number of load management measurements are ongoing, load balancing relations are updated faster. This is because these measurements are also used for hit rate estimation. It is recommended to set the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranMeasUeIntensity attribute to a high value to find load balancing relations faster, especially in networks with non-co-located deployment. The value can be reduced afterward.
- The threshold to add or remove load balancing relations, configured in the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranAddThreshold attribute and the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranRemoveThreshold attribute respectively. It is recommended to have at least 5-10% difference between these thresholds. To add relations faster, the value of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranAddThreshold attribute can be reduced. To prevent the removal of load balancing relations, the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranRemoveThreshold attribute must be set to 0. If the Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature is operable, the Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload feature is able to give faster and more adaptive hit rate estimations. Depending on the configuration of the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranAddThreshold and the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranRemoveThreshold attributes, more frequent updates of the EUtranCellRelation.LoadBalancing attribute, including the corresponding AVC notifications, can be experienced. In this case, it is recommended to have at least 10% difference between the thresholds.
- The threshold for starting hit rate measurements, configured in the LoadBalancingFunction.lbHitRateUtranMeasUeThreshold attribute.
- The number of connected UEs and UE distribution in the source cell, and UE capabilities. If enough RRC-connected UEs exist in the source cell, it is expected that at least the first suitable target cell for load management is found within a few hours.
- The number of defined frequency relations with the UtranFreqRelation.lbBnrPolicy attribute set to OFFLOAD\_ONLY. If the attribute is set to NOT\_ALLOWED for a frequency relation, no UE measurements for hit rate estimation can be initiated on the frequency. If the attribute is set to OFFLOAD\_ONLY, UE measurements for hit rate estimation must be initiated on the frequency. If a high number of frequency relations for load management are defined, hit rate estimation pace can be reduced.
