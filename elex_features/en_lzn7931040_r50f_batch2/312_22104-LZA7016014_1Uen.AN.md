# 1 CS Fallback to CDMA 1X Overview

The CS Fallback to

CDMA 1X feature enables eNodeBs to respond to Circuit Switched

(CS) service requests from LTE UEs with single RX

configuration by a blind release with

redirecting

information. When an eNodeB receives a voice call request, it directs the UE to CDMA2000

1xRTT frequencies.

Summary

The primary CS service is

voice

traffic. CSFB is the only existing method that provides traditional voice services

for single radio

UEs,

unless

IMS

VoIP services are available.

For voice call requests, this feature supports the UE to be able to release from the LTE

network and connect to the neighboring CDMA2000 1xRTT with minimal disruption for

the end user.

This feature allows CDMA 1xRTT messages, including

SMS,

to be tunneled over the LTE network. Single radio UEs can handle SMS procedures

without having to fall back and get redirected to CDMA.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To

fully benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following network

elements:

- The MME must support the S102 interface, messages, and procedures for tunneling CDMA2000 information.
- The 1xCS IWS must support the S102 interface, messages, and CSFB procedures.

# 3 Feature Operation of CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

With

this feature, the UE can be released from LTE and connect to the neighboring CDMA2000 1xRTT with

minimal disruption to the end user.

Process Steps

The feature operates as follows:

1. Once the feature is enabled, the eNodeB broadcasts SIB8 messages to the UE containing 1xRTT CSFB registration information.
2. After the UE connects, the UE can initiate 1xRTT CS registration based on the SIB8 information received.
3. If 1xRTT CS registration is initiated, the UE sends a CSFB parameters request to the eNodeB.
4. The eNodeB sends the CSFB parameters to the UE at reception, the UE can send a registration request to the eNodeB.
5. The eNodeB tunnels the 1xRTT CS registration request in an uplink S1 CDMA2000 tunneling message to the MME.
6. The MME sends the 1xRTT CS registration response in a downlink S1 CDMA2000 tunneling message to the eNodeB which in turn sends it to the UE.
7. After the 1xRTT CS registration, the UE can go back to RRC\_IDLE mode or stay in RRC\_CONNECTED mode.

Making a Mobile Originating Call or Receiving a Mobile Terminating Call

The UE state must be RRC\_CONNECTED or RRC\_IDLE, and it

must be registered in 1xRTT to make a mobile originating call or receive a mobile

terminating call. The feature performs these processes by performing the following

steps:

1. The UE either performs a mobile operating CS call, or receives a mobile terminating CS call.
2. The UE sends a CSFB request by sending an extended service request over NAS to the MME. The UE requests the CSFB service either as a response to a user activity, or as a response to a paging message with a CSFB flag.
3. The eNodeB receives either an S1AP UE context modification request, or an S1AP UE context setup request that indicates that CSFB is required.
4. The eNodeB selects a frequency to perform the redirection. The selection is based on the following criteria:
    - UE capabilities
    - CSFB frequency priorities defined with the BandClassPrioCdma1xRtt.csFallbackPrio parameter for each available frequency relation. When several possible target frequencies have the same priority, the eNodeB applies a circular search scheme for the selection. Note: No measurements are ordered to determine what IRAT cells the UE can detect.
5. To initiate a blind connection release with redirection, the eNodeB directs the UE to the selected frequency.
6. The UE synchronizes with the new RAT and connects to the indicated target frequency.
7. The 1xRTT mobile originating or mobile terminating call is established.

# 4 Network Impact of CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

The implementation of this feature impacts paging and improves the end user

experience.

Capacity and Performance

Forcing the UE to initiate 1xRTT CS registration reduces the paging load, but if the registration

is not forced, the paging load increases with this feature.

Interfaces

The feature broadcasts SIB8 messages mapped to an SI message.

With this feature the UE initiates registration on the 1xRTT network over the S102

interface from the eNodeB.

Between the eNodeB and the MME, the 1xRTT CS registration requests and responses are sent

through the S1 interface.

Other Network Elements

The MME registers the UE on the CDMA 1xRTT network.

The UE sends a CSFB request by sending an extended service request over NAS to the MME

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- CDMA2000 1xRTT coverage must be provided in the area covered by the LTE cell.
- The LTE single radio UE must have CDMA2000 1xRTT capabilities.
- Cells must be configured to broadcast SIB8.
- EUtranCellFDD.initCdma2000SysTimeType or EUtranCellTDD.initCdma2000SysTimeType must be set to SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS.
- At least one defined frequency relation for mobility must be provided.
- The network is configured so that the CSFB returning UEs are routed to the correct MME. For more information, see MME Selection Algorithm in Radio Bearer Service.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011377 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any conflicting

feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011377 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for CS Fallback to CDMA 1X

To configure this feature it is important to follow these engineering guidelines

related to SIB8 and frequency relations.

SIB8 messages contain information and parameters required by the UE to perform 1xRTT CS

registration and idle mode reselection to the CDMA2000 1xRTT network. To ensure that

SIB8 is broadcast, it must be mapped to an SI message.

To ensure that system time is included in SIB8, the following conditions must apply:

- The ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment attribute must be set to TRUE.
- The value of clock accuracy must be lower than the threshold set in the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationCdma2000 attribute.

Frequency relation for mobility can be set in the

Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation MO class.

To configure redirection of the UE at reception of CSFB indication, information about the

CDMA2000 1xRTT carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during network

configuration. The carrier frequency information is sent to the UE during the

redirection process to assist the UE in finding the CDMA2000 1xRTT frequency. A

Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation and a corresponding

Cdma2000Freq MO instance must be created for each CDMA 1xRTT

frequency to which the UE can be redirected.

If the band class in the CSFBParametersResponseCDMA2000 message is same as

what the UE received in SIB8, the UE cannot initiate registration on the 1xRTT network

over the S102 interface. It is possible to force the UE to initiate 1xRTT CS

registration by sending a dummy value for the CDMA band class in the

CSFBParametersResponseCDMA2000 message. This is done by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.dummyCdmaBandClass or

EUtranCellTDD.dummyCdmaBandClass parameter to a dummy band

class             value that is not used in the native CDMA 1xRTT network and by setting the or

powerUpReg flag to True in SIB8.

If registration is not forced when the UE moves across LTE and CDMA 1xRTT, the UE has to

be paged in both networks for a given time until the UE performs the next registration

in the CDMA 1xRTT network. This increases the paging load. By forcing registration each

time the UE transitions between LTE and CDMA 1xRTT, the network knows where to reach the

UE thus reducing the paging load.

Benefits

Fallback direction is defined by a configurable parameter.  Based on the parameter

configuration, UEs from specific PLMNs are directed to CDMA or GERAN and UTRAN.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the PlmnInfo.actualPlmn and the

PlmnInfo.csfbTargetRat attributes for configuring the mapping

between PLMN and the domain for CSFB. These attributes must be set for all PLMNs

used in the eNodeB, otherwise the direction is set to GERAN and UTRAN for the not

configured PLMNs.

To benefit from this enhancement, the following features must be activated:

- CS Fallback to CDMA 1X
- CS Fallback to UTRAN and GERAN
- Shared LTE RAN

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.04 or later is required for this enhancement.
