# 1 SRVCC Handover to GERAN Overview

The feature enables the eNodeB to use handover to transfer UEs with voice bearers in

poor coverage from LTE to GERAN.

Summary

This feature is closely related to the SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature. The SRVCC Handover to

UTRAN and the SRVCC Handover to GERAN features use similar triggers (poor coverage)

and similar handover procedures. When these features are enabled, the criteria for

handover target RAT selection for voice bearers depend on the following data:

- Cell relation attribute setting
- Frequency priority
- Target cell radio link quality

The feature offers the following benefits:

- Enhanced control over how UEs with voice bearers are transferred between frequencies and cells.
- LTE VoIP session transition to the CS domain in a GERAN cell when poor coverage is detected in the serving LTE cell.
- Using handover to transfer the UE enables the target node to use different admission criteria than at a plain connection setup. This improves the probability that a service, for example VoIP, is not interrupted in a network with high load.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The network must have UEs with the capability to support SRVCC handover to GERAN. This is indicated by FGI bit 9 set to 1 in the UE-EUTRA-Capability IE in one of the following messages: The INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST S1 message described in 3GPP TS 36.413 The HANDOVER REQUEST S1/X2 message described in 3GPP TS 36.413 and 3GPP TS 36.423 The UECapabilityInformation RRC message described in 3GPP TS 36.331
- The MME must support SRVCC. The MME indicates this in the SRVCC operation possible IE in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST S1 message or in the HANDOVER REQUEST S1/X2 message. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.413 and 3GPP TS 36.423.
- At least one neighbor GERAN system must support the incoming IRAT handover SRVCC procedure.

# 3 Feature Operation of SRVCC Handover to GERAN

If poor coverage is detected, the eNodeB can use blind or measurement-based handover to

GERAN. The feature supports CS only and Dual Transfer Mode handovers. The SRVCC handover is

successful if all UE voice bearers are handed over.

Blind and Measurement-Based GERAN Handover

The feature uses the A2 measurement process to detect poor coverage in the

serving cell. This measurement process is enabled by the Coverage-Triggered GERAN

Session Continuity feature. At the reception of an A2 measurement report, the

eNodeB determines what frequencies in any RATs are target candidates for

transferring the UE.

At the detection of poor coverage in the source cell, a blind handover to GERAN is

triggered. For a successful blind handover to GERAN, all of the following conditions

must be met at the reception of an A2 measurement report:

- The UE must have at least one bearer with QCI=1. Note: In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.216, the MME only considers bearers with QCI=1 as voice bearers.
- The UE must support the GERAN measurement.
- A cell on the target GERAN frequency must be available that is known by the eNodeB to cover the source cell completely. This is indicated by the GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute.

If no target cell is available for a blind GERAN handover, the B2 measurement

is triggered in the UE. The B2 measurement determines if a cell in the GERAN

frequency group that covers the UE is available. If the B2 measurement report for

GERAN cells is received from the UE, an SRVCC handover to one of the reported cells

is triggered. This is referred to as measurement-based SRVCC handover to GERAN.

When the SRVCC handover procedure is started, the eNodeB notifies the MME that SRVCC

must be used. This is the case when a CS only handover is executed, and when the

target cell supports Dual Transfer Mode.

If no appropriate target GERAN cell is available for SRVCC handover, no specific cell

can be prepared in advance. In this case, the operator configuration decides if the

eNodeB performs the RwR action.

PS Bearers in SRVCC Handover to GERAN

PS handover to GERAN is not supported. If the SRVCC handover to GERAN is triggered

for the UE and the UE has PS bearers, the following solutions are used after the

SRVCC handover to GERAN CS domain is ended:

Outcome of SRVCC Handover to GERAN

The outcome of an SRVCC handover to GERAN depends on the successful transfer of the

UE voice bearers. If all the UE voice bearers are successfully handed over to the

target GERAN cell, the SRVCC handover is successful. Because the PS handover to

GERAN is not supported, the eNodeB does not consider the status of the PS

services.

If at least one of the UE voice bearers is not handed over to the target GERAN cell

successfully, the SRVCC handover fails.

Operational Process

The process steps of the SRVCC Handover to GERAN feature are the following:

1. The eNodeB configures an A2 measurement in the UE.
2. A2 measurement is triggered when the serving cell becomes worse than threshold.
3. The eNodeB receives the A2 measurement report from the UE
4. The eNodeB determines the set of candidate frequencies where the UE that has voice bearers can be transferred.
5. A frequency is selected as the target for the blind GERAN handover, if it fulfills all of the following requirements: The candidate frequency is a GERAN frequency. A cell is available on this frequency that fully covers the source cell. Handover to the candidate GERAN cell is allowed. If no candidate frequency can fulfill the requirements, an B2 measurement for the candidate GERAN frequency groups is configured in the UE.
6. When a B2 measurement report is received from the UE, the eNodeB investigates the reported cells and selects a target cell for the SRVCC handover.
7. When a target cell is selected for blind or measurement-based SRVCC handover, the eNodeB prepares and executes the handover attempt. In accordance with 3GPP TS 36.413, the handover preparation HANDOVER REQUIRED S1 message is sent with the following information: The events sent from the eNodeB during the SRVCC handover preparation contain information that confirms the handover type.
    - An indication in the SRVCC HO Indication IE that notifies the MME that SRVCC must be used.
    - The value of the SRVCC HO Indication IE is set to CS only to signal that CS only SRVCC handover is supported.
    - If the target cell does not support Dual Transfer Mode, the PS Service Not Available IE is also included.

# 4 Network Impact of SRVCC Handover to GERAN

This feature improves network capacity in poor coverage.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhances the

network capacity by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the

best available frequency or cell in the network.

The feature has no impact on the physical cell coverage. However, the feature

decreases the abnormal release number of UEs with VoIP service, which increases the

coverage enhanced for retainability.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

To use a GERAN cell as a target cell for the SRVCC handover, the following configuration

must be fulfilled in the eNodeB:

- A GeranCellRelation instance that references the ExternalGeranCell MO must exist under the GeranFreqGroupRelation MO in the serving cell.
- The ExternalGeranCell.lac attribute must be sent to the MME to identify the target MSC or SGSN that serves the target GERAN BSC.
- The ExternalGeranCell.dtmSupport attribute must be set according to the Dual Transfer Mode capability of the target cell. The value DTM\_SUPPORT means that the Routing Area Update procedure is triggered after the SRVCC handover to GERAN is finished. The value NO\_DTM\_SUPPORT means that the Suspend procedure is triggered after the SRVCC handover to GERAN is finished.

## 9.1 Configure for Blind SRVCC Handover to GERAN

Configurations are needed to indicate that blind handover must be used for a GERAN

target frequency. If no cell is available for blind handover, the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementActive attribute value determines the mobility

action.

After the eNodeB selects a GERAN frequency group as a candidate target, the eNodeB checks if

the UE must make a blind handover to the target cell. If blind handover is not possible, B2

measurement must be started in the UE.

To indicate that blind handover must be used for the target cell, the following configuration

must be fulfilled:

- The EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute must be set to TRUE in the serving cell.
- The GeranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute must be set to COVERS.
- The value of the GeranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute must be set to TRUE.
- The available member of the GeranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to TRUE.

The UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementActive attribute is not required to be set

to FALSE for blind SRVCC handover. If no cell relations can be used for blind

handover, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementActive attribute is used to

determine the mobility action.

## 9.2 Configure for Measurement-Based SRVCC Handover to GERAN

Configurations are needed to indicate that measurement-based handover must be used for

a GERAN target frequency.

If no cell relation is available for blind handover, measurement-based SRVCC handover to

GERAN is triggered.

To indicate that measurement-based SRVCC handover must be used for the target GERAN cell, the

following configuration must be fulfilled:

- The UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementActive attribute must be set to TRUE.
- The value of the GeranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute must be set to TRUE.
- The available member of the GeranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to TRUE.

If the received B2 measurement report only contains cells to which SRVCC handover is not allowed,

the eNodeB cannot select measurement-based SRVCC handover as mobility method. If the reported

cells do not exist in the MOM or have no cell relation from the source cell, measurement-based

handover cannot be selected. In these cases, the eNodeB can react the following ways:

- If the feature is enabled, nothing is done until the UE is back in good coverage or the UE is dropped during poor coverage.
- If the feature is disabled and the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is set to TRUE, RwR is triggered.
