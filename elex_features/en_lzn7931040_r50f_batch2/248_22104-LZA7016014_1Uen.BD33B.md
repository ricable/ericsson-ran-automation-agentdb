Summary

The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature is used in multi-carrier networks to ensure that UEs in

idle or connected mode are on the right carrier to receive accurate MBMS

service.

This feature supports the UE so it can move to or stay on a

carrier

that broadcasts an MBMS service in which the user is

interested.

In this feature, the eNodeB supports MBMS service acquisition by notifying all UEs about the

availability of specific MBMS service areas for each carrier in System Information

Block type 15 (SIB15). Inter-frequency handover is done to

support

the MBMS service acquisition by a UE in connected mode after it

sends an MBMS interest indication message to the network. The feature also ensures

MBMS service continuity by preventing inter-frequency handover because of load

balancing.

# 3 Feature Operation of MBMS Multi-Carrier Support

The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature uses SIB15 to broadcast the active MBMS Service

Area Identities.

System Information Block Type 15 (SIB15)

SIB15 broadcasts the active MBMS SAIs of the current cell and neighbor cells on other

carrier frequencies. The serviceAreaId attribute is configured in

MO MbsfnArea and the EUtranCellFDD is

connected to the MbsfnArea by the MO

MbsfnAreaCellRelation. Active SAIs are stored in the

activeServiceAreaId parameter on the

EUtranCellFDD MO when the following conditions are met:

- The cell is referenced by MbsfnAreaCellRelation.isReservedCell set to false.
- The related MbsfnArea MO is in administrative state UNLOCKED.
- The license for the MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature is activated.

Information about the active SAIs used for eMBMS is distributed between eNodeBs in

the following messages:

- X2 SETUP REQUEST
- X2 SETUP RESPONSE
- ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE X2

The information is stored in the

ExternalEUtranCellFDD.activeServiceAreaId attribute, which

can be manually configured by the operator.

The following fields are included in SIB15:

- mbms-SAI-IntraFreq: activeServiceAreaId in EUtranCellFDD MO for the source cell only.
- mbms-SAI-InterFreqList: activeServiceAreaId in EUtranCellFDD or ExternalEUtranCellFDD.
- multiBandInfoList: additionalFreqBandList in EUtranCellFDD or ExternalEUtranCellFDD. For more information about the additional frequency bands and how they are stored in MOM, see Multiple Frequency Band Indicators.

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331 version 11.4.0.

Figure 1 shows an example of the Service

Area Identities to be broadcast in SIB15 from different cells on different

eNodeBs.

- Cell 1 has active SAI 10 and SAI 11 which are sent in mbms-SAI-IntraFreq. Cell 1 has cell relations to Cell 2 and Cell 3. Since Cell 3 is on the same frequency as Cell 1, active SAIs on Cell 3 are not sent out in SIB15 by Cell 1. Cell 2 is on another frequency than Cell 1, so active SAIs on Cell 2 (SAI 10, 11) is sent out in mbms-SAI-InterFreqList by Cell 1.
- Cell 2 has active SAI 20 which is sent in mbms-SAI-IntraFreq. Cell 2 has cell relations to Cell 1, Cell 3, and Cell 4, but only Cell 1 and Cell 3 are on another frequency than Cell 2, so Cell 2 creates a union of the active SAIs on Cell 1 and Cell 3 (SAI 10, 11 and 12) and send it in the mbms-SAI-InterFreqList .
- Cell 3 has active SAI 11 and SAI 12 which are sent in mbms-SAI-IntraFreq. Cell 3 has cell relations to Cell 1, Cell 2, and Cell 4. Cell 4 is an MBSFN area reserved cell and consequently has no active SAI. Cell 3 receives the SAI information from Cell 2 (SAI 20) and sends the information in the mbms-SAI-InterFreqList.
- Cell 4 does not send any information in mbms-SAI-IntraFreq since it is an MBSFN area reserved cell. Cell 4 has cell relations to Cell 2 and Cell 3 but only includes active SAI on Cell 3 (SAI 11 and 12) in the mbms-SAI-InterFreqList since Cell 2 is on the same frequency as Cell 4.

Figure 1   Two Frequency Layers, SAIs - UE Mobility

Prerequisites for broadcasting SIB15:

- The license for the MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature is activated.
- The mappingInfoSIB15 member of the MappingInfoSIBs is set..
- At least one entry is configured in the EUtranCellFDD.activeServiceAreaId attribute of the source cell, the cell from which SIB15 is sent, or on an ExternalEUtranCell on another frequency to which the source cell has an EUtranCellRelation.

Idle Mode

The UE reads SIB 15 and acts according to 3GPP TS

36.304.

Connected Mode

An eMBMS-capable UE which is already connected with eNodeB and is in

RRC\_CONNECTED state can initiate the MBMS interest

indication procedure as outlined in struct is set to map SIB15 to the desired SI

message. Locking and unlocking the cell must be applied for the changes to take

effect. 3GPP 36.331 5.8.5 to inform the network about its

interest to receive LTE Broadcast.

When an MBMSInterestIndication message is received from a UE,

the eNodeB performs one of the following actions depending on the MBMS frequency of

interest received in the message.

- If the first MBMS frequency of interest in the MBMSInterestIndication message matches the current serving frequency of EUtranCell, the eNodeB does not consider using the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing action for this UE.

Figure 2   E2E Message Sequence at MBMSInterestIndication Reception

- If the first MBMS frequency of interest in the MBMSInterestIndication message does not match the current frequency of EUtranCell and if UE is capable of MBMS on SCell ( mbms-SCell-r11 = 1, 3GPP 36.331) then the eNodeB tries to set up an SCell with the MBMSInterestIndication frequency. The eNodeB is not use the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing action for MBMS on SCell capable UEs ( mbms-SCell-r11 = 1, 3GPP 36.331). If it is not possible to set up an SCell with the MBMS InterestIndication frequency or the UE is not capable of MBMS on SCell, see Figure 2. For an outline of the message sequence from the UE initiating interest indication and moving the UE to its preferred carrier. The eNodeB initiates the Intra-LTE Inter-Frequency HO procedure. The eNodeB configures the UE with eventA5 to find a suitable cell on the required frequency. The operator is only able to configure hysteresis and threshold values through the ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqMbms.a5ThresholdRsrp and ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqMbms.hysteresisA5 MO. All other A5-related measurement configuration uses internally-defined system constants. The UE is to perform an Inter-Frequency A5 measurement on the target frequency. When the UE finds the cell or cells that satisfy the A5 reporting criteria, it sends the measurement report to the eNodeB. When the eNodeB receives a measurement report, it initiates the inter-frequency Handover (HO) procedure. Sends an HO Preparation Message to the target cell. The MBMS frequency of interest received from the UE is also sent to the target in AS-Context mbmsInterestIndication. The target cell sends an HO command to the UE through the source cell. The UE performs HO to the target cell. The eNodeB does not consider this UE for Inter-Frequency Load Balancing action on the target carrier.
- If the MBMSInterestIndication message contains an empty frequency list, the eNodeB reconsiders this UE for an Inter-Frequency Load Balancing action.

# 5 Network Impact of MBMS Multi-Carrier Support

The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature increases the number of inter-frequency

handovers.

Capacity and Performance

The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature relies on UE inter-frequency measurements. The

Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling associated with inter-frequency measurements

and the handover-related signaling can increase.

Interfaces

The MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature redistributes users in connected mode between

inter-frequency cells by inter-frequency handover. The number of inter-frequency

handovers increases with this feature. Handover is typically performed in good radio

conditions. For X2 handover, the handover cause value is set to radioNetwork:

handover desirable for radio reasons. For S1 handover, radioNetwork: s1 intra-system

handover is triggered. The pmHoPrepAttLteInterFMbms,

pmHoPrepSuccLteInterFMbms,

pmHoExeAttLteInterFMbms, and

pmHoExeSuccLteInterFMbms counters are introduced to

distinguish MBMS interest triggered handover from other types of inter-frequency

handover.

# 6 Performance of MBMS Multi-Carrier Support

The feature is associated with the mobility success

rate.

# 7 Activate the MBMS Multi-Carrier Support

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

- The license for the MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature must be activated.
- Configuration of LTE RAN to prepare for LTE Broadcast. A certain eNodeB does not need to be involved in the actual eMBMS broadcast to run the MBMS Multi-Carrier Support feature.
- Other nodes, such as MME, MBMS GW and BM-SC are ready to run LTE Broadcast. These nodes are not LTE RAN nodes therefore they are not included in LTE RAN CPI.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011558 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate the MBMS Multi-Carrier Support

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature

deactivation procedure.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011558 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
