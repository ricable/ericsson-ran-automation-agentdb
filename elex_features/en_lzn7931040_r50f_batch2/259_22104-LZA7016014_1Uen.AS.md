Summary

LTE Broadcast reception requires accurate system clock setting in the UE.

The SIB16 Time Information Broadcast creates a single source of information for accurate local

time provisioning in the UE.

For FDD only, the feature creates a common reference time for the UE.

# 3 Feature Operation of SIB16 Time Information Broadcast

The SIB16 Time Information Broadcast feature provides accurate time until the deviation

exceeds the limit of the System Information Block Type 16 (SIB16) broadcast.

SIB16 contains the following IEs:

| timeInfoUTC        |    | The timeInfoUTC IE contains the UTC. It is calculated by the                         eNodeB based on GPS Time from a GNSS device, or International Atomic Time                         from PTPv2 protocol (IEEE 1588v2).   |
|--------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| dayLightSavingTime |    | The dayLightSavingTime IE contains any daylight saving time                         currently applied.                                                                                                                      |
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| leapSeconds        |    | The leapSeconds IE contains the number of leap seconds between                         UTC and GPS Time.                                                                                                                    |
|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| localTimeOffset    |    | The localTimeOffset IE contains the difference between local                         time and UTC.                                                                                                                          |

The eNodeB calculates the UTC time value from GPS Time or International Atomic Time, and

the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds and

TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameters in the

following way:

- If the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameter is empty or equal to a date in the future: timeInfoUTC = GPS Time - TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds leapSeconds = TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds

- In case the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameter has a positive value from the past: timeInfoUTC = GPS Time - (TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds + 1) leapSeconds = TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds + 1

- In case the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameter has a negative value (contains a 'minus' sign) from the past: timeInfoUTC = GPS Time - (TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds - 1) leapSeconds = TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds - 1

The dayLightSavingTime IE is set by the eNodeB based on the following

parameters:

- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeStartDate
- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeEndDate
- TimeSettings.daylightSavingTimeOffset

The localTimeOffset IE is the value of the

TimeSettings.timeOffset parameter divided by 15 rounded down to

the nearest integer if the following conditions apply:

- The range of localTimeoffset IE in SIB16 is (-63,64).
- The TimeSettings.timeOffset parameter is in range of (-15:59, 16:14).

The supervision of precision time is handled by the

ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationSib16 parameter. When

synchronization source is lost, and the time and phase deviation exceeds the limit set

by the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationSib16 parameter, the SIB16

broadcast is stopped and the Service Degraded alarm is raised in the cell.

SIB16 broadcast status is shown by the read-only

EnodeBFunction.timePhaseSynchStateSib16 parameter, which is set

to false if the broadcast of SIB16 is not possible.

## 3.1 Updating the leapSeconds IE

The eNodeB can only calculate UTC correctly if the

TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds parameter value is not empty. This

value is broadcast as the leapSeconds IE.

The TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds parameter needs to be updated

based on Bulletin C published by the International Earth Rotation and Reference System

Service (IERS) on the IERS site. This information is also sent to customers in the

Ericsson Alert Bulletin through Global Online Support (GOLS).

Bulletin C is published every 6 months, in January and July. It contains instructions

whether leap seconds must be added or removed to set the correct UTC value.

The difference between UTC and International Atomic Time or GPS Time can change, and it

is determined by IERS in Bulletin C. The difference between International Atomic Time

and GPS Time is always 19 seconds. Based on these pieces of information, it is possible

to calculate the value of the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds

parameter. Use the following formula:

gpsToUtcLeapSeconds =

-(BulletinC\_UTC\_to\_TAI) - 19

For example, if the time difference between UTC to International Atomic Time is

-37:

gpsToUtcLeapSeconds = - (-37) - 19 = 18

seconds

Bulletin C also contains instructions about the date of the leap second change, which

must be set before this date in the

TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameter. The eNodeB

adjusts UTC on this date by the set value.

After the leap seconds change date, the

TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds and

TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameters are not

updated automatically. It is recommended to clear them in the following way:

1. Update the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds parameter to the new value.
2. Clear the date in the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate parameter.

# 7 Activate SIB16 Time Information Broadcast

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- For TDD, the Clock Source over GPS must be activated. For FDD, the Clock Source over GPS , or IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization must be activated.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011618 MO instance.
2. Set the ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment parameter to true and the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationSib16 parameter to the desired value.
3. Set all members of the EUtranCellFDD.frameStartOffset and the EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset parameter to 0.
4. Set the mappingInfoSIBs struct associated with EUtranCellFDD.mappingInfo or EUtranCellTDD.mappingInfo parameter to the desired SI message. Note: SIB8 and SIB16 cannot be mapped to the same SI message. For more information, see Radio Network Configuration or Manage Radio Network.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate SIB16 Time Information Broadcast

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011618 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
