# 3 Feature Operation of Quad Antenna Uplink Performance Package

The Quad Antenna Uplink Performance

Package feature supports the same behavior as a 2-way receiver diversity.

4-way receiver diversity supports the same behavior as 2-way receiver diversity but with

better performance.

Baseband Configuration

A Baseband unit provides switching, traffic management, timing, baseband processing,

and radio interfacing.

For cell configuration limitations with different types of Baseband units for this

feature, see Radio Node Configurations, or see Manage Radio Network and Manage Bearers and Services for Baseband radio

nodes.

The following documents provide further information about Baseband configuration:

- Baseband Description
- Control Channel Dimensioning

Receiver Antenna Configuration

The following antenna types and configurations can be used for 4-way receiver

diversity:

- Four co-polarized correlated antenna elements
- Four co-polarized uncorrelated antenna elements
- Two columns of closely spaced cross-polarized antenna elements
- Two spatially separated columns of cross-polarized antenna elements

Figure 1   Antenna Configurations for 4-way Receiver Diversity

Uncorrelated antennas give better uplink performance. Four co-polarized uncorrelated

antenna elements and two spatially separated columns of cross-polarized antennas

give the best performance.

IRC generally improves the performance when 4-way RX diversity is used. When the IRC

feature is activated, the system dynamically switches between the combining methods

IRC and MRC, depending on interference situation. Without an IRC license key, MRC is

used in all situations.

For further information about antenna configurations, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

|------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas | Affected | A parameter value of 0 results in that the optional features enabling                                 usage of RX antennas defines the configuration, and available                                 resources will be used accordingly. If set to 0, and the optional                                 features enabling usage of RX antennas are deactivated, the                                 predefined value for the number of RX antennas is 2. |

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Quad Antenna Uplink Performance Package

Radio Building Block Configurations

An RBB defines a unique way of combining internal radio or external radio in one

sector with connections to Baseband units and the antenna system.

For the RBB configurations that support 4-way receiver diversity, see Radio Node Configurations; for the cabling configurations, see

Radio Connections.

The corresponding RfBranch.rfBranchId attribute must end with the

\_No\_TX string, if one of the following conditions apply:

- An RF branch is not used for TX
- An RX only internal radio is configured

The value of the RfBranch.RfBranchId attribute is defined using

site equipment files during integration. For more information, see Manage Configuration Files.
