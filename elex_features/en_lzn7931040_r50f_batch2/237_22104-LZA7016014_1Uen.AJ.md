# 1 Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation Overview

The Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation feature increases throughput by

limiting the CRS interference. The feature supports the manual configuration of the CRS

assistance information of neighbor cells, which UEs use to reduce the CRS

interference.

Summary

The Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation feature allows for the manual

configuration of the CRS assistance information of neighbor cells. The eNodeB provides this

information to the UEs so they can limit the CRS interference. The reduction of CRS

interference increases downlink throughput for UEs on the borders of the cells during low

and medium load.

The CRS assistance information includes the following information:

- Physical c`ell ID
- Number of antenna ports (1, 2, 4)
- MBSFN subframe configuration

# 3 Feature Operation of Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation

The CRS assistance information must be configured for the UE to be able to perform CRS

interference cancellation.

The Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation feature requires time and phase

synchronization since the current UEs only support CRS interference cancellation in

synchronized networks.

The Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation works the following way:

1. The Operator configures the CRS assistance information of the neighbor cells and activates the feature.
2. The eNodeB sends the UE the CRS assistance information, when the UE that is capable of CRS interference cancellation connects.
3. The UE performs the CRS interference cancellation.

The RRC Connection Reconfiguration message sends the following CRS assistance

information:

- Initial context setup
- Incoming handover
- RRC connection re-establishment

# 4 Network Impact of Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation

When the Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation feature is activated, the

target cell sends the CRS assistance information about the neighboring cells to the source cell.

The source cell sends it to the UEs, with full configuration during UE handover.

Capacity and Performance

Mobility success rate is marginally decreased because full configuration signalling is

increased during UE handover.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

Reduced CRS interference increases cell edge downlink throughput for the UE when the load

is medium or low.

# 5 Parameters for Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation

The Network-Assisted CRS Interference Cancellation feature introduces parameters to

configure the feature operation. Existing parameters affect the feature operation.
