# 1 Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring Overview

This feature offers high accuracy round-trip delay measurements for each remote GTP-U

IP address, down to microsecond accuracy.

Summary

The Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring feature gives the operator an overview

of the IP network performance for each end-to-end X2UP connection.

Benefits

The Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring feature enables high accuracy

round-trip delay measurements for each remote GTP-U IP address on the eNodeB by

adding a private extension with a time stamp to the GTP-U echo messages.  X2UP delay

KPIs are provided for each eNodeB termination point.

Additional Information

More information about this feature and related topics can be found in the following

documentation:

# 2 Dependencies of Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

The GTP-U Supervision feature acts as echo responder for this feature. X2 IP address

separation is supported only for Baseband Radio Nodes.

Feature Dependencies

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

For advanced measurements, the remote GTP-U node must support Ericsson Private

Extension in the GTP-U echo responder.

For Baseband Radio Nodes, this feature supports X2 IP address separation between the

control plane and the user plane. IP address separation means that the X2 control

plane and X2 user plane have different IP addresses. If the feature is enabled, X2

peers with IP address separation are

monitored.

# 3 Feature Operation of Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

This feature monitors X2 peers with GTP-U echo request messages.

Feature Operation Specific to Baseband Radio Node

The feature includes the following functions:

- Addition of Ericsson Private Extension to echo request messages that originate in GTP-U
- Analysis of data received with GTP-U echo response messages

For each peer that supports the Ericsson GTP-U echo responder function,

advanced measurements are provided. Advanced measurements include counters for

round-trip delay and forward PDV.

The GTP-U originator must be enabled for the wanted peer type.

# 4 Network Impact of Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

The implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.

# 5 Parameters for Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

This feature introduces configuration attributes.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                       | Type       | Description          |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| ENodeBFunction.x2GtpuEchoEnable | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| ENodeBFunction.x2GtpuEchoDscp   | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

This feature uses round-trip delay and PDV counters.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following PM counters are available for this feature on Baseband Radio Node:

- GtpPath.pmPDVFwd99p
- GtpPath.pmPDVFwdAvg
- GtpPath.pmPDVFwdMax
- GtpPath.pmRTDAvg
- GtpPath.pmRTD99p
- GtpPath.pmRTDMax
- GtpPath.pmRTDMin

The node sets the values of the round-trip delay (RTD) and PDV counters in the

following way:

1. Initially, the counter is set to a value of -2.
2. Once the node detects that the GTP peer supports Ericsson Private Extension in GTP echo messages, the counter value starts incrementing from a value of 0.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012022 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Transport Path Characteristics Monitoring

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED on the FeatureState=CXC4012022 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
