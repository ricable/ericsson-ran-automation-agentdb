# 1 Dynamic Load Control Overview

This feature improves throughput and retainability in congested cells by gradually

adjusting the admitted traffic.

Summary

The Dynamic Load Control feature improves throughput and retainability in congested

cells by gradually adjusting the admitted traffic.

This can also improve accessibility, whereas the Procedure Latency Supervision

function of the Basic Load Management feature completely blocks all traffic.

Privileged access, such as EA and HPA, are always allowed to connect, regardless of

the Dynamic Load Control feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

This feature has no prerequisite network configuration requirements.

Affected System Functions

When the Dynamic Load Control feature acts in overload situations, incoming handovers

and initial establishment can be rejected.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dynamic Load Control

The Dynamic Load Control feature gradually reduces the allowed number of incoming

handovers and initial establishments. This happens when the air interface procedure latency

or the UE drop rate measurements, or both, become degraded.

In a cell, where the Category M Access feature is enabled, the procedure latency and the

UE drop rate generated by Cat-M1 UEs are excluded from the measurement.

Once activated, the feature reacts only when the RRC signal intensity or the incoming

handover intensity, or both, are above a certain threshold.

When the measurements go back to normal levels, the allowed number of incoming handovers

and initial establishments is gradually increased up to the maximum limit.

Dynamic Load Control

Figure 1   Overview of Dynamic Load Control

Dynamic Load Control operates for each cell and acts on the following input:

- RRC procedure latency A number of RRC procedures are time-supervised and statistics of the measured time of these procedures are collected. The supervised RRC procedures are the following: Security mode setup UE capability enquiry Connection reconfiguration Connection setup The RRC UE capability enquiry procedure measures the time between the UECapabilityEnquiry and the UECapabilityInformation messages. When the UE performs message segmentation, the additional messages and the reassembly of the segments increase the time between the two messages. This results in higher median latency. Therefore, when message segmentation takes place, the latency is measured between the UECapabilityEnquiry and the first UlDedicatedMessageSegment messages.
- UE drop rate A number of release causes are monitored and the ratio between abnormal and total releases is supervised. The supervised UE release causes are the following: Radio Link Control failure for Signaling Radio Bearer Radio Link Control failure for Data Radio Bearer Physical downlink Control Channel uplink synchronization failure Time alignment timer expiry Hybrid automatic repeat request timeout Lack of Signaling Radio Bearer resources Lack of Data Radio Bearer resources RRC configuration timeout Radio connection with UE lost (S1 release cause)
- New, Modified and Released UE connection intensity A number of connection procedures are monitored regarding intensity. The monitored procedures are the following: RRC connection setup RRC connection reconfiguration RRC connection release X2 handover request S1 handover request

For normal calls, the connections are accepted as long as the connection intensity in

a cell is below or equal to the maximum number of allowed connections for the

current period. Otherwise, the connection is rejected. For each initial

establishment rejection, a randomized back-off time is used.

Cell Connection Intensity Window

The Dynamic Load Control feature gradually regulates the number of allowed

connections depending on the Cell Connection Intensity Window (CCIW) input

parameters. It only regulates the allowed traffic once the combined RRC procedure

latency and UE drop rate thresholds are reached.

Figure 2   Overview of Cell Connection Intensity Supervision

Figure 3   Cell Connection Intensity Window

The operation is accepted as long as the connection intensity in a cell is below or

equal to the maximum number of allowed connections for the current period. Otherwise

the connection is rejected. For each Initial Establishment rejection a randomized

back-off time is used.

Privileged access, such as HPA and EA, are accepted at all times, regardless of cell

connection intensity.

# 4 Network Impact of Dynamic Load Control

Dynamic Load Control temporarily reduces the allowed incoming traffic in cells with poor

radio or high utilization to protect the user experience of admitted users.

Capacity and Performance

For cells with poor radio or high utilization or both, the Dynamic Load Control

feature protects the user experience of the admitted users by gradually reducing the

allowed incoming traffic. This momentarily reduces the maximum capacity regarding

the number of connected users and can impact the KPI for accessibility.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Dynamic Load Control

This section describes parameters introduced by the Dynamic Load Control feature. The

implementation of this feature affects no parameters.

Table 2   Parameters

# 6 Performance of Dynamic Load Control

This feature improves retainability for cells with a highly loaded air

interface.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) but improves

retainability and throughput KPIs for cells with a highly loaded air interface. In

certain situations it can degrade the accessibility KPI.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q4: Procedure Latency Supervision and Dynamic Load Control Improvements for Category M

This feature excludes both the procedure latency and the UE drop rate generated by

Category M1 UEs from Procedure Latency Supervision and Dynamic Load Control. If the number

of Category M1 UEs that are trying to connect exceeds the system capacity, additional

Category M1 UEs are treated as LTE UEs without privilege access.

The number of Category M1 UEs that can connect is determined by the system capacity. If more

Category M1 UEs try to connect, they are rejected and treated as LTE UEs without

privilege access. These rejections trigger Dynamic UE Admission Control if the Dynamic

UE Admission Control thresholds are reached.

For information on current capacity figures, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and

Massive IoT RAN.

Benefits

The improvement provides the following benefits:

- Emergency calls and services with high priority access are not rejected by the overload protection mechanism of the Procedure Latency Supervision feature.
- Exclusion of both the procedure latency and the UE drop rate generated by Category M1 UEs from Procedure Latency Supervision and Dynamic Load Control.

Capacity and Performance

Since emergency and high priority access calls are accepted in overload situations, a minor

increase in accessibility is detected. When the Category M1 UEs do not incorrectly

trigger overload, an overall increase in accessibility is achieved.
