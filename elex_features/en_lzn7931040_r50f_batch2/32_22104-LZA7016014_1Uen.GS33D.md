# 1 Carrier Aggregation Overview

The Carrier Aggregation feature enables data to be transmitted to a UE on two carriers

simultaneously.

Summary

The Carrier Aggregation feature has the following benefits:

- Increased downlink speed across the coverage area
- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum
- Higher capacity

The Carrier Aggregation feature supports the following characteristics:

- Up to two downlink component carriers
- Statically configured secondary component carrier
- Mixed transmission mode supported between carriers
- Same downlink and uplink subframe configuration for aggregated TDD carriers
- Dynamic activation or deactivation of the secondary component carrier
- No cross-carrier scheduling
- Inter-band aggregation
- Contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation between TDD carriers and between FDD carriers
- Non-contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation for FDD and TDD carriers
- Intra- and inter-LTE mobility

A UE configured for carrier aggregation has one PCell and one SCell. The PCell is the cell

where the UE is connected, has established the RRC connection, and is operating on the

primary frequency. The SCell operates on a secondary frequency and can be configured once

the RRC connection is established.

If the Cell Sleep Mode feature is active, it can affect the Carrier Aggregation feature.

If, for example, all SCell candidates are capacity cells that have sleep mode enabled, the

carrier aggregation capability is disabled when all capacity cells enter sleep mode. Also,

if the PCell is a capacity cell with sleep mode enabled, the carrier aggregation capability

of a UE ends as the UE moves out of the cell when the cell enters sleep mode.

The peak downlink UE throughput depends on the following

factors:

- Number and bandwidth of the component carriers
- Number of MIMO layers for each component carrier
- Frame structure type (FDD, TDD, or LAA)
- Modulation scheme (256 QAM or 64 QAM)
- Node hardware

For more information on these factors, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

For 3GPP Release 13 and later UEs, the node supports Size Reduction of UECapabilityInformation Message.

## 3.1 Bandwidths Supported by Carrier Aggregation

Bandwidth support for Carrier Aggregation

can be up to an aggregated bandwidth of 40 MHz. For specific bandwidth

combinations per band combination, see 3GPP TS 36.101.

## 3.2 Inter-Band Aggregation

The Carrier Aggregation feature supports inter-band aggregation,

that is, carriers on different frequency bands, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Inter-Band Carrier Aggregation

## 3.3 Intra-Band Aggregation

The Carrier Aggregation feature supports intra-band aggregation,

that is, carriers on the same frequency band.

### 3.3.1 Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

For contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation, the carriers are

located next to one another in the same band and are allocated with

a defined nominal channel spacing between their middle frequencies.

The eNodeB allows a channel spacing less than the nominal channel spacing according to

3GPP TS 36.101, but with the consequence of increased interference between the

carriers. If channel spacing is equal to or less than nominal channel spacing, the eNodeB

considers carriers for contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation.

If channel spacing is larger than nominal spacing, the eNodeB considers the carriers for

non-contiguous carrier aggregation.

Figure 2   Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

### 3.3.2 Non-Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

For non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the carriers are located

within the same band with some spectrum of uncoordinated operation

between them, for example spectrum owned by another operator.

Figure 3   Non-Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

## 3.4 Secondary Cell Configuration

The operator designates which cells are aggregated for the Carrier Aggregation (CA) UE, by

setting a cell as the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD

PCell and another as the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD

SCell.

If the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation feature is activated, several

EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD instances can be used

as SCell candidates for the CA UE. If there are more than one SCell candidates, the eNodeB

selects the initial SCell from the list of candidates. The eNodeB is later able to switch to

another SCell or even remove all SCells if no suitable cell is available. For more

information, see Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation.

To configure the CA UE, the operator must also set the sCellCandidate

attribute for the SCell.

At attach during reestablishment and incoming handover for either inter- or intra-frequency,

the eNodeB checks the following conditions:

- The CA license
- The CA neighbor cell configuration, that is, the SCell candidate
- The UE capability

If all conditions are fulfilled, the CA UE is configured with one downlink SCell in the same

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message that is required for the attach or

outgoing handover reconfiguration to be complete.

If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled and the

EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or the

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall attribute is set to

DECONF\_SCELLS, all SCells that were deconfigured when a VoLTE or PTT voice

bearer was established are reconfigured for the UE. This happens at the time of voice bearer

release. For more information, see VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation.

## 3.5 Secondary Cell Deconfiguration

The SCell is always deconfigured at incoming handover.

When the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled and the MOM attribute

EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or

EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to

DECONF\_SCELLS, all SCells which have been configured for the UE and

measurements related to CA and SCells are deconfigured during an active voice bearer service

(VoLTE or PTT).

## 3.6 Dynamic Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation

To facilitate UE battery saving, the Carrier Aggregation feature

supports SCell dynamic activation and deactivation.

DL transmissions on an SCell are only possible if it is activated.

If it is deactivated although still configured, no transmissions are

possible on that carrier. The UE does not monitor the deactivated

component carrier. This results in UE battery saving.

Dynamic activation and deactivation ensures that the SCell is only

activated when there is DL data demand that could benefit from transmitting

on more than just one carrier. Furthermore, the activated SCell is

only used for DL transmissions if the SCell DL channel quality is

above a certain threshold. The SCell is deactivated either if the

DL data demand drops to such an extent that it can be handled through

only one component carrier, or when the DL channel quality of the

activated SCell stays below a  threshold for a certain

time.

To avoid a ping-pong effect of activation or deactivation, a timer

is started whenever a state change from deactivated to activated or

from activated to deactivated is triggered. No new state change is

allowed until the timer expires.

Parameters for Carrier Aggregation

### 3.6.1 Secondary Cell Activation or Deactivation Triggers

The following conditions must be met so that SCell activation or

deactivation can take place:

- Need-based: Allow activation or deactivation of the SCell based on the amount of data available in the Radio Link Control (RLC) buffer.

- Coverage-based: Allow deactivation of the SCell based on poor channel quality. Note: SCells are activated as soon as possible without checking activation conditions when UE is initially configured with one or more SCells. An activated SCell is only used for transmission if it has good channel quality.

- Prohibit Timer: To avoid a ping-pong effect, allow activation or deactivation of the SCell if the timer is not running. The prohibit timer must be started whenever either activation or deactivation is triggered. No new activation or deactivation can be triggered while the timer is running.

### 3.6.2 Secondary Cell Activation

An SCell can be activated after successful configuration by means of an RRC Reconfiguration

if the trigger conditions are met. See Secondary Cell Activation or Deactivation Triggers. More than one SCell

can be activated at once if the trigger conditions are met. The number of simultaneously

activated SCells is based on the current data size in the UE buffer, and the capacity of

aggregated cells. In a high-burst traffic environment the number of SCells activated based on

current data level might not be sufficient. To cope with the traffic increase, one more SCell

is pre-activated if a need-based activation decision is made for X SCells. As a result, X + 1

SCells are activated at once resulting in the optimization of total SCell activation time. The

pre-activated SCell is deactivated if the anticipated traffic increase does not occur.

SCell activation is achieved through the transmission of an Activation-Deactivation Medium

Access Control (MAC) Control Element (CE) with the SCell index bit set to one.

Once activated, the UE is polled for SCell channel status information. Downlink data

transmissions are allowed on the SCell if the SCell channel information is received and

estimated channel quality is sufficient. Downlink data transmissions are also allowed on the Scell

before up-to-date channel status information is received, if the channel quality estimated during the

previous activation period is also sufficient, see Secondary Cell Reactivation.

### 3.6.3 Secondary Cell Reactivation

Activated SCells can only be used for downlink transmission if they have sufficient

channel quality estimated based on the CQI reported by the UE. If an SCell is being

activated, CQI is requested following a successful transmission of the MAC CE command.

Reception time of the channel quality report from the UE depends on the following

factors:

- Uplink channel conditions
- Number of configured SCells

The reception time can vary from a few milliseconds to dozens of milliseconds.

To enhance the UE experience, the SCell reactivation procedure accelerates the use of

SCells activated by a successful MAC CE command. The scheduler can start PDSCH

transmissions using the channel quality estimated during the previous activation period

while waiting for an up-to-date CQI report. Such transmissions are only possible if the

stored channel estimation is sufficient and it is not older than 2.5 seconds. The first

such transmission cannot be scheduled earlier than 16 ms after a successful transmission

of the MAC CE command. When the up-to-date CQI report is received, the channel quality

is reestimated based on it, and further transmissions are only allowed if the estimated

quality is sufficient.

When stored channel estimation is not valid:

The SCell is not reactivated if the stored channel estimation is not valid for one of the

following reasons:

- The channel estimation is not sufficient to schedule an SCell.
- The channel estimation is older than 2.5 seconds.
- The SCell is activated for the first time.

Transmissions are only allowed after the reception of the first CQI report

resulting in a sufficient channel estimation.

### 3.6.4 Secondary Cell Deactivation

The SCell is only deactivated if one of the conditions from Secondary Cell Activation or Deactivation Triggers are met, while the prohibit timer is not running.

Additional triggers are described below.

In FDD, when the Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature is enabled and the UE is

configured with a QCI 1 bearer, any configured secondary cells will become deactivated. When

the QCI 1 bearer is removed, the SCell may become activated again. However, if attribute

CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte is set to

TRUE, the following applies for the SCell:

- UEs receive PDSCH transmissions for the subframes when there is no VoLTE packet within the eNodeB.
- UEs receive no PDSCH transmission for the subframes from the time interval that a VoLTE packet arrives in the eNodeB and until it departs the eNodeB.

In TDD, Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation does not apply to UEs which are

configured with carrier aggregation.

In FDD-TDD carrier aggregation, when the Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature is enabled and the UE

is configured with a QCI 1 bearer, any configured SCells become deactivated. When the

QCI 1 bearer is removed, the SCells become activated again. The value of the

CarrierAggregationFunction.pdcchEnhancedLaForVolte attribute does

not impact this behavior.

With the Carrier Aggregation, LTE Broadcast, and Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

licenses enabled, the features can be used simultaneously. However, UEs with SCell configured

at the time of any eMBMS service change in this cell will have their SCell deactivated for the

duration of current UEs connection.

Locking the physical cell associated with the SCell also triggers

deactivation of the SCell.

SCell deactivation is achieved through the transmission of an Activation-Deactivation

MAC Control Element with the SCell index bit set to zero. As at activation,

the MAC CE is piggy-backed on PCell data and repeated

multiple times. The eNodeB considers the SCell as deactivated when

the first HARQ ACK detection parameter is received after the burst

occurred that contained the Activation-Deactivation MAC CE.

## 3.7 Downlink Data Transmission on Multiple Carriers

The PCell is always active, whereas the SCells are dynamically activated or deactivated. When

a UE has activated SCells and the DL channel quality on SCells is above a specified threshold,

DL data can be transmitted over multiple carriers. The amount of data sent on each carrier is

proportional to the bandwidth and the DL channel quality of the carrier. Data splitting onto

multiple carriers only occurs if the data to be sent exceeds a specified threshold. If the

amount of data sent does not exceed this threshold, transmission only occurs on the carrier

that could potentially send more data given the constraints of carrier bandwidth and DL

channel quality on the carrier.

## 3.8 Limiting the Number of CA Users

A UE configured with an SCell consumes twice as many resources as a UE that only has a PCell,

yet it is still counted as one connected UE from a connected UE license perspective. There are

two ways to limit the extra resources consumed by SCells:

- Limit the total number of SCells configured on the eNodeB via caUsageLimit TOOLTIPFLAG, regardless of the number of connected UEs
- Stop configuring new SCells when the total resource usage on a Basedband, the total number of connected UEs + the total number of configured SCells, exceeds Maximum RRC Connected Users * (100 - caPreemptionThreshold TOOLTIPFLAG) / 100. By stopping the configuration of new SCells and natural UE attrition, the number of SCells configured on the eNodeB is indirectly regulated

The Maximum RRC Connected Users is a Baseband hardware capacity limit which can be found in

the Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

RAN.

These two mechanisms work independently of each other. For example, the eNodeB stops

configuring SCells if the number of connected UEs is high, even though the SCells configured

are still below

caUsageLimit

. Using the correct

caPreemptionThreshold

setting, there is a high probability that the licensed connected user number can be

reached at high loading without limiting the number of CA users at low loading.

## 3.9 Size Reduction of UECapabilityInformation Message

UEs supporting 3GPP release 13 or release 14 have the possibility to enable the size

reduction of the UECapabilityInformation message.

The size of the UECapabilityInformation message is decreased in the

following cases:

- When higher CC (Component Carriers) are not required, with the requestedMaxCCsDL-r13 or the requestedMaxCCsUL-r13 IEs.
- When fallback band combinations are skipped with the use of requestSkipFallbackComb-r13 IE.
- When some intra-band non-contiguous band combinations are skipped with the use of requestReducedIntNonContComb-r13 IE.

IEs in the UECapabilityEnquiry message are used to decrease the size of

the UECapabilityInformation.

Refreshing Capabilities After Handover

Because of the size reduction of the UECapabilityInformation message,

there is a possibility that after handover, not enough information is passed to the

target eNodeB for carrier aggregation configuration.

As a solution for this, after the handover from the source eNodeB, the target eNodeB

triggers refreshing of the UE Capabilities by sending the

UECapabilityEnquiry RRC message.

### 3.9.1 Refresh Mechanism for UE Capabilities

With 3GPP Release 11, the eNodeB is able to indicate to the UE what information it needs

for band combinations by sending this information in a

UECapabilityEnquiry message.

The UE responds with a subset of UE capability information regarding band combinations

that match the network bands available. This message is a combination of UE capabilities

information and information on what the eNodeB can use from those capabilities. The

network band can tell the UE what it is relevant and then get UE capabilities tailored

for that.

When the UE moves, the information useful for the source eNodeB is no longer valid for

the target eNodeB. Therefore, the eNodeB uses the UE capability information refresh

function.

By using this mechanism the eNodeB compares the UE capability information which was

received from the source eNodeB during handover or fetched from the eNodeB and decides

if this information is sufficient, or another enquire is required. The eNodeB is able to

refresh UE capability information in two ways:

| Connected mode   |    | The UECapabilityEnquiry is sent after the handover. The eNodeB                         configures Carrier Aggregation and waits for the refreshed UE capability                         information. Once the UE capability information is received, Carrier                         Aggregation is configured.   |

| Idle mode        |    | The eNodeB sends a UECapabilityEnquiry during initial                         connection establishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The auto-refresh mechanism functionality for the UE capability information has the

following properties:

- It is only applicable for UEs supporting requestedBands-r11 IE. If the UE does not support this IE, the auto-refresh functionality is not triggered.
- Bands listed on the requestedFreqBandsFiltered list of the target eNodeB make up a different list than the one received from the source eNodeB. They are not a subset of bands received in handover message from the source eNodeB.
- The requestMaxCCsDL MO attribute is set to a higher value than indicated in requestedMaxCCsDL-r13IE.
- The requestMaxCCsDL MO attribute is set to a higher value than indicated in requestedMaxCCsDL-r13.
- The eNodeB has the requestedMaxCCsUL-r13 IE in the UECapabilityInformation message. Note: This action takes place at initial connection establishment or incoming handover.
- The target eNodeB has the requestSkipFallbackComb MO attribute set to ENABLED
- The previous eNodeB did not request skipping fallback combinations
- The target eNodeB is capable of higher than 5CC Carrier Aggregation and the UE supports 3GPP Release 13 or above.
- The eNodeB is configured to use the reduced format of UE capabilities Note: This action takes place at initial connection establishment or incoming handover.

### 3.9.2 Disabling UE Capabilities Refresh Mechanism for Voice

3GPP Release 12 introduces the mo-VoiceCall connection establishment

cause to identify mobile originated voice call.

The UE indicates mo-VoiceCall connection establishment cause to the

eNodeB in the RRCConnectionRequest message.

When the Disabling UE Capability Refresh for Voice function is enabled, the eNodeB does

not send UE CapabilityEnquiry RRC messages to the UE during a voice call

if it already received the UE Capability Information message from the

MME.

The missing information relevant for supported carrier aggregation band combinations or

other UE capability information is not fetched in the period of a voice call. Functions

requiring the latest UE capability information cannot operate properly during a voice

call if the Disabling UE Capability Refresh for Voice is enabled. Therefore, this is

only recommended to enable when the missing latest UE capability information cannot

cause service degradation.

This function is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.ueCapRefreshProhibitMoVoice or the

EUtranCellTDD.ueCapRefreshProhibitMoVoice attribute to

true.

For the operation of this function the following requirements must be fulfilled:

- ENM version 21.2 or later is required.
- UE must support capabilities defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 version 12.12.0 or later, and the mo-VoiceCall-v1280 IE introduced in 3GPP TS 36.331 version 12.8.0.

## 3.10 Intra-eNodeB Inter-Capacity Module Carrier Aggregation

The Inter-Capacity Module Support for Carrier Aggregation feature enhancement allows

for carrier aggregation between LTE capacity modules configured on the same eNodeB in mixed

mode configuration.

The capacity modules are connected through an internal E5 link to allow for carrier

aggregation. The inter-capacity module Round-Trip Time (RTT) latency must not exceed 20

µs.

The Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD feature must be activated to

allow for inter-capacity module carrier aggregation if the LTE capacity modules are

configured in different modes.

The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail

attribute must be ENABLED\_ICM for inter-capacity module carrier

aggregation.

An SCell is configured for intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module carrier aggregation if the

following conditions are met:

- Inter-capacity module carrier aggregation partners are connected through an internal E5 link.
- The value of the ENodeBFunction.interCapModLink attribute is set to the default value of true.
- The EUtranCellRelation MO exists on the eNodeB with configured intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module carrier aggregation partners.
- If the PCell is configured as TDD, the SCell must also be configured as TDD. If the PCell is configured as FDD, the SCell can be configured as FDD or TDD.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL. Note: If the Automatic SCell Management feature is activated, the value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute can be set to AUTO. In this case, the value of the EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute must be set to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for SCell configuration. For more information, see Automatic SCell Management.

The SCell is released if the SCell or the PCell is disabled, or the configured cell

relation is changed so that carrier aggregation is not supported.

| SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset | Affecting | This attribute can affect the activation and deactivation of the                                     SCell used for carrier aggregation.  When the ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package feature is active,             the operator can configure differentiated SCell activation and deactivation threshold             for the UEs in subscriber groups by using the                 SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset             attribute.  If the                 SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute is             configured, the threshold for the UEs in a subscriber group is the sum of the following                 attributes:  CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres     SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset     For the UEs that are not in the subscriber group, the                 CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres attribute             determines the SCell activation and deactivation threshold.

# 5 Network Impact of Carrier Aggregation

This section describes how the Carrier Aggregation feature impacts

the network functions and capabilities.

## 5.1 Capacity and Throughput

Each Carrier Aggregation UE with one configured SCell consumes

the memory of two connected users in the system. As a result, the

maximum total number of RRC\_CONNECTED users

decreases by the number of Carrier Aggregation UEs connected.

## 5.2 Mobility

There are no changes to mobility from the previous releases. Mobility

is based on PCell coverage. Refer to 3GPP TS 36.331:

- A1 measurement: Serving values improve to a higher level than threshold level.
- A2 measurement: Serving values degrade to a lower level than threshold level.
- A3 measurement: Neighbor offset values improve to a higher level than PCell values.
- A5 measurement: PCell values deteriorate to a lower level than threshold1 values and neighbor values improve to a higher level than threshold 2 values
- B1 measurement: Inter-RAT neighbor values improve to a higher level than threshold values.
- B2 measurement: PCell values deteriorate to a lower level than threshold1 and inter RAT neighbor values improve to a higher level than threshold 2 values.

PCell values always change at handover. In the new PCell. the old

SCell is removed and a new SCell is configured even if the SCell is

the same. All this is handled in the same RRCConnectionReconfiguration message at the handover event.

## 5.3 Performance

At additional SCell configuration during initial connection, connection reestablishment,

or incoming handover, the following impacts apply to UEs configured with carrier

aggregation:

- The number of RRC connection reconfiguration procedures increases when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.
- The size of the RrcConnectionReconfiguration and HandoverPreparationInformation messages and the time to complete the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure might increase when CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION or ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION.

# 6 Associated Features and Affected Functions

This section describes how the Carrier Aggregation feature affects

other features and functions.

## 6.1 Affected Features

Feature Carrier Aggregation is a prerequisite for the features Uplink Carrier Aggregation and

Elastic RAN.

Be

aware that in the following cases there are compatibility issues between Carrier Aggregation

and Virtual Sectors:

- When Carrier Aggregation is activated after Virtual Sectors, the SCell candidate relations must be set to the overlapping virtual sectors.
- When Carrier Aggregation is activated before Virtual Sectors, although Carrier Aggregation cannot work, the Carrier Aggregation configuration between these virtual sectors can be kept anyway. The license for Virtual Sectors can be turned off to use Carrier Aggregation again.
- Carrier Aggregation cannot work between virtual sectors, but Carrier Aggregation is still possible between a virtual sector and a normal sector. For an example see figure below.

There are three carriers per radio. One carrier (f3) covers the full physical sector and

the other two carriers (f1 and f2) cover the virtual sectors.

# 10 Engineering Guidelines for Carrier Aggregation

## 10.1 Enable Size Reduction of UECapabilityInformation Message

Activating band combination reduction enables size reduction of the

UECapabilityInformation message for UEs that support release 13 or

release 14.

Steps

1. Set the BandCombCompression.requestedBandCombCompression to 2.
2. Set the BandCombCompression.requestReducedFormat attribute to ENABLED.
3. Set the BandCombCompression.requestSkipFallbackComb attribute to ENABLED.
4. Set the BandCombCompression.requestReducedIntNonContComb to ENABLED.

## Appendix A.c: 17.Q3: Optimization of UE CA Band Combination Report by Using requestedFrequencyBands

Enabling the assignment of an optimal band combination for Carrier Aggregation, also enabling suboptimal SCell selection by the eNB that varies unpredictably from UE.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3046 R6                    |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

If a UE supports more than 128 band combinations for Carrier Aggregation, it will drop some

when reporting supported band combinations, depending on implementation. This could

result in suboptimal SCell selection by the eNB that varies unpredictably from UE to

UE.

In the UECapabilityEnquiry message, the eNB now populates the

parameter requestedFrequencyBands and takes advantage of the

Rel-11 functionality requestedFrequencyBands. This way the UE has

access to an additional 256 combinations to communicate its capabilities.

UEs supporting this functionality only report UE supported band combinations out of the bands

listed in the parameter. This will reduce the risk of dropping band combinations and

reduce the risk of a suboptimal Scell selection in the eNB.

UEs not supporting the functionality will continue to report all supported band

combinations.

Capacity and Performance

In a network with many possible band combinations, a larger portion of the UEs will

be able to do complete reporting of their supported bands. This enables the

assignment of an optimal band combination for Carrier Aggregation and it can lead to

increased UE throughput.

With the ability to exchange up to 384 band combinations, the UE Capability

Information messages can become larger. Messages exceeding the supported size are

discarded,reducing accessibility. Disabling this feature restricts the UE to 128

combinations, and provides a way to limit the message size.

| Access Type:            | LTE                   |

This enhancement provides new benefits for

BandCombCompression.requestedBandsFiltered parameter.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This enhancement allows control of the content of requestedFrequencyBands

IE in the UECapabilityEnquiry message.

The content of requestedFrequencyBands IE is taken from MOM attribute

BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered if it is not

empty. BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered can be set

manually or with the populateRequestedFreqBandsFiltered

action.

MOM attribute BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered introduces the

possibility to control the list of the bands in

UECapabilityEnquiry message manually. This allows control of

UECapabilityInformation message size, depending on the number

of CA band combinations reported by the UE. The upper limit of the number of bands

depends on radio conditions and UE capability. When requesting bands, a larger

requested number of bands can lead to problems with uploading responses from UE in

poor radio conditions.

populateRequestedFreqBandsFiltered fills

BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered parameter with

a list of the bands capable of Carrier Aggregation. Any previous content of the list

is erased.

If BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered is empty, then eNodeB

populates requestedFrequencyBands IE with bands.

If BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered is empty, then the eNodeB

populates requestedFrequencyBands IE with bands. If the MFBI

feature is enabled and

BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered is empty, then

UECapabilityEnquiry message includes

requestedFrequencyBands-r11 based on the following:

- Configured bands at the node
- additionalFreqBandList
- External frequency bands (when SCell Candidate is set to allowed)

ExcludeAdditionalFreqBandLIst is excluded from

requestedFrequencyBands-r11.

If BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered is not empty, then

requestedFrequencyBands-r11 in

UECapabilityEnquiry message is based on

BandCombCompression.requestedFreqBandsFiltered only.

## Appendix A.e: 19.Q4: Accelerated SCell Scheduling

This enhancement improves the SCell activation and scheduling procedure.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3046/1        |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405          |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type:            | LTE                   |

Benefits

Improved MAC-CE SCell activation handling. Fewer repetitions of MAC-CE commands are

sent which decreases the activation time of consecutive SCells.

Capacity and Performance

The required MAC-CE activation and deactivation signaling is reduced. The MAC-CE

SCell activation and deactivation procedure is improved for carrier aggregation

users.

Operation

No impact.

## Appendix A.f: 20.Q1: Accelerated SCell Scheduling

This feature enhancement improves SCell activation time.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3046          |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405          |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type:            | LTE                   |

Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces support for SCell preactivation. If UE buffer

increase is detected, activating additional SCells happens earlier to prepare for

the increased traffic. This preactivation reduces the total activation time of the

SCells.

Capacity and Performance

Total SCell activation time is reduced. Data scheduling on SCells might be

accelerated. This change results in better UE experience and better use of SCells

for carrier aggregation users.

Operation

Because of SCell preactivation, transmission on consecutive SCells can start earlier

and less time is needed to transmit data buffer to carrier aggregation UEs. The

following counters can be affected:

- pmCaActivatedDlSum
- pmLaaActivatedSum
- pmCaScheduledDlSum

Impact on pmCaActivatedDlSum and

pmLaaActivatedSum counters can only be observed for nodes

where CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellActDeactDataThres and

UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaSCellActDeactDataThres attributes

are not set to −1 or 0.

## Appendix A.g: 20.Q2: Accelerated SCell Scheduling

This enhancement improves the SCell activation and scheduling procedure.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type:            | LTE                   |

Benefits

This enhancement introduces optimization for the aperiodic CQI reporting routine.

Aperiodic CQI requests for SCells are prioritized under activation, so up-to-date CQI

is received earlier. This decreases the activation time of the SCell and scheduling

data on the activated SCell can start earlier.

Capacity and Performance

Up-to-date CSI response for SCells under activation can be received earlier thus data

scheduling on SCells might be accelerated. This results in better UE experience.

Operation

No impact.

## Appendix A.h: 20.Q3: Accelerated SCell Scheduling

This enhancement accelerates the SCell scheduling procedure.

| Feature Name:           | Carrier Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3046/1        |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405          |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type:            | LTE                   |

Benefits

This enhancement introduces support for SCell reactivation to accelerate the data

scheduling on SCells. Channel estimation of the activated SCell is stored after

deactivation. The estimation can be reused during the next activation to start

scheduling data on a reactivated SCell earlier.

Capacity and Performance

Data scheduling on SCells might be accelerated. This results in better UE experience

and better use of SCells for carrier aggregation users.

Operation

This enhancement is integrated into the legacy Carrier Aggregation function of SCell

activation and it is enabled by default. The improvement of SCell scheduling time is

not reflected directly in any counter. Accelerated scheduling of SCells is expected

to increase the use of secondary carriers in terms of volume and number of

assignments. The following counters can be used to observe the increase:

- pmDlAssigsTransSCell
- pmDlAssigsWithDetectedHarqAckSCell
- pmRadioThpVolDlSCell
- pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCell
- pmCaScheduledDlSum

Reusing stored channel estimation during SCell reactivation provides faster

transmission of PDSCH packets on the SCell if the UE radio conditions do not get

worse during the validation time. This solution for UEs under fast-changing radio

conditions can lead to the minor degradation of counters and KPIs related to PDSCH

HARQ and RLC success ratio.

This enhancement impacts the following KPIs and PIs:

| DL HARQ BLER         |    | NACK is increased for PDSCH, leading to an increase of downlink HARQ BLER for SCells.                                                                                                                                                                |

| DL HARQ Success Rate |    | NACK is increased for PDSCH, leading to a decrease of downlink HARQ                                 success rate for SCells.                                                                                                                         |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional              |

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, PCells and SCells can be configured for carrier

aggregation across capacity modules that belong to the same eNodeB.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Flexible carrier aggregation for eNodeBs configured with two LTE capacity modules in mixed mode configuration
- High carrier aggregation capacity for the eNodeB

Capacity and Performance

Resources for intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module carrier aggregation are shared with

resources for elastic RAN carrier aggregation on the capacity module level. This

includes but is not limited to the following resources:

- The number of carrier aggregation partners
- The number of configurable ESCells
- E5 link throughput

The inter-capacity module carrier aggregation can be observed through the following

PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActivatedDlIcmSum

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following MOM changes:

- The ENABLED\_ICM and the ICM\_SCELL\_DISABLED values are introduced for the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute to show if inter-capacity module carrier aggregation is possible on the eNodeB.
- The ENodeBFunction.interCapModLink attribute is introduced to enable the configuration of carrier aggregation partners for inter-capacity module carrier aggregation.

Intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module carrier aggregation can be set up if the following

conditions are met:

- The ENodeBFunction.interCapModLink attribute is set to true, which is the default value.
- The Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD feature is activated to allow for inter-capacity module carrier aggregation if the LTE capacity modules are configured in different modes.
- The EUtranCellRelation MO exists for the eNodeB with configured intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module carrier aggregation partners.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute is ENABLED\_ICM.
- The inter-capacity module carrier aggregation partners are connected through an internal E5 link.

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to observe

inter-capacity module carrier aggregation:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActivatedDlIcmSum
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfDlIcmSumDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaScheduledDlIcmSumDistr
