Summary

The Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes feature is designed to automate the

allocation of radio subframes used

by

the eMBMS.

The feature enables the automatic configuration of MbmsService MO instances

for

the eMBMS.

The Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes feature has the following

benefits:

- MbmsService MO instances do not need to be configured manually.
- Allows the MBMS to use only a subset of available subframes from the list of subframe allocation configurations, which is defined through the MbsfnArea.commonSFAllocList attribute. This increases the number of available subframes for other forms of traffic.
- Operators can set the maximum number of MBMS subframes. The feature automatically chooses the smallest possible subset of MBMS subframes each time the MBMS session broadcast is started or stopped.

# 3 Feature Operation of Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

The Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes feature enhances the LTE Broadcast

feature.

## 3.1 LTE Broadcast Configuration

The PmchMch.qci and MbsfnArea.serviceAreaId

parameters are used to configure a mapping of MBMS sessions to multicast channels (MCH)

based on the QCI parameters received in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST

M3AP messages. A list of up to 10 PmchMch.qci values can be

configured for a PmchMch MOI. The PmchMch.qci must

be unique within the whole MBSFN area the PmchMch MOI belongs to.

The eNodeB calculates the number of subframes needed for every service based on the GBR

parameter received in the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST M3AP  message. The

subframes that are reserved for MBMS service transmission are unavailable for other

forms of traffic. The PmchMch.sfAllocEnd and

MbmsService.logicalChannelIdentity attributes and

MbmsService.tmgiList entries are set automatically when the

Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes feature is active. Both

PmchMch.sfAllocEnd and

MbmsService.logicalChannelIdentity are updated whenever an MBMS

session is started or removed from an MBSFN area.

It is not possible to have more than 8 SubFrameConfigs of

MbsfnArea.commonSFAllocList instances in any cell, summed up from

all active MbsfnArea MOIs that are connected to this cell. If the

activation of an MbsfnArea MOI is attempted in a cell that would

break this rule, the MbsfnArea MOI is not activated in this cell and

an Inconsistent Configuration alarm for the

MbsfnArea is raised.

It is not possible to operate the LTE Broadcast feature in an

MbsfnArea containing a mix of MbmsService MOIs

that are created manually and automatically.

Figure 1   Managed Object Model Changes

## 3.2 MBMS session start

The procedure for starting an MBMS session by MME is the following:

1. The eNodeB maps an MBMS session to an MBSFN area and an MCH if the following criteria is met: At least one MBMS Service Area from the M3AP MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message matches at least one MBMS Service Area from MbsfnArea.serviceAreaId. QCI is found in PmchMch.qci in the MbsfnArea MOI. The eNodeB uses the GBR parameter in the previously mentioned message to calculate the number of subframes to allocate for the session.
2. When an M3AP MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message is received and accepted, the eNodeB creates an MbmsService MOI with the attribute createdBy set to SYSTEM. The MbmsService MOI is created under each MbsfnArea MOI that the session has been mapped to. If a suitable MbsfnArea or PmchMch MOI is created after the M3AP message is accepted, the MbmsService MOI is not recreated in it. Only one MbmsService MOI with a certain entry from MbmsService.tmgiList can be in a certain MbsfnArea MOI. Only two instances of the MbmsService MO (in different MbsfnArea MOIs) with the same entry from MbmsService.tmgiList can exist in the node.
3. The eNodeB prioritizes all sessions based on the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) Priority Level and the Service ID from TMGI from the MBMS SESSION START REQUEST M3AP message. The ARP Priority Level is the primary criterion for the sequence order. A session with a higher ARP Priority Level is put before a session with a lower ARP Priority Level. Since more than one session can have the same ARP Priority Level, the Service ID from TMGI is used as the secondary criterion for the sequence order. A session with a lower Service ID from TMGI is given resources before a session with a higher Service ID from TMGI.Note: If there is not enough available subframe resources, the sessions with the lowest priority are not broadcast. Also, the MbmsService.operationalState attribute is set to DISABLED and the MbmsService.availabilityStatus attribute is set to OFF\_DUTY in the related MO instances. The RESOURCE ALLOCATION FAILURE alarm is raised.
4. Every time a new session is started, the eNodeB performs a reallocation of all sessions on the concerned MBSFN areas. This can change every MbmsService MO instances. If a higher priority MBMS service cannot fit into the MBSFN Area (there are not enough available MBMS subframes) but a lower priority MBMS service could, neither is broadcast.Note: If there is not enough available MBMS subframes, the sessions with the lowest priority are not broadcast. Also, the MbmsService.operationalState attribute is set to DISABLED and the MbmsService.availabilityStatus attribute is set to OFF\_DUTY in the related MO instances. The RESOURCE ALLOCATION FAILURE alarm is raised.

## 3.3 MBMS session stop

If this feature is active and the corresponding MbmsService MOI has

been created by the system, the eNodeB deletes the MOI and re-allocates all of the

sessions on the concerned MBSFN areas. If there are any pending MBMS Sessions, the

eNodeB checks if there are enough resources to activate any of them. If one such session

gets resources, the MbmsService.operationalState changes to

ENABLED. If there are no pending sessions left then the

RESOURCE ALLOCATION FAILURE alarm is disabled.

# 4 Network Impact of Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

The Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes feature improves the network capacity

of the LTE Broadcast feature.

Capacity and Performance

To improve the capacity, the feature uses the smallest possible subset of subframes

needed by active eMBMS services, up to the maximum amount defined in

MbsfnArea.commonSFAllocList. The subframes that are reserved

by the active services in an MBSFN area are unavailable for other forms of traffic.

The remaining subframes can be allocated freely.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

The feature can be configured through MbmsService

parameters.

# 7 Activate Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- Configuration of the LTE RAN is prepared for an LTE Broadcast.
- MME, MBMS GW and BM-SC nodes are ready to run LTE Broadcast.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012012 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012012 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines of Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

The feature has various availability status depending on its operational

state.
