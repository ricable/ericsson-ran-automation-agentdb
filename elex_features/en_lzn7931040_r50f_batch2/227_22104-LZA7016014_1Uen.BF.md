Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

This is a licensed feature. This means that for the feature to be operational, a

valid license key must be installed and the feature must be explicitly activated by

setting a MOM attribute.

The Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package feature is license controlled. The

functionality is switched on with a license key.

The following must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- Configuration of eight RX antennas

# 3 Feature Operation of Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package

The Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package feature has eight RX antenna paths in

each cell.

The Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package feature supports the same behavior as the

licensed Quad Antenna Uplink Performance Package feature but with

better performance.

The supported number of cells for different configurations is described in DU and

Baseband Configurations and Capacity in the Hardware library.

Radio Building Block Configuration

An RBB defines a unique way of combining internal radio units or external radio units

in one sector with connections to Baseband units and the antenna system.

The following documents provide further information about RBB configurations:

- Antenna and RF Connections
- Radio Node Configurations

Support of 8TX/8RX, 4TX/4RX, and 2TX/2RX Cells in the Same eNodeB

This feature supports a mix of TDD and FDD cells with different sector antenna

branches in the same eNodeB, in configurations with a Baseband unit.

If 8TX/8RX, 4TX/4RX and 2TX/2RX cells co-exist in the same Baseband unit, the KPI of

all cells is aligned with the 8TX/8RX cells.

For 2TX/2RX cells in SectorCarrier.no0fRxAntennas attribute value

must be set to 2, for 4TX/4RX cells the value must be set to 4, and for 8TX/8RX

cells the value must be set to 8.

Receiver Antenna Configuration

The receiver antenna configuration used for the Octal Antenna Uplink Performance

Package feature is four columns of cross-polarized antenna elements spatially

separated by less than a wavelength. Physical antenna ports 0 to 3 have one

polarization and antenna ports 4 to 7 have the other polarization.

The following ports are pairs of cross polarization:

- 0 and 4
- 1 and 5
- 2 and 6
- 3 and 7

For more information about antenna configurations, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Antenna Combining Methods

The Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package feature can, together with the optional

IRC feature, use IRC as an antenna combining method. However, without the IRC

feature activated, MRC is used as antenna combining method for the eight

antennas.

Eight-way Receiver Diversity

Eight-way Receiver Diversity either MRC or IRC is used for antenna combining. If the

IRC feature is deactivated, the UL physical layer receives all eight streams using

full eight-way receiver MRC, otherwise eight-way receiver IRC is used.

Interference Rejection Combining provides more

information about the IRC feature functionality.

# 4 Network Impact of Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package

The Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package increases capacity in the

cells.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases capacity. For coverage limited UEs the throughput increases

compared to using basic two-way RX diversity.

For each Baseband unit up to three sectors (cells) with eight antennas are

supported.

The coverage improvement, in terms of link performance gain, is 6 dB depending on the

antenna configuration.

# 5 Parameters for Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package

The Octal Antenna Uplink Performance Package feature introduces the

OctAntUlPerfPkgId parameter and has two affecting

parameters.
