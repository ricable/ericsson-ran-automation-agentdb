Summary

The Multi-Operator RAN feature enables two Baseband units that belong to different

operators to share radio units and the support system. Operators have their own carriers and

individual configuration of all parameters, for example QoS and transport network

configuration.

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Multi-Operator RAN

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following network prerequisites must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- Any GNSS receiver must be of type GPS 02. For limitations when using the GNSS receiver configuration, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.
- Node Group Synchronization must be configured for Baseband units.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multi-Operator RAN

The Multi-Operator RAN feature allows two nodes that belong to different operators to

share the radio units.

The Multi-Operator RAN feature allows two nodes that belong to different operators to share

the radio units in a mixed mode configuration. Each node represents different eNodeBs in the

LTE RAN. If the nodes are installed in the same cabinet, they also share the support system.

When sharing radio units, operators need to work together to operate the nodes. Figure 1 shows an example in which two nodes which

consist of one Baseband unit, and which have different operators, are installed in the same

cabinet.

Figure 1   Two LTE Nodes That Consist of One Baseband Unit Belonging to Different

Operators

## 3.1 Network Management

Baseband units in multi-operator RAN are managed separately from the respective network

management systems.

From the OSS, the different Baseband units in the RBS appear as separate individual nodes.

For more information about Multi-Operator RAN in the OSS, see the OSS CPI.

The Baseband units are seen as separate nodes and configured separately. However, some

coordination regarding configuration and maintenance is necessary. Some configurations, for

example, the antenna configuration is controlled only by data from the OSS of one of the

nodes. Similarly, some antenna system or support system alarms are only reported from one of

the nodes. When sharing RUs, the operators need to work together at operating the nodes.

It is possible to have either separate OSS systems, or the same OSS for the two nodes in Multi-Operator RAN. When using the same OSS, extra coordination functions are available, for example to monitor all alarms for the nodes in the same cabinet.

## 3.2 Radio Configurations

In a multi-operator RAN configuration, each node has a separate radio configuration,

although the radios are shared.

Sectors in multi-operator RAN are configured with an RBB that supports a shared radio. The

sectors must also be configured for using mixed mode.

Figure 2 shows an example of a multi-operator RAN

configuration where both nodes have three sectors and where each sector has two shared

radios.

Figure 2   3×2 RU + 3×2 RU Configuration

For information on supported radio configurations and carrier allocations, see Radio Node Configurations.

Related concepts

Output Power

## 3.3 Frequency Bands

All carriers for connected nodes must be configured within the bandwidth span supported

by the radio units.

For information on supported frequency bands, see Radio Node Configurations.

## 3.4 Output Power

Maximum output power is allocated statically for each Baseband unit in the node

configuration.

When an extra carrier is configured, sometimes the radio unit needs to retune the

transmitter. In these cases, an interruption of about 1.5 s occurs on any already configured

carrier.

The maximum configurable output power level is limited for each Baseband unit by the maximum

radio output power and the power configuration set by the other Baseband unit. The unit

rejects power configuration requests if the total requested power level exceeds the internal

radio hardware limitation.

HWACs are also required to configure more than 20 W for each node. For example, if a radio

unit is shared and is configured for 30 W by the primary node and 30 W by the secondary node,

both nodes require sufficient HWAC capacity to use that radio unit.

For certain configurations, the average output power is decreased because of back-off values

applied in the radio units. For more information, see Radio Node Configurations.

Power configuration is done by each RAT using the

SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute. The power is set in mW.

## 3.5 Support System and Control

With the Multi-Operator RAN feature, one node must act as a primary node, and all

others as secondary nodes.

When two or more nodes are installed in the same cabinet, one of them acts as the primary

node in the support system and controls the climate and power functions in the cabinet. It

does not matter which node is acting primary node toward the support system in the cabinet,

however, all other nodes must be configured as secondary nodes.

For more information about primary and secondary nodes in the support system, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

## 3.6 Cabling and Connections

Information on cabling between the Baseband unit and the radio, and Non-RF connections

in RBS cabinets can be relevant to the Multi-Operator RAN feature.

For information on cabling and connections, see the following documents:

- Radio Connections
- Non-RF Connections

## 3.7 Radio Unit Fault Handling

If an error occurs in the radio, it sends fault messages to both connected Baseband

units. This can generate several alarms because of the same fault.

If a configuration fault is detected in a radio, the last setup request is rejected, and an

alarm is issued to the node that made the request. The fault can be in any of the connected

nodes, but the alarm is only sent from the affected node, which is the last one that made the

request. When handling the alarm, the operator must consider that the error can be in another

node.

Locking the radio or setting the radio in full maintenance mode, initiated from one of the

connected nodes or from the radio itself disables the radio in all connected nodes.

## 3.8 Node Group Synchronization

The NGS architecture must be used in features that share radio resources.

For information on NGS, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.

## 3.9 Antenna System Control and Supervision

The nodes sharing a common antenna system must be configured so maximum antenna control

and supervision is achieved.

The antenna system resources, such as RET and TMA, are shared by the nodes. The management

and supervision of the antenna system resources is performed by the primary node. Figure 3 shows the supported antenna configuration

types.

When using AIR products for multi-operator RAN, there are restrictions on what features one

of the operators can configure, for example:

- In an AIR 11, one of the operators cannot use MIMO and can only use one-way receiver diversity.
- In an AIR 21, one of the operators cannot use MIMO or four-way receiver diversity.

Figure 3   Antenna Configuration Types

| A   |    | No TMA supervision is configured.                                    |
|-----|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     |    |                                                                      |
| B   |    | One of the nodes can control the AISG/3GPP RET (ARET).               |
|     |    |                                                                      |
| C   |    | One of the nodes is configured to supervise AISG compatible devices. |

The nodes must be configured so the antenna system supervision works as follows:

- Antenna systems A - C: VSWR supervision on the internal radio TX feeder is possible. VSWR supervision is performed by the radio unit, and is independent of the supervision of antenna system resources, such as RETs and TMAs.
- A: The nodes do not perform feeder or TMA supervision, or control RET for co-siting configurations. The Diplexer must have a DC blocking function for the radio unit.
- B and C: One of the nodes controls and supervises the ARET in all applicable configurations.
- C: One of the nodes controls and supervises antenna equipment comprising purely of AISG-compatible devices.

In all configurations, antenna configuration data, such as attenuation and delay must be

configured in both nodes. When an ATMA is used in configuration C, the uplink

gain is read from the ATMA, and therefore does not need to be explicitly configured in the

controlling node. However, the corresponding uplink gain must also be reflected in the other

node as a negative feeder attenuation. Only one system can control the ATMA.

If none of the nodes control the ATMA in configuration C, the TMA properties

for gain and delay must be reflected in the RfBranch MO in both nodes. This

is true for configuration A as well.

One of the nodes can control and supervise ARET in configurations B, and

C. The RIU is not visible in the LTE MOM, and it is not configured.

One of the nodes can control and supervise the ATMA in configuration C.

For a general overview of the antenna system, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

# 4 Network Impact of Multi-Operator RAN

The feature can increase on the total downtime of cells and on the output power of the

Baseband radio units.

Capacity and Performance

The total downtime for cells using the Multi-Operator RAN feature can increase because

there are two nodes that can cause radio unit restarts. The restart time for a radio unit in

a multi-operator RAN configuration is also increased.

The maximum output power of each Baseband is limited since the radio unit power is shared

between the two carriers. This causes a limitation between the two carriers in the

nodes.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Multi-Operator RAN

Certain factors in the configuration can affect existing KPIs.

KPIs

Certain factors, such as inter-modulation and changes in antenna tilt can affect existing

KPIs and they can be cell-specific. Also, if one of the nodes goes down, KPIs in other nodes

can be affected.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Multi-Operator RAN

For the feature to function properly, configuration planning and node restarts must

be considered.

## 9.1 Expansion to Multi-Operator RAN

Expansion to multi-operator RAN is performed by installing and configuring the nodes in

sequential order.

To expand to Multi-Operator RAN, the same instructions apply as for expanding to mixed mode

radio or split mode radio. For more information on the process, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

## 9.2 Configuration

Configuration planning for sharing a radio unit between nodes requires detailed

knowledge of the limitations and characteristics of the units.

No check is done to find out whether the configurations in the two nodes are compatible.

Configuration planning, therefore, requires detailed knowledge of the special considerations

that must be taken when sharing a radio unit between nodes.

The following guidelines apply when configuring nodes in multi-operator RAN:

- The sum of the power allocated to the two nodes must not exceed the radio unit limitation. If the radio unit during configuration reaches the maximum power level, the radio unit rejects the configuration request. An alarm is then raised, and the cell setup fails.
- If during configuration the radio unit reaches the maximum number of carriers, it rejects the configuration request. An alarm is then raised, and the cell setup fails.
- All carrier frequencies in the same RBB must be configured so that they do not overlap in the downlink frequency or exceed the uplink or downlink IBW limitation of the radio unit. If the selected carriers are not within the radio unit IBW during configuration, the radio unit rejects the configuration request. An alarm is then raised, and the cell setup fails.
- Cells must have the same uplink and downlink configurations for shared TDD radio. This is done by setting the following attributes: EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern

## 9.3 Troubleshooting

When submitting a CSR, make sure that troubleshooting data is collected for both

nodes.

For information on what data to collect, see Data Collection Guideline. Before starting the troubleshooting

procedure, it is important to check applicable Product Life Cycle Management information to

find any relevant trouble reports.

## 9.4 Multi-Operator RAN Visibility

Information about Multi-Operator RAN visibility from the OSS can be found in the OSS

CPI.

The Element Manager shows whether a radio unit is configured to be shared with more than one

managed element by using the FieldReplaceableUnit.isSharedWithExternalMe

attribute.

## 9.5 Software Upgrade and Rollback

When software upgrade or rollback is performed, the appropriate restart rank must be

set.

Software Upgrade

RAN software upgrades are always initiated with actions on the

UpgradePackage MO, for example, to ensure that the system chooses the

appropriate restart rank.

At a software upgrade, a check is done to compare the radio software specified in the

upgrade packages for the two nodes. The latest radio software that is also compatible to the

rest of the RAN software is selected to run on the radio. If the selected software is not

the same as the currently running software, it is replaced, and the radio is restarted. This

restart causes traffic disturbances in the other node. If the software running on the radio

is not replaced during the upgrade, the traffic in the other node is unaffected.

RAN software upgrades can replace the CBF FPGA load module on the primary node. When this

load module is replaced, the system escalates a cold restart. Cold restart causes temporary

loss of GPS Out signal and a loss of timing source to the secondary node, which results in

traffic disturbances.

Software Rollback

LTE RAN automatic software rollback is initiated at upgrade and manual rollback is

initiated by selecting and restarting on a configuration version. This does not

automatically result in a rollback or downgrade of the radio software. To ensure that the

radio software rollback is successful, a manual RBS Node restart with

Rank:Cold is required.

## 9.6 Locks and Restarts

Locking and restarting a Baseband unit can affect the other Baseband unit.

Locking and restarting radio units affects the system in the following ways:

- When a radio unit is locked or set in full maintenance mode, this is propagated to all related nodes. This must be considered before planning or initiating any maintenance activity.
- Restarting radio units causes downtime in corresponding sectors in both nodes.

Locking and restarting Baseband units affects the system as follows:

- Locking or setting a Baseband unit to full maintenance mode causes all synchronization references to be dependency-locked and effectively lost. As a consequence, the Baseband unit enters holdover mode. For more information, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.
- Cold restarts repeated within a short time affect clock stability, so the Baseband unit might not be able to maintain holdover mode or its clock drifts from the other Baseband unit. This can cause traffic disturbances in the other LTE node.
- For GPS Out, locking, setting to full maintenance mode, or a warm restart of the primary node does not affect the synchronization signal to the secondary node.
- For GPS Out, a cold restart of the primary node affects the synchronization signal to the secondary node and can cause downtime. For more information, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.
- For GPS Out, locking, setting to full maintenance mode, or restarting the secondary node causes the GNSS synchronization reference to be dependency locked and effectively lost. For more information, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.
- For GPS Receiver, locking, setting to full maintenance mode, or restarting either Baseband units can also cause downtime for the other unit.

## 9.7 Alarms

If an error occurs in a shared radio, alarms are generated in all related

nodes.

Before taking action to solve an issue indicated by an alarm, the other node in the

Multi-Operator RAN configuration must be identified. Two alarms generated by the same failure

can be named differently in different nodes.

Table 3   Alarms Associated with the Multi-Operator RAN Feature

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: Mixed Mode in Multistandard (LTE + LTE) TDD Mode

| Access Type:       | LTE                                          |

| Belongs to:        | Dual-eNodeB Multioperator RAN (FAJ 801 0410) |

The main benefit of Multi-Operator RAN is that two Digital Units or Baseband units that belong

to different operators can share radio units and the support system. Operators have

their own carriers and individual configuration of all parameters. This feature

introduces the above benefits to Multistandard (LTE+LTE) TDD mode for the supported

radio types.

For supported radio types and radio configurations, and for supported digital units and

baseband units, see Radio Node Configurations.

IDU 5205 and IDU 5209 units can be used only with an IRU.

Capacity and Performance

The total downtime for cells using Multi-Operator RAN may increase since there are

two nodes that can cause radio unit restarts. The restart time for a radio unit in a

Multi-Operator RAN configuration is also increased.

Operation

The feature enables the Inconsistent Configuration to be

raised when the cells that running on the same TDD radio do not have the same

configuration of subframeAssignment,

framestartOffset and

specialSubframePattern attributes in the

EUtrancellTDD MO.
