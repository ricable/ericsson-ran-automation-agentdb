Summary

The Progressive Access Barring feature introduces three

different priority levels for the calculation of barring factors used for access

class             barring signaled in SIB2. It also introduces the possibility to map the following five

different traffic classes to any of the priority levels:

- Mobile Originating Data
- Mobile Originating Signaling
- CSFB
- MMTEL Voice
- MMTEL Video

It is possible to configure a traffic class to be barred never, so there is an

implicit fourth priority level. This means that they are given higher priority than

any traffic class that is mapped to the first three priority levels. In addition to

the five traffic classes above, the following traffic classes can be configured to

be barred never:

- SMS
- Access class 10-15, each can be individually configured to be barred always or never

| Load-Based Access Barring (FAJ 121                                     3093)                          | Prerequisite   | Load-Based Access Barring is a prerequisite to Progressive Access Barring. If                 Progressive Access Barring is activated, Load-Based Access Barring is replaced by it                 to avoid further congestion. As opposed to Load-Based Access Barring, in Progressive                 Access Barring it is possible to set different priority levels of traffic classes                 and configure different maximum barring probability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The following configurations exist for the presence attribute for each access  class                 barring parameter in the AcBarringPresence struct:  OFF     MANUAL     AUTO      If the presence of an access attempt type is set to MANUAL,                 manual access class barring is applied. If the presence is set to                     AUTO, automatic access class barring functionality is started                 automatically when the system becomes congested. The barring factor is recalculated                 periodically and sent to the UEs in the SIB2 message until the system is not                 congested. Then the automatic access class barring mechanism is stopped. |
| Inter-Frequency Load Balancing (FAJ                                     121 3009)                     | Related        | When the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is used                 together with automatic access class barring, the cell stops broadcasting its load                 status to other cells. It is removed from the list of candidates for inter-frequency                 load balancing. This is to avoid handover to an already overloaded cell. The load                 measurement is ongoing to enable the outgoing handover to other cells, and to                 decrease the load faster. If load balancing during access class barring is disabled,                 all inter-frequency load balancing processes are disabled in the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Limitations

No known limitations.

Other Network Elements

This feature requires UEs to support the following IEs introduced in Release 12 RRC

36.331:

- ac-BarringSkipForMMTelVoice-r12
- ac-BarringSkipForMMTelVideo-r12

Release 9/10/11 UEs only support SSAC but not above IEs used for skipping.

These UEs pass the barring procedure twice, the IMS/MMTel and RRC layer, before

trying the RRC connection request. This means that voice and video accessibility can

be degraded for Release 9/10/11 UEs when Progressive Access Barring is activated in

severe overload situations. Release 8 UEs ignore both SSAC and Access Class Barring

skip and use MoData barring for voice and video. For more information, see Release

9/10/11/12 3GPP TS 36.331.

## 2.1 Compatibility of Load Balancing and Automatic Access Barring

During ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, inter-frequency

load balancing for incoming handover is disabled in the cell.

When automatic access class barring is used together with Inter-Frequency Load Balancing,

the incoming handover to an overloaded cell is disabled.

Inter-frequency load balancing is enabled in the cell when the barring probability

reaches 0.

If load balancing during access class barring is enabled, that is

EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true, the

following events occur:

- The subscription ratio measurements are still ongoing in the cell when the automatic access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered.
- The function enables the cell for outgoing load balancing handover, and a faster recovery from overload.
- Triggering of the access class barring calculation mechanism does not disable subscription ratio evaluation and Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

If the Preferential Traffic Management solution is enabled, by setting

the PtmFunction.ptmEnabled attribute to

true, and the cell is configured as

priority cell, triggering of the access class barring calculation

mechanism does not disable the following events:

- Subscription ratio evaluation
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload

A cell is configured as priority cell if the following is true:

- PtmCellProfile.cellType is set to PRIORITY.
- The EUtranCellFDD.ptmCellProfileRef or the EUtranCellTDD.ptmCellProfileRef reference to a cell profile is set as priority.

Example 1   Automatic Access Class Barring Disables

Load Balancing

Figure 1   Inter-Frequency Load Management Disabled by Automatic Access Barring

The following events occur during the access class barring calculation

mechanism:

1. Before t1, inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled.
2. At t1, these load balancing functions are disabled, and automatic access class barring calculation is enabled.
3. Between t1 and t4, until the automatic access class barring calculation is enabled, the load balancing functions remain disabled.
4. At t4, the barring probability reaches its minimum value, that is 0. Inter-frequency load balancing can be enabled again.
5. Between t5 and t6, inter-frequency load balancing is disabled again.
6. Between t6 and t7, outgoing inter-frequency load balancing is enabled only if EUtranCellFDD.iflbAbEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.iflbAbEnabled is set to true.
7. At t7, the barring probability reaches its minimum value again. Inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload are enabled again.

# 3 Feature Operation of Progressive Access Barring

The feature introduces the possibility to prioritize traffic classes for access

class         barring in severe overload situations. The feature extends the operation of the Load-Based

Access Barring feature.

Automatic Access Class Barring Operation

Automatic access class barring monitors the ratio between RRC Connection

Rejects and RRC Connection Attempts and activates or

deactivates access class barring parameters in SIB2 messages. Automatic access

class                 barring uses barring information from SIB2 broadcast messages to inform UEs about

the congestion level in the system.

Access class barring starts to operate when the access class barring calculation

mechanism is triggered by the following conditions being true:

- The ratio between RRC Connection Rejects and RRC Connection Attempts is above EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh or EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshRejectRateHigh for a time interval EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh or EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh.
- The intensity of the RRC Connection Requests is higher than the minimum intensity.

During ongoing access class barring calculation mechanism, the following applies to

all access attempt types the presence of which is set to AUTO:

- The barring factor (1 - barring probability) for the common or the PLMN-specific access class barring parameter for the access attempt type is included in the next SIB2 broadcast message.
- Barring probability for the access attempt type is changed periodically, based on the measured load in the cell and the MOM configuration.
- If a UE attempts to connect to the cell and it can be barred based on its access class and access attempt type, access class barring is applied to the UE. UEs are informed about access class barring parameters in SIB2 broadcast messages.
- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing and subscription ratio measurements are disabled for the cell if the following criteria is fulfilled: Preferential Traffic Management is disabled, or the cell is not configured as a priority cell. Load balancing during access class barring is disabled.

Automatic access class barring calculation is continued

until no congestion is detected.

Figure 2   Feature Interaction Overview of Automatic Access Class Barring

Progressive Access Barring Operation

The functionality can be applied for the following traffic classes:

- CSFB
- Mobile originating data
- Mobile originating signaling
- MMTel Video
- MMTel Voice

The functionality is enabled when the access barring configuration is configured for

at least one of the traffic classes.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to AUTO, barring factors

are updated for the traffic class in the common access class barring parameters.

In Progressive Access Barring, five traffic priority levels can be used. The operator

can assign each traffic class to any priority level.

Figure 3   Barring Factor Change by Progressive Access Barring

Access class barring starts at the lowest priority level, traffic priority level

0.

When the barring probability reaches its maximum in a priority level, barring

probability starts to be changed in the next higher priority level.

While the barring probability is changed in a priority level, the barring probability

stays at its maximum value in each lower priority level.

When the barring probability reaches 0 in a priority level, barring probability

starts to be changed in the next lower priority level.

When the barring probability reaches 0 in priority level 0, access class barring

stops.

When the access class barring calculation mechanism is triggered, barring probability

is increased by EUtranCellFDD.lbabIncr or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabIncr at traffic priority level 0.

During the ongoing access class barring calculation mechanism, barring

probability is changed every EUtranCellFDD.lbabPeriod or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabPeriod depending on the relation

between the traffic load and LBAB thresholds, and the barring trend.

Timers

EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh

or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeHigh

and

EUtranCellFDD.lbabThreshTimeLow

or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabThreshTimeLow

are used to check the RRC Connection Reject ratio

whenever an automatic access class barring

functionality runs.

When the barring probability reached its maximum-the configured minimum

barring factor-the barring factor is not changed until the conditions for

decreasing it are fulfilled.

The barring factor (1 - barring probability) is updated in SIB2, and the updated

barring factor is included in the next SIB2 broadcast message.

Example 2   Traffic Class Priorities in Progressive

Access Barring

Figure 4   Traffic Class Priorities for Access Class Barring

In the example, three priority levels are configured.

Each traffic class

can be assigned to one priority level. One priority level can contain any number of

traffic classes.

Access class barring starts at traffic priority level 0, with

UEs that have the traffic types configured for priority level 0: mobile originating

data and mobile originating signaling.

When the barring probability reaches

its maximum on priority level 0, access class barring starts at traffic priority

level 1, for ViLTE.

Information Elements for Access Class Barring

Each traffic class has its own IEs for access class barring in SIB2 and RRC

messages.

Table 3   Information Elements in SIB2 and RRC Messages for Access Class

Barring

| Traffic Class                | IEs in SIB2                 |

| MMTel Video                  | ssacBarringForMMTelVideo-r9 |

SSAC was introduced in 3GPP Release 9 to provide the IMS/MMTel access

class                 barring for voice and video. If SIB2 includes

ssacBarringForMMTelVoice-r9 or

ssacBarringForMMTelVideo-r9, the RRC layer delivers this access

class barring information to the higher layer and SSAC for voice and video works at

IMS/MMTel layer on the UE side. For more information, see 3GPP TS

24.173.

### 3.1.1 Manual Access Class Barring

Manual Access Class Barring is the basic access class barring functionality. The

operation of this functionality depends only on MOM configuration, and it is independent of

the traffic load situation.

The Manual Access Class Barring functionality does not require any licensed feature.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are determined

for each traffic class based on the values of the corresponding MOM attributes.

Barring factors specified in MOM are broadcast in SIB2 messages only if the presence of

each traffic class in SIB2 is set to MANUAL. If the presence of a

traffic class in SIB2 is set to any other value-OFF or

AUTO-the AC-BarringConfig element for that traffic class is not

present in SIB2.

### 3.1.2 Load-Based Access Barring

Load-Based Access Barring is the basic automatic access class barring functionality.

The operation of this functionality depends on the traffic load situation.

The Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the Load-Based Access Barring

licensed feature is activated.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.1.3 PLMN Load-Based Access Barring

PLMN Load-Based Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. The operation of this functionality

depends on both the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access barring

configuration.

The PLMN Load-Based Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the barring factors are updated for

all traffic classes based on the traffic load situation and the PLMN-specific access

barring configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.1.4 Progressive Access Barring

Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality that

extends the Load-Based Access Barring feature. This functionality prioritizes the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

Access class barring in the common access class barring parameters starts for the traffic

classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. When the barring factor reaches

the minimum barring factor for a traffic priority level access class barring is

continued on the next higher priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.1.5 PLMN Progressive Access Barring

PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring functionality

that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality takes the

PLMN-specific access barring configuration into account when prioritizing the traffic

classes for access class barring.

The PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following licensed

features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms so that the traffic classes in the PLMN-specific access barring parameters are also taken into account.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 message is set to

AUTO, barring factors are updated for the traffic class both in

the common access barring parameters and in the PLMN-specific access barring

parameters.

### 3.1.6 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in addition to prioritizing the traffic

classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to

true.

When this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:

- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.
- Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN priority level, the level is skipped.
- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority level.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following

applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are set the same value for the traffic class as the barring factors for the traffic class on the lowest PLMN priority level.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.

### 3.1.7 Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access class barring

functionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality

prioritizes the special access class in traffic classes in addition to prioritizing the

standard access classes.

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

If the presence of a traffic class of a special access class in SIB2 is set to

AUTO, the following applies:

- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.
- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.

Barring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in

SIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to

MANUAL.

### 3.1.8 PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access

class         barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

feature. This functionality takes the PLMN-specific access barring configuration into

account when prioritizing the special access classes for access class barring.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

With this functionality, the barring factors and the priority

level are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes

algorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current

priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the

priority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to

true.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

There is no priority relation between PLMNs.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

### 3.1.9 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic

access class barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access

Classes feature. This functionality prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in

addition to prioritizing the special access classes.

The Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following

licensed features are activated:

- Load-Based Access Barring
- PLMN-Specific Access Barring
- Progressive Access Barring
- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes

The functionality is enabled if attribute

EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to true.

If the PLMN priority is lower than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to barred.

If the PLMN priority is higher than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set to not barred.

If the PLMN priority is equal to the current PLMN priority, the barring information of

the special access class is set as follows:

- If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred.
- Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.

The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority

relations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.

Hence, the priority relations among standard and special access classes of traffic

classes are the same within each PLMN priority level. The priority relations among

standard and special access classes of traffic classes are defined by the Progressive

Barring for Special Access Classes configuration.

If the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring

factors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring

parameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Progressive Access Barring

The feature has configurations related to traffic and user equipment.

BarringFactor at IEs of SIB2

If the UE has access classes corresponding to Access Class Barring parameters in

SIB2, the UE draws a random number uniformly distributed in the range: 0 ≤ rand &lt;

1. If 'rand' is lower than the value indicated by ac-BarringFactor,

it considers access to the cell as not barred. Access Class Barring is introduced in

SIB2. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331.

There

are five

traffic

class                 types:

- MO Data
- MO Signaling
- CSFB
- MMTel voice
- MMTel video

Each traffic class has its own IEs for access class barring in SIB2. Legacy LBAB

feature supports three traffic classes: MO Data, MO signaling, and CSFB. Progressive

Access Barring also supports two additional traffic classes: MMTel voice and MMTel

video. MMTel voice and MMTel video use two IEs unlike the other three traffic types.

SSAC was introduced in 3GPP Release 9 to provide the IMS/MMTel access class barring

for voice and video. If SIB2 includes ssacBarringForMMTel-Voice-r9 or

ssacBarringForMMTel-Video-r9, the RRC layer delivers this Access

Class Barring information to the higher layer and SSAC for voice and video works at

IMS/MMTel layer on the UE side. Access Class Barring skip was introduced in 3GPP

Release 12. If SIB2 includes acBarringSkipForMMTelVoice or

acBarringSkipForMMTelVideo, mobile originating MMTel voice or

video bypasses the RRC level Access Class Barring. This means that if the UE

establishes the RRC connection for mobile originating MMTel service, the UE

considers access to the cell as not barred.

MOM Attributes

After feature activation, loadBasedBarringFactor

(EUtranCellFDD.loadBasedBarringFactor or

EUtranCellTDD.loadBasedBarringFactor) and

lbabBarringPriorityLevel

(EUtranCellFDD.lbabBarringPriorityLevel or

EUtranCellTDD.lbabBarringPriorityLevel) can help monitor any

Access Barring functionality.

The following attributes can be configured for each priority level:

- EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactor
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactor
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio1
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio1
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio2
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio2
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio3
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio3
- EUtranCellFDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio4
- EUtranCellTDD.lbabMinBarringFactorPrio4

The following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and

EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence struct are used to configure

priority level for each traffic class:

- acBarringPriorityCsfb
- acBarringPriorityMoData
- acBarringPriorityMoSignaling
- acBarringPriorityMmtelVoice
- acBarringPriorityMmtelVideo

Configuration of

Progressive

Access Barring

This feature is activated when specific configurations are satisfied as shown in

Figure 6. The

configuration is similar to the configuration of Load-Based Access Barring. It is

necessary to set at least one of the following attributes to

AUTO:

- acBarringForCsfbPresence
- acBarringForMoDataPresence
- acBarringForMoSignPresence
- acBarringForMMTELVideoPresence
- acBarringForMMTELVoicePresence

Observability

The following counters can be used to check if Progressive Access Barring works

correctly and which traffic types are barred by the feature:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmAccessClassBarringMosDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAccessClassBarringMosDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmAccessClassBarringModDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAccessClassBarringModDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmAccessClassBarringCsfbDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAccessClassBarringCsfbDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmAccessClassBarringVoiceDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAccessClassBarringVoiceDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmAccessClassBarringVideoDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmAccessClassBarringVideoDistr

In addition to the above counters for Access Class Barring, the total number of RRC

connection request attempts, EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAtt or

EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAtt, and the total number of

successful RRC connection establishments,

EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSucc or

EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSucc, can also be used to monitor

the impact of Progressive Access Barring on the eNodeB.

Enabling Minimum Intensity Limit

The feature uses the

EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab and

EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab attributes to enable

adjustments to the minimum intensity limit of RRC

connection

requests in the cell. The intensity of RRC

connection

requests in the cell must be higher than the minimum intensity limit

for the feature to be operational.

The default value of the

EUtranCellFDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab and

EUtranCellTDD.minIntensityLimitForLbab attributes is

50,

which amounts to five RRC

connection

request messages every second.

Setting the value of the attributes lower than the default

value increases the probability of the Load-Based Access Barring feature being

operational in the cell. Similarly, setting the value higher than the default value

decreases the probability of the feature being operational in the cell. If the value of

the attributes is set too high, the access barring cannot be triggered, and the

Load-Based Access Barring feature can become disabled in the cell.
