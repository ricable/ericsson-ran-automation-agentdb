Summary

Figure 1   LPPa-based OTDOA Support Architecture

LPP provides a signaling interface between a UE and a positioning server. It can use either

the control protocol or the user-plane protocol as underlying transport.

LPPa is introduced in 3GPP Release 9 as a supplement to the main LPP.

The feature enables direct data collection from eNodeBs for support of downlink OTDOA

positioning.

# 2 Dependencies of LPPa-based OTDOA Support

The feature is affected by other features related to location support and

synchronization, and has additional network requirements.

| Clock Source over GPS (Part of LTE                                 Basic)           | Related        | The Clock Source over GPS feature enables radio frame time and phase                                 synchronization between RBSs with sufficient accuracy. OTDOA                                 requires time and phase synchronization accuracy to operate                                 effectively. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The eNodeB must be connected to an E-SMLC node through an MME.

# 3 Feature Operation of LPPa-based OTDOA Support

The E-SMLC requests OTDOA information from the eNodeB through the MME. This information

is used to estimate the UE position.

The LPPa procedure is initiated by the E-SMLC node. The MME receives and forwards LPPa

messages to and from the eNodeB. Between the MME and the eNodeB, the LPPa messages are carried

in dedicated S1AP Transport messages.

Figure 2   LPPa Transport over S1AP

The following S1AP messages are used to transport OTDOA LPPa messages:

- DOWNLINK NON UE ASSOCIATED LPPA TRANSPORT
- UPLINK NON UE ASSOCIATED LPPA TRANSPORT

The LPPa messages are the following:

- OTDOA INFORMATION REQUEST
- OTDOA INFORMATION RESPONSE
- OTDOA INFORMATION FAILURE
- ERROR INDICATION

The E-SMLC server can request the following OTDOA cell information from the eNodeB:

- PCI
- Cell Id
- TAC
- EARFCN
- PRS bandwidth
- PRS configuration index
- CP length
- Number of DL frames
- Number of antenna ports
- SFN initialization time
- E-UTRAN access point position

# 4 Network Impact of LPPa-based OTDOA Support

The feature has no impact on the network.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of LPPa-based OTDOA Support

This feature allows the eNodeB to provide measurement data that can be used to estimate

the location of a UE.

For more information, see LPPa-based OTDOA Support.

# 5 Parameters for LPPa-based OTDOA Support

This feature is affected by attributes related to time and phase

synchronization.
