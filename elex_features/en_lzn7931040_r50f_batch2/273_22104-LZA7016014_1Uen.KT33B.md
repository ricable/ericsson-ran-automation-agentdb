# 1 Elastic RAN Overview

Elastic RAN enables Ethernet connectivity between Baseband units located in different

racks or different locations, or both. Any Baseband unit can be coordinated with any other

Baseband unit regardless of site grid, spectrum, and deployment architecture.

Summary

The sets of cells considered for use as secondary cells are expanded across multiple

eNodeBs.

The UE has a larger set of SCells available to choose from when it performs carrier

aggregation. Because of this, the UE can find a better suited set of cells within

each frequency selected by the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation

algorithm. With the feature enabled, improved UE throughput and aggregated

throughput are expected.

Apart from the inter-baseband unit or baseband bandwidth, the carrier aggregation

performance between PCells and external SCells located on different eNodeBs is

equivalent to the carrier aggregation performance between PCells and SCells located

on the same eNodeB.

UEs can obtain the benefit of simultaneous traffic from more than one eNodeB without

depending on dual connectivity.

Shared capacity can be added by adding nodes to the Elastic RAN cluster.

Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration can be supported in specific configurations

which include LTE FDD/TDD FR1 CPRI for Radio configuration, LTE FDD FR1 CPRI for AAS

configuration.

This enables carrier aggregation features to use                         external SCell candidates.

Hardware

For the RAN Compute units that support the Elastic RAN feature, see Features for Radio Configurations.

Limitations

- Carrier aggregation across multiple PLMNs is not supported. The same PLMN must be used for all eNodeBs that are participating in Elastic RAN.
- The feature interacts with Ericsson eNodeBs only. Interacting with the eNodeBs of other vendors has no impact. The UE connects to the PCell. The ESCell is configured and activated according to the same criteria as a local cell.
- It is recommended to activate the same set of features on all eNodeBs using the Elastic RAN feature. For example, corresponding features related to the number of antennas must be activated on all eNodeBs that are using the Elastic RAN feature. If a configuration of mixed number of antennas (two, four, or eight) or the AAS configuration is used on an eNodeB, the same set of features must be activated on all eNodeBs.
- The feature supports different SpecialSubframePattern attributes between PCell and ESCell, if both PCell and ESCell are TDD.
- TDD cells of all Baseband Radio Nodes in Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation must have the same value for the FrameStartOffset attribute.
- The UE connects to the PCell. The ESCell is configured, then activated according to the FDD cells. The Carrier Aggregation feature must be activated for the Elastic RAN feature to be operational.
- If only the TDD cells are enabled on the Baseband unit, the EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute can either be set to a zero or a non-zero value for each instance. If both FDD and TDD cells are enabled on the Baseband unit, the EUtranCellTDD.frameStartOffset attribute must be set to zero for each instance.
- The FDD and TDD on the same eNodeB feature must be activated in the PCell eNodeB, even if FDD and TDD are in different Baseband Radio Nodes.
- If the PCell is TDD, then the ESCell can only be TDD.
- The feature supports only the same SubframeAssignment on Carrier Aggregation FDD-TDD.
- For the maximum number of partner nodes and ESCells for each Baseband unit, see Features for Radio Configurations.
- One or two IDLe links are used for each eNodeB.
- IDLe on IDL or TN/IDL ports, or TN port connectivity can be established between partner eNodeBs. Its port-to-port RTT latency cannot exceed 160 μs when the IDLe or TN network traffic load is high. The CPRI RTT must not exceed 150 μs. Note: When Elastic RAN traffic is using TN port (10G), it adds about 3.7-µs delay in each direction on a Baseband. TN traffic using jumbo frames can cause additional delay on the Elastic RAN traffic.
- Mixed mode deployments of the following hardware units can only be deployed with IDLe or TN port-to-port latency &lt; 60 µs RTT: RAN Compute group 4 RAN Compute group 5
- The maximum throughput between two Elastic RAN nodes is defined by the Baseband unit with the less capacity. For the maximum Elastic RAN throughput of each RAN Compute unit, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN.
- eNodeBs configured for Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation must be time- and phase-synchronized using the GNSS or GPS as a source. Configure the clock source as described in Synchronization and Fallback from Time and Phase Synchronization. One of the following attributes must be set to true for Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation to work: ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchAlignment ENodeBFunction.timeAndPhaseSynchCritical For information on setting the attributes, see Fallback from Time and Phase Synchronization. Note: A short interruption in service occurs after setting any of these attributes to true. When the eNodeBs are time- and phase-synchronized, the clock master state on both eNodeBs in a relation are RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED.
- For more information on supported hardware configurations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.
- Automatic switching between TM3 and TM9 is not supported in Elastic RAN FDD-TDD carrier aggregation. However, switching between TM3 and TM9 is supported in the Elastic RAN TDD AAS ESCell.
- TM9 is not supported in Elastic RAN TDD-TDD carrier aggregation. However, TM9 is supported in the Elastic RAN TDD AAS ESCell.
- Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration is not supported between eNodeBs in elastic RAN carrier aggregation if either of the eNodeBs is configured with two LTE capacity modules in mixed-mode and one of the capacity modules is LTE FDD/TDD FR1 eCPRI for AAS.

Network Requirements

To receive downlink data from the cells of other eNodeBs, this feature requires the

UE to support Release 10 or later.

# 3 Feature Operation of Elastic RAN

Figure 1   Elastic RAN Feature Operation for Carrier Aggregation

1. Elastic RAN specific communication is set up between eNodeBs hosting PCell-ESCell relations using the X2 network. For example, it can be used for exchanging baseband MAC addresses or cell states.
2. eNodeBs are also interconnected using Inter Digital Link ethernet (IDLe) or TN ports. Fast baseband links are set up on IDL, TN/IDL, or TN port between eNodeBs. High bandwidth information flows between eNodeBs as required. Note: TN port sharing on eNodeBs used for backhaul (S1 and X2) with Elastic RAN connectivity is possible for CA traffic only, as long as the characteristics requirements are fulfilled.
3. UE connection to PCell.

Elastic RAN Traffic Ports

For Elastic RAN traffic the following ports are supported:

- IDLe ports
- TN/IDL ports
- TN ports All available TN ports can be used. To assure required Elastic RAN traffic latency, at least 10G port is needed for Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation.

## 3.1 Carrier Deployment on Different Sites

Figure 2 shows an example where Carrier 1 and Carrier

2 are deployed on different sites.

Figure 2   Carrier Aggregation Between Different Sites

With the Elastic RAN feature, it is possible for a Release 10 or later version carrier

aggregation device to receive downlink data from cells that belong to different eNodeBs. The

eNodeB that has the serving cell (primary eNodeB) forwards user data over the IDL, TN/IDL, or

TN port to the external eNodeB that uses the SCell (ESCell). This enables the use of carrier

aggregation in cases where the carriers are not deployed on the same eNodeB. If the PCell is

TDD, then the ESCell can only be TDD.

## 3.2 Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation on the Same eNodeB

It is supported to use both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation on the

same eNodeB.

The benefits of using both features are the following:

- More carrier aggregation partners are enabled.
- Carrier aggregation on border areas between two networks is improved, as more ESCell candidates are allowed in the border area between Elastic RAN and X2 connected eNodeBs. This leads to better utilization of multiple eNodeBs in this area.
- It is supported to use the same cell as both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation partner.

When both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are activated on the

eNodeB, the value of the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPrioritizationDisabled parameter

determines which is established first. The parameter has the following values:

In case the type of link intended to be established is Elastic RAN and instead

Inter-eNodeB is established, it is advised to check with

EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail what licenses are

active on both eNodeBs.

The Inter Node Feature

Incompatibility alarm is raised when the Elastic RAN or Inter-eNodeB

Carrier Aggregation connection tunnel triggered by the Automatic SCell Management

feature cannot be set up. The alarm can be suppressed when the following conditions are

all met:

- The tunnel setup is automatically triggered by the Automatic SCell Management feature.
- The tunnel setup fails because one of the following conditions is true: The Elastic RAN feature is not activated in the remote node. The Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation feature is not activated in the remote node. The Elastic RAN and the Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features are not activated in the remote node.
- The AutoSCellMgmFunction.asmAlarmSuppression attribute is set to true.

If the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is

suppressed, the INTERNAL\_EVENT\_ASM\_TRIGGERED\_ALARM\_SUPPRESSED event is

reported.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the benefits of the enhancement:

- Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation counters EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActDlIeNbSum EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfiguredDlIeNbSum EUtranCellFDD.pmCaScheduledDlIeNbSum EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt

## 3.3 Calculating Transmission Mode and MIMO Layers in Elastic RAN SCells

Elastic RAN TDD SCells can be configured with TM9. The maximum number of downlink

MIMO layers is calculated based on the licenses activated both on the PCell and the elastic

RAN SCell.

Calculating Transmission Mode in Elastic RAN TDD SCells Used with FDD

PCell

The UE in the elastic RAN TDD SCell is configured with TM9 if all the following

conditions are met:

- The PCell is FDD.
- The SCell is an elastic RAN SCell.
- The SCell uses eight TX antennas.
- The EUtranCellTDD.transmissionMode attribute in the SCell is set to TRANSMISSION\_MODE\_9.
- The TM9 8x2 Octal Antenna Downlink Performance Package feature is activated both on the PCell and the elastic RAN SCell.
- The UE supports TM9.

The transmission mode is overridden to TM3 in any of the following conditions:

- The PCell is TDD and the SCell is an elastic RAN SCell.
- The ESCell is not an elastic RAN SCell.

Calculating MIMO Layers

SCells

The UE in the elastic RAN TDD AAS SCell is configured with TM9 if all the following

conditions are met:

- The EUtranCellTDD.tm9Allowed attribute in the SCell is set to true.
- The TM9 with AAS TDD feature is activated both on the PCell and the elastic RAN TDD AAS ESCell.
- The UE supports TM9.

For elastic RAN TDD AAS ESCells, the maximum number of MIMO layers is four.

## 3.4 Process Steps

### 3.4.1 BbLink Setup

Without Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration, the delay on the IDLe or TN connection between

the PCell eNodeB and SCell eNodeB does not exceed the value configured in the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute. Proprietary

BbLink MOs are automatically set up between Baseband units (lbm) or

capacity modules, hosting the PCell and ESCells over the IDLe or TN interface. The links are

used to coordinate scheduling between cells and to relay transport blocks between the PCells

and ESCells. Two BbLink MOs are needed to accommodate user and control data

separately between Baseband units or for each pair of capacity modules.

The links are set up under the following conditions:

- All cells included in the same Elastic RAN cluster must belong to eNodeBs that run on the same or associated software levels.
- A TnPort MO is created on the corresponding IDLe on IDL or TN/IDL ports, or TN interface that is used to connect the clustered eNodeBs. An EthernetPort MO exists hosted on this TnPort MO. If two IDLe interfaces are used, an additional TnPort MO is created on the second IDLe interface. On the additional TnPort MO, an additional EthernetPort MO is hosted.
- A VlanPort MO exists on the EthernetPort MO, set to the correct VLAN ID used in this cluster. The only other service which can refer or share VlanPort MO used for the eranVlanPortRef attribute is synchronization. An Elastic RAN VLAN PortRef attribute exists under the ENodeBFunction MO based on this VLAN port. If more than one VLAN IDs are used in this cluster, further VlanPort MOs can be created on the EthernetPort MO with different VLAN IDs. The associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef attribute refers to the VlanPort MO supporting that VLAN ID for connectivity. If two IDLe interfaces are used in this cluster, an additional VlanPort MO can be created on the EthernetPort MO that is hosted on the second IDLe interface. The associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef attribute refers to the additional VlanPort MO. If the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links are torn down. The only exception is when the value of the attribute is not set and then changed to a valid VLAN port. If the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction MO for which the change is performed are torn down. The only exception is when the value of the attribute is not set and then changed to a valid VLAN port. If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attributes of the VlanPort MO under the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links are torn down. If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attributes of the VlanPort MO under the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction MO for which change was performed are torn down.
- Both the PCell and the SCell must be in ENABLED operational state.
- An X2 connection is needed between the source eNodeB and the target eNodeB. To establish an X2 connection, an ExternalENodeBFunction MO and a TermPointToENB MO must be created on both eNodeBs.
- An EUtranCellRelation MO must exist on the source eNodeB. This MO must be set up under the following conditions: The EUtranCellRelation MO must reference an ExternalEUtranCellFDD MO or an ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO instance that represents the cell on the external eNodeB. If the cell on the external eNodeB is an LAA cell, use the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed MO instead of the EUtranCellRelation MO. In this case, the cell on the external eNodeB is represented by the ExternalEUtranCellUnlicensed MO or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO. The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute must be set to ALLOWED.Note: The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute can be set to AUTO if the following conditions are fulfilled: The Automatic SCell Management feature is operable. The EUtranCellRelation.asmStatus attribute is set to ALLOWED. The EUtranCellRelation.isRemoveAllowed attribute must be set to false.
- As a result of a successful Elastic RAN inter-ME link creation, an Elastic RAN inter-ME link MO is displayed under the ExternalENodeBFunction MO class on both the source eNodeB and the target eNodeB. Under these Elastic RAN inter-ME link MOs, two BbLink MO classes are displayed. If two capacity modules are configured in the primary eNodeB and two in the external eNodeB, up to eight BbLink MOs are displayed. If the Elastic RAN inter-ME link creation fails as a result of VLAN mismatch, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised with the following additional text: Elastic RAN cannot be activated towards remote eNodeB. VLAN IDs do not match. Expected Vlan Id: &lt;vlanId&gt;, Please check the eRAN Vlan Id at the remote eNodeB. If the value of the TermPointToENB.eranCaSwCompatibility attribute is INCOMPATIBLE or UNKNOWN, no inter-ME link can be set up for Elastic RAN carrier aggregation between the eNodeBs. If the value of the attribute is UNKNOWN, the Elastic RAN feature in not activated on the local or remote eNodeB, or the remote eNodeB software version is prior to 24.Q2. If the remote eNodeB has a software version lower than 24.Q2, the ESCell is considered deactivated, even if the Elastic RAN feature is activated on the node. If the Elastic RAN inter-ME link creation fails as a result of inter-eNodeB feature incompatibility, the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is raised with the following additional text: Elastic RAN feature is not activated in remote eNodeB. If the Elastic RAN feature is not activated on the remote eNodeB that is not an LAA cell and the operationalState attribute of the PCell is ENABLED, the Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is not raised.
- If different values are set for the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute for nodes on the same link, latency configuration is mismatched. In this case, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised with the following additional text: Elastic RAN cannot be activated towards remote eNodeB. Values of eranLinkMaxRttDelay do not match. This additional text only appears if Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration is not used on at least one eNodeB pair.

Elastic RAN Latency Autoconfiguration

For non-TDD AAS and non-RGW configurations, the feature supports automatic latency

measurements and configuration.

With Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration, the operator does not need to set the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRTTDelay attribute, as the value of

this attribute is not used by the eNodeB. Instead, the amount of E-RAN RTT link delay is

measured and set automatically, depending on the maximum RTT depedency of the given RAN

compute unit. For more information on the maximum RTT on different RAN compute units, see

Monitoring of IDLe or TN Links.

E-RAN tunnel link latency can be observed with the following read-only attributes:

- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency1minAvg
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency15minHWM
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency24hrsHWM

If the measured E-RAN tunnel link latency exceeds the maximum allowed value, the

Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable alarm is

raised with the Elastic RAN tunnel link latency exceeds maximum allowed

value. alarm text.

### 3.4.2 Dynamic External Secondary Cell Selection

To select an external cell for carrier aggregation, the

EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute must be set to

ENABLED\_ERAN. This attribute can only be set to

ENABLED\_ERAN if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The featureState attribute for the Elastic RAN license is ACTIVATED.
- A BbLink.operationalState attribute is set to ENABLED between any of the 12 neighboring eNodeBs.
- The following attributes are set to ENABLED: ExternalEUtranCellFDD.remoteCellState ExternalEUtranCellTDD.remoteCellState ExternalEUtranCellUnlicensed.remoteCellState

The EUtranCellRelation.sCellCaConfigurationAvail attribute is used to

identify if the configured ESCell is available for the Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB feature.

For more information, see Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB.

### 3.4.3 Secondary Cell Configuration and Deconfiguration

The Secondary Cell Configuration and Deconfiguration algorithm does not distinguish between

local

or

external

SCells.

### 3.4.4 Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation

The Secondary Cell Activation and Deactivation algorithm is the same as for the remote cells

in the Cross-DU Carrier Aggregation Support feature. All remote or external cells are

deactivated before local cells.

The features can be used simultaneously if the following licenses are enabled:

- Elastic RAN
- LTE Broadcast
- Autoconfiguration of LTE Broadcast Subframes

However, UEs with ESCell configured at the time of any eMBMS service change, have their

ESCell deactivated in this cell for the duration of the current UE connection.

# 4 Network Impact of Elastic RAN

The feature affects delay time and can increase inter-eNodeB throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The UEs using external secondary cells consume similar resources as the UEs using

local cells on the local eNodeB.

When Elastic RAN traffic is using TN port (10G), it adds about 3.7-µs delay in each

direction on a Baseband unit. TN traffic using jumbo frames can cause additional

delay on the Elastic RAN traffic.

If Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration is not used, that is, if the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute is

configured manually, the following is true:

- The maximum of Elastic RAN inter-node throughput can be achieved for Baseband units with maximum 20 µs RTT. To enable high throughput on the Baseband unit, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute must be set to 20.Note: The real delay between the eNodeBs must not exceed 20 µs, otherwise Elastic RAN carrier aggregation traffic can be lost.
- The RTT threshold can be set to the 20 μs, 60 μs, or 160 μs with the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute.
- The Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised when there is latency configuration mismatch between nodes on the same link.

If Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration is used and E-RAN tunnel link latency is

20-160 µs, the maximum throughput between two Elastic RAN nodes can increase in the

downlink.

If the Elastic RAN feature is enabled with different types of Baseband units, the

maximum capacity of Elastic RAN inter-node throughput between them does not reach

the value provided by a homogeneous architecture

. If different types of Baseband units

are used, the maximum throughput between two Elastic RAN nodes is defined by the

Baseband unit with less capacity.

The actual Elastic RAN inter-eNodeB throughput values are provided in the Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN

and Massive IoT RAN document.

Enabling TM9 in the TDD ESCell or in the TDD AAS ESCell provides higher beamforming

gain, which leads to the following improvements:

- Higher cell edge data rates
- Better interference handling
- Improved application coverage
- Higher downlink throughput for UEs located at the cell edge

Interfaces

The EAB eNB Feature List IE is updated to be able to calculate the

transmission mode and the maximum number of downlink MIMO layers for the TDD ESCell

in the following messages:

- X2 SETUP REQUEST
- X2 SETUP RESPONSE
- ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE

Coverage

The feature does not affect coverage, as coverage is based on PCell geography.

Mobility

The feature does not affect mobility, as mobility is based on PCell coverage.

# 5 Parameters for Elastic RAN

KPIs

The feature can be observed with the same KPIs as the Carrier Aggregation

feature.

Counters

The following PM counters can be used to observe this feature:

- ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlRecDistr
- ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlTransDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActivatedDlEranSumDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmCaActivatedDlEranSumDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaConfDlEranSumDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmCaConfDlEranSumDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaScheduledDlEranSumDistr EUtranCellTDD.pmCaScheduledDlEranSumDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran
- RiLink.pmLinkDelayHigh
- RiLink.pmLinkDelayLow

For enhanced observability of the Elastic RAN feature benefits, the following PM

counters can be considered:

- ExternalENodeBFunction.pmCaCrntiUnavail
- ExternalENodeBFunction.pmEranCaPartnerBlock
- ExternalENodeBFunction.pmEenbPktTransDlCa
- ExternalENodeBFunction.pmEenbPktRecDlCa
- ExternalENodeBFunction.pmEenbPktDiscDlCa

The following PM counter can be used for monitoring the

distribution of the UEs based on MIMO layer and transmission mode in the SCell:

- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioTxRankSCellDistr

If Elastic RAN flow is enabled on the existing TN port that is used for TN traffic,

Ethernet PM counters on the TN port also counts Elastic RAN traffic.

The counters are not supported in the following cases:

- The VlanPort MO encapsulates the EthernetPort MO using IDL.
- The VlanPort MO encapsulates the EthernetPort MO using TN that is not used for TN traffic.

Events

The INTERNAL\_PER\_BB\_EENB\_EVENT PM event is associated with the

Elastic RAN feature. The PM event is generated at eNodeB level reporting the

measurement for the external eNodeB partner for the corresponding PM counters.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Elastic RAN

## 9.1 Network Synchronization

Nodes in an Elastic RAN can be time- and phase-synchronized using the RAN Grand Master

feature on the Baseband Radio Node. For more information about this feature, see RAN Grand Master.

To configure network synchronization in Elastic RAN, at least one baseband node must have

a stable time synchronization source, such as a GNSS receiver. Time synchronization in

an Elastic RAN is distributed with the PTP protocol through the Ethernet links between

the nodes.

## 9.2 Guidelines for IDLe or TN Links

### 9.2.1 Configuration and Number of IDLe or TN Links

Depending on the number of IDL or TN/IDL ports, and TN ports used for Elastic RAN, the

following configurations are possible:

- Two directly connected eNodeBs. One IDL or TN/IDL port or dedicated TN port is used for each eNodeB. The IDLe link can be configured to pass through a switch to connect to the neighbor eNodeB, or can be a direct IDLe or TN connection between two eNodeBs. For a direct IDLe or TN connection, Elastic RAN carrier aggregation is limited to the two directly connected eNodeBs. Note: Do not install a secondary IDLe link if a split cable was purchased.
- Three directly connected eNodeBs. Two IDL or TN/IDL ports are used for each eNodeB, one for each neighbor eNodeB. The IDLe links are configured as direct connections between three mutually connected eNodeBs.

#### 9.2.1.1 Monitoring of IDLe or TN Links

The amount of E5 data received can be observed by two counters.

Without Elastic RAN

latency autoconfiguration, the

amount of E5 data that can

be

received

depends

on the configuration of the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay

attribute.

The

following PM counters can be used to observe the percentage of the data that is received

and sent for each RTT value:

- ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlRecDistr
- ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlTransDistr

With

Elastic RAN latency autoconfiguration, the amount of E5 data that can be received

depends on the RAN compute unit.

- The maximum allowed RTT is 60 µs for the following RAN compute units: Capacity module B for RAN Compute Group 3 and 4 in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module C in LTE Radio CPRI mode
- The maximum allowed RTT is 160 µs for the following RAN compute units: Capacity module A in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module B for RAN Compute Group 5 in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module A in LTE FDD AAS CPRI mode

For more information about the maximum Elastic RAN throughput, see

Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT

### 9.2.2 VLAN Configuration

Baseband units in one coordination group, that is, in one unit connected with fast

logical links, can be connected in the following ways:

- Using router For eNodeBs with individual VLAN IDs the associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRefVlanPort supporting that VLAN ID for connectivity.
- Directly through an IDLe connection For eNodeBs with direct connectivity over a different IDLe, the associated attribute is set to the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef attribute is set to the VlanPort supporting that IDLe for connectivity.

The ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef must always be set to a default

vlanPortRef and if further VLAN IDs are to be used, they are

configured under the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef.

VLAN configuration has the following limitations:

- If the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links are torn down. The only exception is when the value of the attribute is not set and then changed to a valid VLAN port.
- If the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction MO for which the change is performed are torn down. The only exception is when the value of the attribute is not set and then changed to a valid VLAN port.
- If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attributes of the VlanPort MO under the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links are torn down.
- If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attributes of the VlanPort MO under the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN, Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, and LTE PIM Avoidance links associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction MO for which change was performed are torn down.

Figure 3   VLAN Configuration between Baseband Units

### 9.2.3 Dimensioning

There are two levels of capacity dimensioning to support, either a peak load or a

cost-optimized level. There is one switch (x in the figure below) to aggregate the

traffic on each site. The dimensioning concerns the number of links between these two

switches.

The capacity need is typically higher than 10 Gbps, and there are no higher optical links

that are feasible for this case. The reason for the high capacity need is the

simultaneous requirements to manage very low delays and excessive bursts of traffic. The

solution is to provision a number of 10 Gbps links.

The peak load dimensioning can support Carrier Aggregation without having the link

aggregation between the switches as a bottleneck. Make the number of links the same as

the lowest number of Baseband units in either of the two sites.

Cost-optimized dimensioning is where the number of inter-switch links are kept to a

minimum. The dimensioning ensures the functionality of Elastic RAN and could result in

limitations for the Carrier Aggregation capacity.

Assume that N1 and N2 are the numbers of Baseband units in two separate sites, as shown

## 9.3 Elastic RAN Link Handling

The FastCoordinationGroup MO serves as a grouping point of eNodeBs

connected using Elastic RAN, containing the status information of the external eNodeBs.

During restarts, the FastCoordinationGroup is cleared and recreated

automatically.

The resetEranLink action on EranInterMeLink MO

triggers deconfiguration and setup procedures of the link connected to this MO. This

action separates EranInterMeLink handling from X2 handling, making it

possible to keep the X2 connection uninterrupted during link reset. When

EranInterMeLink MO is reset, the following actions are

performed:

- Disconnect EranInterMeLink with external node communication and without deleting the MO.
- Connect EranInterMeLink again with external node communication.

EranInterMeLink MO instances used for Elastic RAN carrier aggregation

can have the following RDN values:

- 1-1
- 1-2
- 1-3
- 1-4

The reselection action of Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature

can move an element form active to candidate list.

When an enabled link becomes disabled, but keeps the preconditions for its creation, it

stays in active list until reset action attempt.

When X2 connection is down, related active list and candidate list are removed. After the

X2 connection is re-established, the candidates for Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated

Multi-Point Reception are not added back to the list until next reselection.

Configuration for reselection procedure is set by parameter

ENodeBFunction.eranUlCompReSelectLinkTime. Lock and unlock action

on minimum one cell forces adding candidates to candidate list.

If Elastic RAN feature is deactivated, the EranInterMeLink remains on

the active list and the candidate list on the node with disabled license is empty. For

feature Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception

EranInterMeLink MOs are removed. Active and candidate lists are

cleared on the node. On external nodes the RBS ID of the node with deactivated feature

is removed from active and candidate lists.

## 9.4 Elastic RAN Synchronization for FDD

NGS can be used to give the tight time alignment needed between Baseband units when

running Carrier Aggregation over Elastic RAN. NGS has a Sync Provider and a Sync

Receiver node and they are synchronized over CPRI links through the RU.

For FDD-based networks, NGS can be used to give a tight time alignment (well within the

required 3 µs). This is required between the Baseband units in a site, when running

Carrier Aggregation, uplink CoMP over Elastic RAN.

Figure 6   Elastic RAN Using NGS and Synchronization Reference from PTS with Relaxed

Limits

Figure 6 shows a scenario with Carrier

Aggregation between two Baseband units in one site over Elastic RAN. PTS with relaxed

network limits is providing external time reference. PTS with relaxed network limits

gives a time accuracy of 0.5 ms, which by itself is not enough for Elastic RAN Carrier

Aggregation. NGS is used between the two Baseband units through one RU. It is required

that both Baseband unit are connected to the same radio and CPRI connection is used. For

NGS, an extra CPRI connection is used, connecting LTE Baseband to the same RU. This CPRI

link does not need to carry traffic. The NGS gives tight time alignment (well within the

required 3 µs), which is needed between the Baseband units when running Carrier

Aggregation.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: Elastic RAN: eMBMS Interworking

| Access Type:       | LTE                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Hardware Platform: | All Baseband products     |
| Licensing:         | Elastic RAN, FAJ 121 4608 |

When an eMBMS MBSFN area that includes an ESCell is activated or deactivated, the ESCell

is no longer scheduled for UEs which had the ESCell configured at the time of the MBSFN

area change. This is also true when the MBSFN subframe configuration is changed for a

specific ESCell.

The cell can be set up as an ESCell after the MBSFN area change. This can be done for any

UE, including UEs affected by the scheduling stop, after these UEs have had their RRC

connections released.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Elastic RAN enables TDD Carrier Aggregation in downlink direction across multiple eNBs.

It is more flexible in bands combinations for carrier aggregation over elastic RAN.

Elastic RAN provides increased performance due to improved frequency selectivity.

Throughput for UEs is improved by aggregation.

Capacity and Performance

One iDLe is required to carry inter-node Baseband traffic. The Transport Network

carrying fast baseband traffic will be more heavily loaded.

## Appendix A.d: 19.Q1: Same Physical Port in Baseband for Elastic RAN and Transport Network Traffic

This

feature enhancement allows Elastic RAN traffic on the TN ports along with TN traffic or on

dedicated TN ports.

| Feature Name:           | Elastic RAN         |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name:     | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Allowing Elastic RAN traffic on TN ports enables the possibility to reduce the number of

cables used by eNodeB. Outdoor scenarios using Elastic RAN are

possible by using optical cables.

Capacity and Performance

When Elastic RAN traffic is using TN port (10G), it adds approximately 3.7-µs delay

in each direction on a Baseband unit. TN traffic using jumbo frames can cause

additional delay on the Elastic RAN traffic.

Operation

When Elastic RAN flow is enabled on the existing TN port which is used for TN

traffic, Ethernet PM counters on the TN port also count Elastic RAN traffic.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

For Baseband units only.

## Appendix A.e: 19.Q1: Coexistence of Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

This enhancement allows the use of both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation on the same

eNodeB.

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| Access Type:            | LTE                                             |

This enhancement allows the simultaneous use of both Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier

Aggregation features on the same eNodeB by removing the restriction of coexistence of

Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation features on same eNodeB. Parallel use

of both of those features enables more carrier aggregation partners, and improves

carrier aggregation on border areas between two networks. This enhancement also allows

to use a single Cell as E-RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation partner at the same

time.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement provides more External SCell candidates in the border area between

Elastic RAN and X2 connected eNodeBs that leads to an increase in utilization of

multiple eNodeBs in this area.

The following existing PM counters can be used to observe the benefits of the

enhancement:

- pmCaActDlIeNbSum
- pmCaScheduledDlIeNbSum
- pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt

This enhancement has a minor impact on X2 load because of the following:

- An increase in size of X2 private messages
- A minor increase of memory usage due to new parameters
- An increase on processor load due to additional computing required due to more frequent ESCell evaluation

Operation

This enhancement depends on both Elastic RAN and LAA licenses to be operable,

external secondary LAA cells can be used for carrier aggregation only when Elastic

RAN and LAA licenses are operable on both master eNodeB and external eNodeB Elastic

RAN partners.

The LAA ESCell and PCell relations in Elastic RAN CA are defined by

EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed MO. This MO references

ExternalEUtranCellTDD representing LAA ESCell. Because the

ExternalEUtranCellTdd.eutranFrequencyRef is mandatory

reference to EUtranFrequency object an special EUtranFrequency needs to be created

and referenced by an LAA ExternalEUtranCellTDD object with an

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.arfcnValueEUtranDl equal to 47000 needs

to be created and referenced by an LAA ExternalEUtranCellTDD object.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Increasing the number of possible Elastic RAN partners for Carrier Aggregation, allows

for making use of deployments with a large number of carriers and nodes with partly

overlapping coverage.

Capacity and Performance

Better performance can be achieved because of more optimal selection of partners for

Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

## Appendix A.h: 20.Q1: Elastic RAN Model Enhancements

This

enhancement enables Elastic RAN link reset without interrupting the X2 connection, and

improves Elastic RAN observability.

| Feature Name:           | Elastic RAN         |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4608        |

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Benefits

Users can manually reset EranInterMeLink MO by the

resetEranLink action, without interrupting X2 connection.

Clear status information for eNodeBs using Elastic RAN links is visible on the new

FastCoordinationGroup MO.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

A new action is introduced under EranInterMeLink MO. The new

resetEranLink action resets the corresponding Elastic RAN

link. During reset, the link becomes disabled and the Elastic RAN traffic that

utilized this link is temporarily

stopped.

If the link reset action is not successful, the EranInterMeLink

is removed.

The new FastCoordinationGroup MO is created automatically under

ENodeBFunction, serving as a grouping point of each external

eNodeBs. This MO is created unconditionally, regardless of licenses and feature

activation. If Elastic RAN is not active, the MO remains empty. The status

information is listed in the following attributes:

The

Elastic RAN functionality is supported between three directly interconnected Baseband units

without using a router.

| Feature Name:           | Elastic RAN         | Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception   |
|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4608        | FAJ 121 4856                                           |
| Value Package Name:     | Elastic RAN         | CoMP                                                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0568        | FAJ 801 0442                                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node | Baseband Radio Node                                    |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 | LTE                                                    |

Benefits

Delay and congestion caused by the router can be avoided by directly interconnecting

three Baseband units. The Baseband units are interconnected by Inter-ME Link (IML)

connection on IDLe ports.

The Elastic RAN and Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception features can

be active simultaneously with the following characteristics:

- VLAN ports with different VLAN identities can be configured
- Different IDLe ports must be used.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

ExternalEnbFunction.eranvlanPortRef parameters are used for

configuring VLAN ports that reference different physical IDLe ports for Elastic RAN.

ExternalEnbFunction.eranUlCompVlanPortRef parameters are used

for configuring VLAN ports that reference different physical IDLe ports for Elastic

RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature is applicable for Baseband 5216 and Baseband 6630.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 19.1 or later is required for this enhancement.

## Appendix A.k: 20.Q4: Extended Latency between Baseband Units for Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation

The latency threshold settings are updated with a value that enables having longer

distances between eNodeBs in an Elastic RAN

cluster.

| Feature Name:           | Elastic RAN         |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name:     | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                 |

Benefits

The enhancement introduces the 160 µs latency threshold value for Elastic RAN

connections. This enables communication between Baseband units at a longer distance

for UEs using carrier aggregation.

With this enhancement, equipment with higher latency can be used, which reduces

equipment cost.

Macro cell offloading enables having less load on macro cells and higher load on

micro cells. It also allows for higher latency, so more SCells are available for the

UE to choose from.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink throughput is improved because CA-capable UEs can access more SCells.

Operation

The 160 µs threshold value is introduced for the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute.

For Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception, setting the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute to 160

µs prevents the setup of Elastic RAN links.

To measure the number of TTIs based on the threshold value set in

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay, the following

counters are introduced:

- ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlRecDistr
- ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlTransDistr

The Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised when

there is latency configuration mismatch between nodes on the same link.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

If the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute is set

to 160 µs, Elastic RAN carrier aggregation is disabled for the following Baseband

units:

- Baseband 5212
- Baseband 6303
- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 5216 in mixed mode
- Baseband 6318 in mixed mode
- Baseband 6630 in mixed mode

Setting the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRttDelay attribute

to 160 µs does not disable Elastic RAN carrier aggregation for the following

Baseband units:

- Baseband 5216 in single mode
- Baseband 6318 in single mode
- Baseband 6630 in single mode

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.3 or later is required for this feature enhancement.

If the Release Independence ENM feature  is enabled, ENM version 19.3 or later is

required.

## Appendix A.l: 20.Q4: Coexistence of Elastic RAN and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation

This enhancement allows operators to have active licenses for Elastic RAN and

Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation. As a result, the number of possible carrier aggregation

partners increases.

| Feature Name:           | Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation   | Elastic RAN         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4469                       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name:     | Advanced Carrier Aggregation       | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0564                       | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                | LTE                 |

This enhancement introduces the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPrioritizationDisabled MOM attribute

to replace the zzzTemporary1 attribute. This attribute is effective

only if licenses for both Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation and Elastic RAN are active on

the node.

Benefits

With this enhancement, the eNodeB can use external cells over both Inter-eNodeB and

Elastic RAN links at the same time for Carrier Aggregation.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPrioritizationDisabled attribute

helps to determine whether Elastic RAN Carrier Aggregation has to be prioritized

over Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following changes:

- The mechanism for monitoring the latency between Baseband units is updated to support more accurate E5 latency measurements.
- E-RAN partner allocation is enhanced to prevent data overallocation to an ESCell with UEs from multiple partner Baseband units.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- E5 latency measurements between Baseband units are more stable and accurate, which enables deployments with more distant Baseband units.
- E-RAN carrier aggregation throughput is increased in the downlink.

Capacity and Performance

The E-RAN carrier aggregation throughput of ESCells with UEs from multiple partner

Baseband units is increased in the downlink. This improvement can be observed with

the following PM counters:

## Appendix A.p: 23.Q2: Elastic RAN Latency Autoconfiguration

This feature enhancement supports automatic latency measurements and

configuration.

| Feature Name           | Elastic RAN         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name     | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the following changes:

- The E-RAN traffic latency is measured automatically.
- The latency threshold for E-RAN traffic is set automatically.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The maximum throughput between two carrier aggregating Elastic RAN nodes can increase in the downlink.
- The manual workload of operators is decreased.

Capacity and Performance

The maximum throughput between two carrier aggregating Elastic RAN nodes can increase

in the downlink, if E-RAN tunnel link latency is 20-160 µs. This change can be

observed in the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlScellEran
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellEran

E-RAN tunnel link latency can be observed with the following read-only attributes:

- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency1minAvg
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency15minHWM
- EranInterMeLink.linkLatency24hrsHWM

CPRI link one-way delay can be observed with the following PM counters:

- RiLink.pmLinkDelayHigh
- RiLink.pmLinkDelayLow

Operation

With this feature enhancement, the operator does not need to set the

ExternalENodeBFunction.eranLinkMaxRTTDelay attribute, as the

value of this attribute is not used by the eNodeB. Instead, the maximum allowed

delay for the E5 link depends on the RAN compute unit:

- The maximum allowed RTT is 60 µs for the following RAN Compute units: Capacity module B for RAN Compute Group 3 and 4 in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module C in LTE Radio CPRI mode
- The maximum allowed RTT is 160 µs for the following RAN Compute units: Capacity module A in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module B for RAN Compute Group 5 in LTE Radio CPRI mode Capacity module A in LTE FDD AAS CPRI mode

With this feature enhancement, the

ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlRecDistr and the

ENodeBFunction.pmEranThpVolDlTransDistr PM counters also do

not take effect.

This feature enhancement introduces the Elastic RAN tunnel link latency

exceeds maximum allowed value. alarm text to the Inter Node Carrier Aggregation Service Unavailable

alarm.

The Inconsistent Configuration alarm is also updated to be

raised with the Elastic RAN cannot be activated towards remote eNodeB.

Values of eranLinkMaxRttDelay do not match. alarm text, if this

feature enhancement is not used for at least one pair of eNodeBs.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is only supported for non-TDD AAS and non-RGW

configurations.

This feature enhancement is only supported on RAN Compute Group 3, 4b, and 5 on LTE

Radio CPRI mode and RAN Compute Group 3b, 3c, and 5 on LTE FDD AAS CPRI mode. For

more information, see  Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN

and Massive IoT RAN.

## Appendix A.q: 24.Q2.0: Observability Enhancement for Elastic RAN Software Release Compatibility

This feature enhancement introduces a MOM attribute to increase the observability of

Elastic RAN software release compatibility between eNodeBs that are involved in Elastic RAN

carrier aggregation.

| Feature Name           | Elastic RAN         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name     | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces a MOM attribute to increase the observability of

software release compatibility between eNodeBs that are involved in Elastic RAN

carrier aggregation. The value of the attribute shows this software release

compatibility independent of the software release compatibility between eNodeBs that

are involved in inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

TermPointToENB.eranCaSwCompatibility attribute to observe

software release compatibility between eNodeBs that are involved in Elastic RAN

carrier aggregation. If the value of the attribute is INCOMPATIBLE

or UNKNOWN, no baseband-to-baseband connection can be set up for

Elastic RAN carrier aggregation between the eNodeBs. If the value of the attribute

is UNKNOWN, it means that the Elastic RAN feature in not activated

on the local or remote eNodeB, or the remote eNodeB software version is prior to

24.Q2.

If the Elastic RAN feature is not activated on the remote eNodeB, the

Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is no

longer raised with the following additional text: Elastic RAN feature is not

activated in remote eNodeB.

With this feature enhancement, the

TermPointToENB.interEnbSwCompatibilityState attribute only

shows the inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation software release compatibility.

The descriptions of the following Elastic RAN-related struct members of the

ENodeBFunction.interNodalProtVersions attribute are

updated:

- eRanCaProtVerExact
- eRanUlCompProtVerExact

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

## Appendix A.r: 24.Q2.5: Changed Behavior of Inter Node Feature Incompatibility Alarm for Elastic RAN

This correction specifies the behavior of the Inter Node Feature

Incompatibility alarm when the Elastic RAN feature is used.

| Feature Name           | Elastic RAN         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4608        |
| Value Package Name     | Elastic RAN         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0568        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           |

Description of Correction

For one pair of eNodeBs trying to establish Elastic RAN carrier aggregation, the

Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm is no

longer raised with the Elastic RAN feature is not activated in remote

eNodeB. additional text if all the following conditions are

met:

- Both eNodeBs run software version of 24.Q2 or higher.
- The Elastic RAN feature is not activated on the remote eNodeB.
- The ESCell is not an LAA cell.
- The operationalState attribute of the PCell is ENABLED.

For one pair of eNodeBs, if one of the nodes runs a software version of 24.Q2 or

higher and the other node runs a software version lower than 24.Q2, the

Inter Node Feature Incompatibility alarm might be

raised with the Elastic RAN feature is not activated in remote

eNodeB. additional text. This is because the Elastic RAN carrier

aggregation cannot be set up because of software version incompatibility as the

ESCell is considered deactivated even if the Elastic RAN feature is activated on the

node.

In other cases, the behavior of the alarm is not changed.
