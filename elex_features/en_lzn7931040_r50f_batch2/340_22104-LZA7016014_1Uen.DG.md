# 1 Assisted Time Holdover Overview

The Assisted Time Holdover feature is a network synchronization feature. It reduces the

periods of service interruption when the primary time synchronization source fails, as long

as there are no faults with the assistant.

Summary

Extending time holdover has the following results:

- The availability of TDD and FDD services that require time synchronization is extended during a time reference outage.
- The operator can plan on-site maintenance actions in normal working hours.

The supported assisting reference types are the following:

- G.8275.1 PTP over Ethernet (AFTS)
- G.8275.2 APTS PTP over IP (APTS)
- G.8262 SyncE
- Over-the-Air synchronization (OTA)

For NR TDD only, Assisted Time Holdover function is available with Over-the-Air

assisting synchronization reference. For details, see Over-the-Air Assisted

Time Holdover in NR CPI library.

Table 1 shows the combinations of assisting

references and primary references.

# 3 Feature Operation of Assisted Time Holdover

The operation of the Assisted Time Holdover feature varies depending on the assisting

time reference.

Feature Operation of Assisted Time Holdover with APTS as the Assisting Time

Reference

Figure 1   Network View of APTS

The following conditions apply to this assisting reference type:

- An assisting PTP over IP unicast association is set up to the RAN grandmaster.
- When the GNSS time references are available, the RBS determines the time offset based on the difference between the GNSS time and the time received from the PTP grandmaster through the IP connection.
- When the GNSS time reference is lost, the RBS retains the time value based on the received PTP messages. This way, it compensates the loss with the latest calculated time offset.
- The assisting APTS time reference can be selected on startup without the need for the one-hour reevaluation period if the value of the RadioEquipmentClock.startWithPreservedAssistingOffset attribute is set to ALL. The following requirements must be met before the Baseband Radio Node starts up: The primary time reference must be active for at least one hour, with the RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute reporting RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED or TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED. The AssistingReference.operationalState attribute must report ENABLED.

Feature Operation of Assisted Time Holdover with AFTS as the Assisting Time

Reference

Figure 2   Network View of Assisting AFTS with GNSS

The following conditions apply to this assisting reference type:

- An assisting PTP over Ethernet multicast association is set up to the PTP grandmaster.
- When the GNSS time references are available, the RBS calculates the time difference between the GNSS time and the time received from the PTP grandmaster across the PTP network. As a result, the RBS calculates the time offset.
- When the GNSS time reference is lost, the RBS holds up the time, based on the received PTP messages, and compensates with the latest calculated time offset.

Feature Operation of Assisted Time Holdover with SyncE as the Assisting Time

Reference

The following conditions apply to this assisting reference type:

- When GNSS or PTP time reference is lost and there is at least one assisting reference available with the AssistingReference.assistedReferenceStatus attribute set to NO\_FAULT, the assisting reference selection is triggered.
- Assisting reference selection is based on the received quality level and priority only.
- APTS, AFTS and OTA have precedence over assisting SyncE if it has the same quality level and priority.
- If SyncE is the most suitable assisting reference based on the quality level and priority, it is selected and applied to maintain required accuracy after GNSS or PTP is lost.Note: In a cascaded setup, Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary clocks distribute SyncE to cascaded Ericsson Baseband nodes within one hop. Cascaded Baseband nodes use the SyncE source as assisting reference.
- When the actual quality of the source is better than the received quality level, the SyncE reference can be remapped to the configured quality level.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary clocks

to use SyncE and OTA as assisting time references.

The feature enhancement also allows Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary

clocks to distribute SyncE in assisted mode to cascaded Baseband nodes. This allows

cascaded Baseband nodes to synchronize with the Baseband node configured as boundary

clock. The following limitations apply:

- Only Baseband nodes within one hop of each other are supported.
- Only Ericsson Baseband nodes are supported.
- Baseband nodes that are configured as PTP grandmasters are not supported.

This feature enhancement provides the benefit of prolonged time holdover. If the GNSS

or PTP G.2875.1 primary reference fails, Baseband nodes that are configured as

boundary clocks use SyncE or OTA as an assisting reference.

Capacity and Performance

If the primary reference fails, but a SyncE or OTA assisting reference is available,

this feature enhancement keeps time-dependent services enabled. As a result, the

value of the RadioEquipmentClock.timeAssistedHoldoverSec PM

counter continues to increase.

This impact is applicable to the following nodes:

- Baseband nodes that are configured as boundary clocks
- Cascaded Baseband nodes

Operation

The IEEE 1588 Boundary Clock feature (FAJ 121 4755) must be activated to use this

feature enhancement.

Summary and Benefits

With this feature enhancement, a previously calculated time offset value preserved in

the memory is used to compensate for the loss of the GNSS time reference, without

the need for the one-hour reevaluation period. For this, the assisting APTS time

reference must be qualified and determined to be usable before any interruptions on

the Baseband Radio Node.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The availability of TDD and FDD services that require time synchronization is extended when the Baseband Radio Node is forced to restart and GNSS is unavailable, such as power outages because of extreme environmental conditions.
- The operator has more time available to plan on-site maintenance actions to fix issues related to the GNSS outage.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement extends cell availability time.

Operation

To use this feature enhancement, the

RadioEquipmentClock.startWithPreservedAssistingOffset

attribute must be set to ALL, and the following requirements must

be met before the Baseband Radio Node starts up:

- The primary time reference must be active for at least one hour, with the RadioEquipmentClock.radioClockState attribute reporting RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED or TIME\_OFFSET\_LOCKED.
- The AssistingReference.operationalState attribute must report ENABLED.

After the Baseband Radio Node starts up, the APTS reference is selected as the

synchronization source, and the system compensates for the lost primary time

reference based on the preserved time offset.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 24.2 or later is required to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature enhancement.
