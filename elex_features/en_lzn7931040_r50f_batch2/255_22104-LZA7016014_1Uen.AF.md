The TM7 Mode Switching enables automatic switching between TM7 and TM3. The automatic

switching increases the throughput or the coverage depending on the radio

conditions.

This is because the co-scheduling                                 capability can get lost and the total cell performance can become                                 degraded. |

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

No network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of TM7 Mode Switching

The TM7 Mode Switching feature chooses the optimal transmission mode based on the

channel condition.

The TM7 Mode Switching feature enables the UE to transit back and forth between TM3 and

TM7 depending on channel quality in order to maximize throughput or coverage.

# 4 Network Impact of TM7 Mode Switching

With the TM7 Mode Switching feature better UE throughput performance is achieved over

TM7 or TM3 alone.

Capacity and Performance

In high SNR conditions the feature improves coverage, capacity and throughput by

switching to TM3 mode provided the channel quality is good.

To cell edge users, the feature improves coverage, capacity and provides better

throughput by switching to TM7 mode.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 8 Deactivate TM7 Mode Switching

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011326 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
