Summary

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature enables incoming

WCDMA handover handling and handover initiation to WCDMA cells at poor coverage. To

detect poor coverage in the serving cell, A2 measurement is used. With this

feature, the capabilities of the following features are extended:

- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity
- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage

The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature offers the following benefits:

- Reduced interruptions of data flows during the session transition process.
- Enhanced control over the transfer of UEs between frequencies and cells.
- Using handover to transfer the UE enables the target node to use different admission criteria than at a plain connection setup. This improves the probability that a service, for example VoIP, is not interrupted in a network with high load.

The feature can be used to help offloading an LTE cell, depending on measurement

threshold settings. Better offloading can be achieved with higher threshold values

of, for example, poor coverage. By using offloading, different RATs in the network

can serve users more efficiently.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The network must have UEs capable of WCDMA handover. This is indicated by FGI bit 8

in the UE-EUTRA-Capability IE, as described in 3GPP TS

36.331.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover

When poor coverage is detected, the eNodeB determines the target frequencies, and

decides the WCDMA mobility action if a WCDMA frequency is selected. The feature enables the

eNodeB to initiate blind or measurement-based handovers to WDCMA cells.

Mobility in Poor Coverage

The feature uses the A2 measurement process to detect poor coverage

in the serving cell. The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature determines the conditions

under which the eNodeB considers a UE in poor coverage. It also decides the conditions that

trigger the eNodeB to configure a B2 measurement in the UE.

The eNodeB determines what frequencies (LTE or other RATs) are target candidates for

transferring the UE. If the highest prioritized frequency that the UE has capabilities for

is a WCDMA frequency, the eNodeB can do one of the following actions:

| Blind RwR action             |    | When the UE is in sufficiently poor coverage and does not have voice bearers, the               eNodeB can release the UE with a redirection indication. In this case, the UE is               redirected to the available WCDMA frequency.                                                                   |
|------------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                              |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Measurement-based RwR action |    | The eNodeB can start an B2 measurement in the UE to check if the UE has               coverage for a cell on the WCDMA frequency. The eNodeB waits until the UE sends a               report for the B2 measurement, and releases the UE with a redirection indication for               the WCDMA frequency. |

The feature extends the RwR options with the following actions:

| Blind WCDMA handover action             |    | When the UE is in sufficiently poor coverage, the eNodeB can initiate a handover for               the UE to a cell on the target WCDMA frequency. This WCDMA frequency is detected by               the eNodeB to cover the source cell completely.                       |
|-----------------------------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                         |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Measurement-based WCDMA handover action |    | The eNodeB can start an B2 measurement in the UE to check if the UE has               coverage for a cell on the WCDMA frequency. The eNodeB receives the measurement report               and initiates a handover for the UE to one of the cells received in the report. |

The eNodeB handles incoming WCDMA handover requests (using only the S1 connection) as it

handles incoming LTE handovers.

The feature is required

to handover the PS bearers, when existing at the same time as the voice bearer, to the WCDMA

system in an SRVCC handover to UTRAN.

The feature is only mandatory for simultaneous HO of voice and data to WCDMA, that is, HO

of voice connection works without this feature.

If the SRVCC Handover to UTRAN feature is deactivated and the Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature is activated, QCI1

(voice session) is dropped during IRAT handover to WCDMA.

If there is ongoing voice session,

IRAT handovers to WCDMA  can be prevented in the following ways:

- By tuning attributes from the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility feature
- By setting the UtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute to -1

Handover Target Cell Selection

The difference between blind and

measurement-based handover target selection is the following:

| Target selection for blind handover             |    | The target cell of the handover is chosen based on                             preconfigured information, and not based on measurements performed by                             the UE.   |
|-------------------------------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Target selection for measurement-based handover |    | The target cell of the handover is chosen                             based on a target measurement report received from the UE.                                                           |

Triggering WCDMA Handover

The following criteria must be fulfilled before a WCDMA handover can be triggered:

- The Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover feature must be operable.
- The UE must be capable of handover to a WCDMA cell.
- The information about the target frequency and cell must be configured in the eNodeB.

Triggering conditions of WCDMA handover for UEs can vary between features.

For more information on WCDMA handover triggering conditions, see Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity and

Mobility Control at Poor Coverage.

Process Steps

The process steps of outgoing WCDMA handover preparation are the following:

1. The eNodeB selects a WCDMA frequency as a candidate target for transferring the UE.
2. The eNodeB chooses one of the following the actions: Transfer the UE with a blind RwR. Transfer the UE with a blind handover. Start an B2 measurement in the UE.
3. If the B2 measurement is started, the eNodeB waits for the resulting report. After receiving the measurement reports, the eNodeB decides the mobility action to use when transferring the UE to the target frequency. The eNodeB can choose between a RwR or a handover to one of the cells included in the measurement report.

The eNodeB prepares and executes the WCDMA handover attempt the same way as an intra-LTE

handover. For more information, see Intra-LTE Handover. Compared to the intra-LTE handover, the WCDMA handover process

has the following differences:

- The target node is a WCDMA RNC node.
- The connection used when communicating with the node handling the target cell is the S1 connection. This means that the communication goes through the core network and the MME.

A WCDMA handover is considered successful if at least one of the UE bearers is accepted and

established in the WCDMA target cell.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover

The feature provides enhanced active mode mobility between LTE and WCDMA cells or

frequencies in the network. Correct configuration is required to ensure successful

handover.

When the feature is active, the UE can be directed to do a handover to a WCDMA cell while

maintaining the data session. The feature allows UEs coming from a WCDMA cell to be handed

over to an LTE cell.

Considering outgoing WCDMA handover, correct configuration of the feature is required to

ensure the following results:

- The UE is transferred to a WCDMA cell for which the UE has coverage.
- A B2 measurement is configured in the UE whenever blind handover is not possible.
- When at least one target cell that covers the source cell completely is available, the UE performs the handover directly, without a B2 measurement.

No special configuration is needed to be able to perform an incoming handover from a WCDMA

cell.

## 9.1 Configuration for Outgoing WCDMA Handover

For a WCDMA cell to be usable as target cell for handover, attributes containing

information about the target WCDMA cell location must be set to values different than default.

The configuration must be completed for blind and measurement-based handovers as

well.

The

ENodeBFunction.rRCContSizeLimit attribute can be used to configure the

size limit of the Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container IE,

which is used in the S1AP Handover Required message. The truncation of the

UE Capability Information message is performed above the value configured

with this attribute.

The default and recommended value of the ENodeBFunction.rRCContSizeLimit

attribute is 1823. This is also the setting for the worst case scenario, when

the MSC only supports the IE size up to 1823 bytes. If the value of the attribute is too high,

the number of unsuccessful handovers increases. With a correct value configuration, handovers

can be executed successfully despite the limitations of

GSM

and WCDMA networks.

The following parameters of the candidate cell MO instance

must be set to values different than the default value:

| lac   |    | Location Area Code.  Must be sent to the MME to identify the target SGSN that serves the                             target WCDMA RNC.                               |
|-------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       |    |                                                                                                                                                                      |
| rac   |    | Routing Area Code.  Must be sent to the MME to be able to identify the target SGSN in the                             target location area of the target WCDMA cell. |

For an ExternalUtranCellFDD MO instance, it is recommended to

set the ExternalUtranCellFDD.lac and the

ExternalUtranCellFDD.rac attributes at the creation of the MO

instance.

## 9.2 Configuration for Blind WCDMA Handover

Configurations are needed to indicate that blind handover can be used for a WCDMA

target frequency.

To indicate that blind handover can be used for the selected WCDMA target frequency, the

following configuration must be fulfilled in the eNodeB:

- The EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute must be set to TRUE in the serving cell.
- The UtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute must have the value HANDOVER.
- Under the UtranFreqRelation MO, a UtranCellRelation MO instance must exist where the attributes are set the following way: The UtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to COVERS. This indicates that the target cell covers the serving cell completely and that it is safe to send the UE without measuring. The UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to TRUE. The available member of the UtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to TRUE. This cell relation represents the target cell in the resulting blind handover.

## 9.3 Configuration for Measurement-Based WCDMA Handover

Configurations are needed to indicate that measurement-based handover can be used for a

WCDMA target frequency.

To indicate that measurement-based handover can be used for the selected WCDMA target

frequency, the following configuration must be fulfilled in the eNodeB:

- If the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is active, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN attribute must be set to true. Otherwise, the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute must be set to true.
- The UtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute must have the value HANDOVER.
- For every candidate target cell, a UtranCellRelation MO instance where the UtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true must exist under the UtranFreqRelation MO.
