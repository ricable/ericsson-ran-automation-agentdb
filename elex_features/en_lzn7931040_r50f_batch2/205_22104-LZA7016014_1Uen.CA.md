# 1 Minimization of Drive Tests Overview

The Minimization of Drive Tests feature enables the operator to replace physical

drive tests with remote collection of the same information using UEs and existing traffic in

the network.

Summary

The Minimization of Drive Tests feature provides a remote method for troubleshooting

or verification of the radio network that is simpler and cheaper than traditional

drive tests. The feature provides a tool to optimize network planning with the MDT

measurement data, including location information.

The traditional drive test, where vehicles with measurement equipment are used for

analyzing network coverage and capacity, is costly and requires planning and

coordination of resources. In the field, it is desirable to use automated drive test

solutions, involving UEs, for easier operation.

3GPP specified MDT so that standard mobiles can be used for measurements to provide

data for the operators. This includes GNSS location information if available in the

UEs. The feature provides a simpler, cheaper, and remote method to use for

troubleshooting or verification of the radio network.

Network Requirements

The ManagementBasedMdtAllowed IE is used in MME to support user

consent at initial context setup and handover for Area-based MDT. This IE is

provided in the S1 INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST

message and in the S1/X2 HANDOVER REQUEST message

described in 3GPP TS 36.413, S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) and

3GPP TS 36.423, X2 Application Protocol (X2AP).

For the UE to report GNSS location information to eNodeB,

StandaloneGNSS-Location-r10 is used. This parameter

indicates whether the UE is equipped with a standalone GNSS receiver that can be

used to provide detailed location information. This is included in the RRC

measurement report as described in 3GPP TS 36.331, Radio Resource Control

(RRC); Protocol specification.

# 3 Feature Operation of Minimization of Drive Tests

The Minimization of Drive Tests feature gathers information of the network from the

measurements collected by the UE. It helps to set up LTE networks with maximum coverage and

supports QoS.

This feature provides the Area-based Immediate MDT and the Area-based Logged MDT. The

measurement data is collected in a defined area. The purpose of MDT is to gather information

of the current network from measurements taken by the UE. In addition to the measurements

taken by the UE, there are measurement collections carried out by the eNodeB to monitor the

QoS related data and to monitor UL and DL quality. Therefore, the MDT helps to set up LTE

networks with maximum coverage, and to support QoS.

For the network deployment, Figure 1 shows

interfaces among OSS, MME, and eNodeB.

Figure 1   LTE RAN Network Overview

The MO MdtConfiguration that represents the E-UTRA Report Configuration

for MDT is configured per eNodeB. The operator can reconfigure MDT configurations, but this

does not affect connected UEs. These can only be affected when new connections are set up, at

the next UE context setup.

## 3.1 Operational Process of Area-based Immediate MDT

Area-based Immediate MDT involves measurement collection by the UE in Connected Mode in

a specified area. Data is reported to the eNodeB and the OSS.

Activation of Area-based Immediate MDT

Figure 2   Activation of Area-based Immediate MDT

The feature makes it possible for the operator to enable or disable MDT measurements for

each configured frequency separately. All configured frequencies can be disabled,

including intra-frequency measurements. In addition, when performing inter-frequency

measurements, the feature enables the operator to select whether a measurement gap should

be used.

The measurement data are observed in the specific MDT PM events. For this feature, M1,

M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, and M7 measurements are provided. The MDT PM events are stored in the

Cell Trace ROP files and sent to the destination by streaming.

- M1: RSRP and RSRQ measurement by UE. This report can contain detailed location information optionally if available in the UE. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.214, Physical layer; Measurements.
- M2: Power Headroom (PH) measurement by UE. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.213, Physical layer procedures.
- M3: Received Interference Power measurement by eNodeB. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.214, Physical layer; Measurements.
- M4: Data Volume measurement separately for DL and UL, for each QCI and UE, and by eNodeB. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.314, Layer 2; Measurements.
- M5: Scheduled IP Throughput measurement separately for downlink and uplink, for each QCI and UE, by eNodeB. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.314, Layer2; Measurements.
- M6: Packet Delay measurement separately for downlink and uplink. The measurement for uplink is done by the UE for QCI for each UE, and by the eNodeB for each QCI for downlink.
- M7: Packet Loss rate measurement separately for downlink and uplink, for each QCI and UE. The measurement is done by the eNodeB.

The M1 measurement reported from a UE covers both intra-frequency and inter-frequency

measurements. These are used to monitor and detect coverage problems in the network. The M3,

M4, M5, M6, and M7 measurements are provided to monitor the QoS related measurement data,

uplink and downlink quality. The measurement results are observed in the specific PM events

as described in Performance of Minimization of Drive Tests.

The operator can resume MDT by adding specific MDT PM events to a new or existing Cell

Trace Subscription profile in the OSS.

If MDT activation is triggered the M3 measurement is collected periodically by eNodeB

with 60 seconds granularity. For this to occur, there must be a valid license in the

eNodeB.

When the eNodeB selects suitable MDT UEs for M1, M2, M4, M5, M6, and M7 measurements, the

following happens:

- The M2, M4, M5, M6 (downlink), and M7 measurements are triggered to all the MDT UEs.
- The eNodeB triggers RRC connection reconfiguration to send MDT configuration to all the MDT UEs for M1 or M6 (uplink) measurements, or both.
- The M1 and M6 (uplink) measurements can contain the GNSS location information of the UE. This information is included in the measurement report if available in the UE when the measurement was taken.
- The M1 event is generated by the M1 measurement of the UE. Depending on the configuration, measurement reports are sent periodically from the UE, or when trigger conditions are met.
- The M6 (uplink) event is generated by the PDCP Packet Delay uplink measurement of the UE. Depending on the configuration, measurement reports are sent periodically from the UE.

Incoming UEs that handover in the cell, or are connected or re-established in the cell,

are reconfigured for MDT activation.

To avoid disturbing ordinary traffic, the eNodeB reconfigures all MDT measurements of the

UE with a periodicity of 1 second for each UE.

The MDT PM events are stored in the Cell Trace ROP files and are sent to the destination

by streaming.

Deactivation of Area-based Immediate MDT

Figure 3   Deactivation of Area-based Immediate MDT

To stop measurement collection, the operator suspends the activated LTE Cell Trace profile

that MDT PM events are included in OSS. The following occurs:

- The eNodeB deactivates M2, M3, M4, M5, M6 (downlink only), and M7 measurement events.
- The eNodeB triggers the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure to remove MDT configuration from all activated MDT UEs with periodicity of 1 second for each UE.

### 3.1.1 Disabling Inter-Frequency Measurements Triggered by Area-based Immediate MDT

Inter-frequency measurements triggered by Area-based Immediate MDT can be disabled in

a subscriber group for downlink and uplink UE throughput improvement.

If the UE is in a subscriber group, the inter-frequency measurements triggered by

Area-based Immediate MDT can be disabled. This is possible if the measurements need

measurement gap.

For disabling the measurements, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.featuresToDisableMeas attribute must

include the value that corresponds the Minimization of Drive Tests feature name.

With the disabled inter-frequency measurements, the downlink and uplink throughput

improves for the UE. However, the collection of remote information from measurement

reports cannot be accomplished.

## 3.2 Operational Process of Area-based Logged MDT

With Area-based Logged MDT, the UE logs measurements in Idle Mode for a specified

area. Data is reported to the eNodeB and the OSS.

Activation of Area-based Logged MDT

Figure 4   Activation of Area-based Logged MDT

MDT is configured for each eNodeB. The UE configuration procedure is initiated when

the UE enters INACTIVE state. The eNodeB configures Logged MDT for

suitable UEs in the following cases:

- The Logged MDT configuration is enabled with the LoggedMdt.loggedMdtConfigEnabled MO attribute.
- No MDT log is available when UE enters CONNECTED mode.

If an MDT log is available, there is no MDT configuration procedure at that time.

The LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message is used to configure the

UE to perform measurement logging results while in RRC\_IDLE

state.

If the UE GNSS capability check for the Logged MDT configuration is enabled, GNSS

capability is mandatory for UE selection.

Retrieval of Area-based Logged MDT

Figure 5   Retrieval of Area-based Logged MDT

If MDT measurement logs are available, the cell can trigger the retrieval procedure

when the UE enters INACTIVE state. The MDT license and the

LoggedMdt.loggedMdtReportEnabled attribute should be checked

before the retrieval procedure.

The Logged MDT retrieval procedure is initiated only if at least one Cell Trace

scanner with the RRC\_UE\_INFORMATION\_RESPONSE event is active

for the cell. The Cell Trace scanner can have one of the following modes:

- FILE (default)
- STREAMING
- FILE\_AND\_STREAMING

Using limited configuration in FILE mode prevents a possible

overflow of received MDT logs in the PM file storage. If an overflow occurs, the

eNodeB still sends and receives log requests from the UE, but it is unable to store

those requests.

If the STREAMING mode is available, it is recommended to choose

STREAMING or FILE\_AND\_STREAMING mode to avoid

possible log loss.

UEs can store non-retrieved MDT logs for 48 hours. Therefore, it is possible to

retrieve MDT logs without losing measurement data. The Logged MDT retrieval

procedure is suspended if the following conditions are met:

- There is no MDT license.
- The load state of the MP is HIGH or above.

The logged measurement configuration does not have a release mechanism in the eNodeB.

The UE discards the configuration and measurement logs in the following cases:

- The logging duration expires.
- The UE receives a new Logged MDT configuration.
- The UE power is off.

## 3.3 Radio Link Failure and RRC Connection Establishment Failure Reporting

RLF and RRC Connection Establishment Failure Reporting are measurement collections

that enhance troubleshooting and problem detection.

The reports are collected when the Minimization of Drive Tests feature is activated. The

Cell Trace mechanism is used for activating the retrieval procedure. Measurement logs

are retrieved independently on the UEs with GNSS location information.

If RLF and RRC Connection Establishment Failure measurement logs are available, the cell

can trigger the retrieval procedure when UE enters INACTIVE state.

Before the retrieval procedure, check the following:

- MDT license
- MdtConfiguration.rlfReportEnabled = TRUE
- MdtConfiguration.rcefReportEnabled = TRUE

RLF and RRC Connection Establishment Failure reports are not retrieved

if the load state

of the MP is HIGH or

above.

## 3.4 MDT Data Access

Only personnel who have a valid reason to access personal data must be able to do so.

Access must be granted on a need to know basis. It must only be granted for specific

personnel that has to perform a certain task with the personal data and only to specific

set of personal data that needs to be known.

In Baseband Radio Node, the file system is hidden from the user.

For more information about who can operate the feature, users and level of rights, see

MDT feature control in Privacy Implications of the MDT Feature.

## 3.5 Session Duration of the MDT Feature

If the MDT feature has been activated, then UE location data is sent and stored in PM

Event ROP files in the eNodeB. The PM Event ROP files are collected (if file

collection is the chosen option, if not, data is streamed) and analyzed by the Ericsson OSS layer.

Figure 6   Reporting Flow

The requirement to keep the PM Event ROP files is 1 hour, and the storage capacity is

also dimensioned for that. This data is sensitive, and must be deleted according to

retention times. For the MDT collected personal data, the recommendation is 6-12

months.

For more information about session duration of the MDT feature, refer to Location data

retention in Privacy Implications of the MDT Feature.

## 3.6 Use of the MDT Feature Log

The operator can use the MDT log to monitor and detect coverage problem, interference

power, and QoS-related data.

# 4 Network Impact of Minimization of Drive Tests

The Minimization of Drive Tests feature generates RRC signaling between the eNodeB and

the UE.

Capacity and Performance

This feature has a trade-off between report interval and report amount because of battery

consumption. The GPS report interval from UE must be more than five seconds to not drain the

UE battery more than 0.5% per hour, if the report amount is infinite.

Interface

This feature increases the load on the Uu interface both when MDT is activated and

terminated, and when the UE sends measurement reports to the eNodeB. This can be a minor

impact, since RRC signaling has scheduling priority over user data.

The eNodeB receives ManagementBasedMDTAllowed IE through the following

messages:

- INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST and HANDOVER REQUEST message from MME over S1 interface.
- HANDOVER REQUEST message from eNodeB over X2 interface.
- EAB UE CONTEXT FETCH RESPONSE message from Ericsson eNodeB over private X2 interface.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of LTE Minimization of Drive Tests

The activation of this feature requires user consent.

Instead of using traditional drive tests, this feature provides a simple, cheap, and remote

method to use for troubleshooting or verification of the radio network. The feature provides a

tool to optimize network planning with the MDT measurement data, including location

information.

User consent is required before activating the MDT function for a UE because of privacy and

legal obligations. Generally, user consent is collected through a customer care process. The

user consent information availability must be considered part of the subscription data and

provisioned to the HSS database.

- Location Data Granularity UE location is very sensitive data. To reduce the privacy risk, MDT measurements are implemented as described in 3GPP documentation.
- Location Data Retention Location data is collected in PM Event ROP files in the node. This data is sensitive, and must be deleted according to retention times. For the personal data collected by the MDT feature, the recommendation is 6-12 months. The length of time the PM Event ROP files are stored in the node depends on the total file sizes of the saved files. The maximum storage retention of PM Event ROP files on the node is 25 hours. The retention time is reduced as traffic on the node increases and generally retention time is much less than this. Older files are removed whenever new storage capacity is needed for new files.
- MDT Feature Control Only grant access to the specific set of personal data concerned in the task. Access is granted to personnel if the following criteria are met: Have a valid reason to access personal data. Must perform a task with personal data. Is the one performing the task. For a Baseband Radio Node, the file system is hidden from the user.
- Notice to the User Subscribers must be informed or noticed by the UE that UE location tracking is in progress. This threat is mitigated by the consent they gave to the operator. There can be an option, for example, to send the subscribers an SMS that troubleshooting is being performed and that UE location is tracked.
- MDT Feature Use Logging Logging privacy events is very important in creating evidence that can be used as an audit trail. For example, if there is a privacy breach, an audit trail can identify responsibilities and the root cause of the breach.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q3: Minimization of Drive Tests Inter-Frequency Support

Introducing inter-frequency measurements for the Minimization of Drive Tests feature, also enabling the operator to select the measured frequencies, relating to inter-frequency measurements.

| Feature Name:           | Minimization of Drive Tests        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4518 R2                    |
| Value Package Name:     | RAN Data Collection                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0431 R6                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement introduces inter-frequency measurements for the Minimization of Drive Tests

feature. It also enables the operator to select the measured frequencies and choose if a

measurement gap should be used on the UEs that are performing inter-frequency

measurements.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement impacts node performance in the following way:

- Minor impact, RRC signaling has scheduling priority over user data.
- Minor impact, measurement gaps can decrease uplink throughput.
- Minor impact, measurement gaps can decrease downlink throughput.

The enhancement also impacts the Air interface. When Minimization of Drive

Tests is activated, the UE reports one additional measurement report containing

inter-frequency measurement data and location information, which is used by the

feature.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Logged MDT measurements are collected to improve the quality of the Minimization of Drive

Tests function. The Logged MDT function involves measurement logging by the UE in Idle

Mode. The configuration and logs are reported through RRC messaging. They are accessible

on the eNodeB through PM events. The configuration settings for Logged MDT function are

valid for the eNodeB.

Area-based logged reporting collects MDT data from the UEs in a specified area.

Capacity and Performance

- ENM This enhancement requires ENM version 19.2 or later to be used.
- UE UEs need to support Logged MDT measurements function. If the GPS UE positioning data is to be utilized, UEs need to be GNSS-capable.

## Appendix A.c: 19.Q4: M2, M5 and Other Enhancements for Immediate MDT

The

feature enhancement makes it possible to only select GNSS capable UEs for MDT.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The feature enhancement supports Area-based Immediate MDT measurements M2 and M5. M1

includes measurements for SCells when UE is configured for carrier aggregation.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

MdtConfiguration.immediateMdtGnssCheck attribute, which

selects only GNSS capable UEs for MDT with M1, M2, M4, and M5.

The enhancement also introduces MDT PM events for M2 and M5. The PM event for M1 is

extended to include SCell related measurements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

The enhancement requires an ENM version of 19.4 or later to be used.

## Appendix A.d: 20.Q2: M6 and M7 Support for Immediate MDT

The feature enhancement increases the Immediate MDT measurement to enable up to M7 measurements.

| Feature Name:           | Minimization of Drive Tests        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4518                       |
| Value Package Name:     | RAN Data Collection                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0431                       |
| Node Type:              | DU Radio Node  Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Benefits

The feature enhancement increases the range of Immediate MDT measurements. The M6 and M7 measurements make it easier to observe QoS in trace areas.

The enhancement also provides information about the percentage of UEs in a cell which

are capable of UL PDCP Packet Delay measurement.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement slightly increases UE battery consumption, because of the MDT

measurements and more RRC signaling.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following parameters:

- MdtConfiguration.delayThresholdMdtM6
- MdtConfiguration.reportAmountMdtM6
- MdtConfiguration.reportIntervalMdtM6

The feature enhancement also introduces the

pmUeCapabilityUlDelay PM counter.

The feature enhancement introduces the following PM events:

- INTERNAL\_PER\_UE\_MDT\_M6\_DL\_REPORT
- INTERNAL\_PER\_UE\_MDT\_M6\_UL\_REPORT
- INTERNAL\_PER\_UE\_MDT\_M7\_REPORT

Interfaces

RRC messages are updated with Information Elements (IE) for Immediate MDT for M6

uplink reporting.

The following IE is added in the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message

under the ReportConfigEUTRA IE:

- ul-DelayConfig-r13

The following IEs are added in the MeasurementReport message under the

MeasResults IE:

- UL-PDCP-DelayResultList-r13
- UL-PDCP-DelayResult-r13

The following IEs are added in the UECapabilityInformation message

under the UE-EUTRA-Capability IE:

- measParameters-v1310
- ul-PDCP-Delay-r13

Hardware

UE

- UE must support 3GPP Release 13 or later.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.1 or later is required for this feature enhancement.
