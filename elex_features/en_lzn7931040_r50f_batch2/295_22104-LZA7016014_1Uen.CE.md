Summary

The Idle Mode Extended DRX feature introduces hyper SFN. The hyper SFN is the top of

the SFN structure, with which the DRX cycle can be extended.

For LTE UEs, the feature can extend the length of the DRX cycle to a maximum of 43.69

minutes. The feature is especially beneficial for NB-IoT UEs, for which the length

of the DRX cycle can be extended to a maximum of 2.9 hours.

The feature introduces a standardized way to improve the battery life of LTE,

Category M1, and NB-IoT UEs.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations

Network Requirements

The node must have at least one eDRX supported cell or NB-IoT cell.

To benefit from the Idle Mode eDRX feature MME 1.8 or later version is required. The

feature must be activated and the configuration for eDRX must be created in the

MME.

The node must be configured with at least one NTP server, corresponding to at least

one instance of the NtpServer MO. Configuring at least three NTP

servers is recommended.

If the Idle Mode Extended DRX feature is used in a

configuration where multiple nodes are sharing resources, Node Group Synchronization

(NGS) must be used.

A Synchronization Receiver (SR) node is an NGSM node within the node group that is

synchronizing towards one of the node groups internal synchronization references,

which is an SoCC provided by the NGSM node acting as Synchronization Provider (SP).

To run eDRX on the SR node, the following must be fulfilled:

- The SP radio clock state is RNT\_TIME\_LOCKED or RNT\_TIME\_HOLDOVER, or the SP is an LTE node running eDRX.
- There is no DUG SR node between the SP and LTE SR node.

There are no specific node group synchronization restrictions for a running eDRX on

the SP node.

For more information, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.

# 3 Feature Operation of Idle Mode Extended DRX

The Idle Mode eDRX feature allows the UE to listen to paging messages at pre-determined

periods.

The Idle Mode Extended DRX feature covers the following functions:

- Broadcasting SystemInformationBlock1-NB message including eDRX parameters to the UE.
- Broadcasting MasterInformationBlock-NB and SystemInformationBlock1-NB message including Hyper SFN to the NB- IoT UE.
- Transmitting RRC paging message to the UE within the paging time window.

Operational Process

1. The eNodeB broadcasts its eDRX allowance and Hyper SFN to the LTE UE through system information. The eNodeB also broadcasts Hyper SFN to the UE through MIB-NB and SIB1-NB messages to NB-IoT UEs.
2. The UE acquires eDRX cycle and paging time window during attach or tracking area update procedure with the MME.
3. The eNodeB receives eDRX paging information from the MME in the S1AP Paging message .
4. The eNodeB broadcasts paging to the UE in the PF that is within the range of the paging time window. This is accomplished by calculating the following items: Paging Hyperframe (PH) PF PO Starting position within the PH (PTW\_start)

## 3.1 Broadcast System Information to the UE

A new SFN layer, the Hyper SFN is introduced in addition to the legacy SFN

structure.

For LTE, parameters controlling the eDRX are contained in the SIB1 message broadcast in

the cell.

- The EUtranCellFDD.eDrxAllowed and the EUtranCellTDD.eDrxAllowed parameters indicate Idle Mode eDRX support in a cell.
- The HyperSFN is an SFN introduced in addition to the legacy SFN structure. The Hyper SFN is calculated based on the system reference time. With the help of the Hyper SFN, the UE calculates when to monitor the Paging channel according to its calculated paging occasion and paging hyper frame within the hyper frames.

Figure 1   SFN Concept for Idle Mode eDRX

For NB-IoT, hyper-SFN-LSB 2bits is transmitted to the UE through the MIB-NB message, and

SIB1-NB message includes hyperSFN-MSB 8bits.

## 3.2 Reception of S1AP Paging from the MME

If the eNodeB receives an S1AP paging message that includes eDRX information, it is

considered as eDRX Paging.

A hashed UE ID is extracted from the S-TMSI of the UE through a CRC-32 algorithm.

Following the existing Paging Overload Protection mechanism, the incoming paging traffic

intensity is monitored by NbIoTCell.pmPagS1EdrxReceived counter,

which is a subset of NbIoTCell.pmPagS1Received. If there is a

paging overload, the eDRX paging messages are discarded and the

NbIoTCell.pmPagS1EdrxDiscarded counter is stepped, which is a

subset of NbIoTCell.pmPagS1Discarded.

## 3.3 Transmission of RRC Paging to the UE

Each eNodeB that receives the S1AP paging message sends an RRC paging message. The

RRC paging message is sent to the cells that belong to the Tracking Area stated in the S1AP

paging message.

The RRC paging message is transmitted in the Paging Hyperframe (PH), the PF, and the PO

of that specific UE.

3GPP TS 36.304 describes the formula used to calculate the following

items:

- PH
- PF
- PO
- Starting position within the PH (PTW\_start)
- Ending position within the PH (PTW\_end)

The formula uses hashed UE ID to determine the PH, the PTW\_start, and the PTW\_end. The

IMSI of the UE is used in the calculation to determine the PF and PO. When this formula

is used, the paging opportunities for UE in the network are spread in time within the

range of Paging Time Window.

## 3.4 Separated Activation for Category M and LTE

The feature enables the customer to activate the eDRX separately for LTE and Category

M1 UEs.

The EUtranCellFDD.eDrxUeType attribute is used to distinguish

supported UE type for the Idle Mode eDRX when the feature is activated for each cell.

The default value of EUtranCellFDD.eDrxUeType is

LTE\_CATM which means that the eDRX is activated for both LTE and

Category M1 UEs.

Table 2 shows the possible

EUtranCellFDD.eDrxAllowed and

EUtranCellFDD.eDrxUeType configuration combinations.

| TRUE                        | CATM                                                       | DEACTIVATED              | ACTIVE                          |
| FALSE                       | LTE_CATM, LTE, or                                     CATM | DEACTIVATED              | DEACTIVATED                     |

## 3.5 Time and Phase Synchronization for Idle Mode Extended DRX

When Extended DRX is activated, loose time synchronization is applied for optimal

operation, to secure that the Hyper System Frame Number (SFN) is aligned between the

nodes in the RAN.

In case the Baseband is only frequency-locked to an external frequency reference when

Idle Mode Extended DRX is activated, a Basic Frame Number (BFN)  jump takes place, as

the Baseband has to align its clock to the loose time synchronization mechanism. The

triggered BFN jump affects all cells on the Baseband.

External time reference provides more accurate time alignment than loose time

synchronization. In case the Baseband is time-locked to an external time reference (GNSS

or PTO time) when Idle Mode Extended DRX is activated, no BFN jump is performed, as the

jump had already occurred.

For more information, see Manage LTE RAN Synchronization.

# 4 Network Impact of Idle Mode Extended DRX

The feature increases paging cycle for UEs requesting eDRX. Consequently, the amount of

S1AP and RRC paging decreases.

Capacity and Performance

The amount of paging is reduced in case of eDRX.

For UEs requesting eDRX, the paging cycle can be increased. The amount of S1AP paging

decreases with an increasing amount of eDRX UEs. In comparison, the amount of RRC

paging also decreases.

If EUtranCellTDD.eDrxAllowed is set to FALSE

while the Idle Mode eDRX feature for LTE or Category M is activated, the eNodeB

treats S1 eDRX paging as DRX paging. As a result, the

NbIotCell.pmPagReceived counter is increased instead of the

NbIotCell.pmPagEdrxReceived counter.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Idle Mode Extended DRX

The feature introduces MOM attributes for configuration and implementation that affects

a synchronization parameter.

settings and paging. Added configuration steps are required for using the feature with LTE

and Category-M.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012079 MO instance.
2. Set the ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationEdrx attribute to the default value, 10 (= 1 second). The recommended value is the default value that can be configured to a specific value if necessary.
3. Set the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSeconds attribute.
4. Set the TimeSettings.gpsToUtcLeapSecondsChangeDate attribute to a correct value. If the date of the next leap second change is not known, leave the value empty. Once it is published, the attribute has to be updated.

For NB-IoT, do the following:

5. Set the Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrxNb attribute to a recommended or specific value. Result: The eDRX is activated for NB-IoT.

For LTE and Category M, do the following:

6. Set the Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx attribute to a recommended or specific value.
7. Lock the EUtranCellFDD MO or EUtranCellTDD MO instance for the cell where the feature is activated.
8. Set the EUtranCellFDD.eDrxAllowed or EUtranCellTDD.eDrxAllowed attribute to TRUE.
9. Set the EUtranCellFDD.eDrxUeType attribute to either of the following, depending on the chosen supported UE type: LTE\_CATM LTE CATM
10. Unlock the chosen MO instance.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q3: Idle Mode Extended DRX Enhancements

This feature enhancement

implements

idle mode eDRX for

NB-IoT and introduces

support

for loose

HSFN.

| Feature Name:           | Idle Mode Extended DRX             |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4655                       |
| Value Package Name:     | M-IoT RAN on LTE Base Package      |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 1000                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE, MI                            |

Benefits

The enhancement introduces loose, NTP-based time synchronization for eDRX.  It makes possible

to use eDRX in networks without tight time synchronization.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The following attributes are introduced:

- ENodeBFunction.timePhaseMaxDeviationEdrx
- ENodeBFunction.timePhaseSyncStateEdrx
- Paging.defaultPagingCycleNbIot
- Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrxNb

Table 6   Introduced and Deprecated Attributes

| Introduced Attribute           | Deprecated Attribute          |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Paging.pagingDiscardTimerDrx   | Paging.pagingDiscardTimer     |
| Paging.pagingDiscardTimerEdrx  | ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary53 |
| Paging.pagingDiscardTimerDrxNb | Paging.pagingDiscardTimerNb   |

The following attribute is updated:

- Paging.defaultPagingCycle

The following PM counters are updated:

- ENodeBFunction.pmPagS1Received
- ENodeBFunction.pmPagS1Discarded
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPagReceived
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPagReceived
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPagDiscarded
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPagDiscarded
- NbIotCell.pmPagReceivedCe
- NbIotCell.pmPagDiscardedCe

If EUtranCellFDD.eDrxAllowed or

EUtranCellTDD.eDrxAllowed is set to false

while the Idle Mode Extended DRX feature is activated, the eNodeB treats S1 eDRX

paging as DRX paging. As a result, the pmPagReceived counter is

increased instead of the pmPagEdrxReceived counter. If the paging

message is discarded, the pmPagDiscarded counter is increased

instead of the pmPagEdrxDiscarded counter.

Interfaces

This change affects the following interfaces:

- RRC Protocol, 3GPP TS 36.331 SIB1 updated indicating if idle mode eDRX is allowed in the cell and indication of HSFN for LTE.
- S1AP, 3GPP TS 36.413 Addition of Paging eDRX Information IE and NB-IoT Paging eDRX Information IE to the S1AP paging message, containing eDRX cycle value and Paging Time Window for the UE to be paged.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 17A or later is required.

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q1: Separated Activation of Idle Mode Extended DRX for Cat-M1 and LTE

This feature enhancement enables the customer to activate support for Idle Mode eDRX

for each UE type.
