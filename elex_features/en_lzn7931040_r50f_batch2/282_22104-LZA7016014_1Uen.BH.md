Summary

The algorithm calculates Transmit Power Control commands based on the received uplink

SINR and the configured SINR target.

Two kinds of PUSCH closed-loop power control algorithms exist, P0-based and

SINR-based. This feature introduces the switching between them, in accordance with

cell interference levels and cell uplink power load. This feature can also mitigate

the influence of high external uplink LTE interference by increasing the UE uplink

TX power.

SINR-based closed-loop power control is introduced to control UE PUSCH transmission

power. The operator can configure measurement thresholds for switching between P0-

and SINR-based power control, in accordance with actual network conditions.

With P0-based closed-loop power control, PUSCH transmission power is adjusted to

achieve the expected uplink PSD target by transmit power control command. Uplink

interference is not considered for UE power adjustment.

The advantage of SINR-based closed-loop power control is that it takes interference

into account when adjusting the UE PUSCH power. This is especially useful in the

case of wideband and time-variable external uplink interference. In this case, it is

difficult for the operator to set a suitable P0 to fully compensate for

time-variable interference. SINR-based closed-loop power control can provide

reasonable SINR for PUSCH reception unless the UE uplink transmission power reaches

its maximum.

This licensed feature supports both TDD and FDD. It can be turned on or off at cell level.

# 3 Feature Operation of Differential Uplink Power Control

The feature introduces a SINR-based PUSCH closed-loop power control

algorithm.

The feature introduces the possibility to switch between the following PUSCH closed-loop

power control algorithms:

- SINR-based
- P0-based

The operator can configure measurement thresholds for switching between the P0-based and the

SINR-based power control algorithms with the EUtranCellFDD.ulTxPsdDistrThr

or the EUtranCellTDD.ulTxPsdDistrThr MO attributes. This configuration

depends on the current network conditions.

The P0-based and SINR-based closed-loop power control algorithms support power control

optimization at initial access. During this procedure, UE PUSCH transmission power is

increased if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- There is high interference in cell.
- The estimated Msg3 SINR value is smaller than the demodulation value.

SINR-Based Closed-Loop Power Control

The SINR-based power control algorithm calculates Transmit Power Control commands based on

the received uplink SINR and the configured SINR target, with the

EUtranCellFDD.rxSinrTargetClpc or the

EUtranCellTDD.rxSinrTargetClpc attribute.

P0-Based Closed-Loop Power Control

When P0-based power control is selected, the strength of the transmission power is adjusted

in the following way:

- UE PUSCH transmission power is increased for users with poor channel quality.
- UE PUSCH transmission power is decreased for users with optimal channel quality.

The strength of the transmission power can be further adjusted with the flexible

differential power control optimization function. The function can be enabled with the

EUtranCellFDD.enableSinrUplinkClpc or the

EUtranCellTDD.enableSinrUplinkClpc attribute.

Flexible differential power control optimization enables the separate configuration of UEs

under optimal channel conditions and under poor channel conditions. For optimal channel

conditions, power control optimization can be enabled with the

EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodEnabled attribute. For poor channel

conditions, power control optimization can be enabled with the

EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExBadEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExBadEnabled attribute. Power control optimization

for optimal channel conditions and for poor channel conditions can be enabled separately or

at the same time.

The operator can control a SINR threshold identifying UEs in optimal channel conditions

with the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr
- EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr

The operator can control a SINR threshold identifying UEs in poor channel conditions with

the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExBadSinrThr
- EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExBadSinrThr

Flexible differential power control optimization affects the strength of transmission power

in the following way:

- UE PUSCH transmission power is increased if the following conditions are true: Power control optimization for poor channel conditions is enabled. The eNodeB estimates that the received SINR value is smaller than the SINR threshold for identifying UEs in poor channel conditions. There are no limitations on UE transmission power.
- UE PUSCH transmission power is reduced if the following conditions are true: Power control optimization for optimal channel conditions is enabled. The eNodeB estimates that the received SINR value is larger than the SINR threshold for identifying UEs in optimal channel conditions.

When using default configuration values, flexible differential power control optimization

might cause the peak UE throughput to degrade on the uplink. If the peak UE throughput is

allowed to be reduced, UE transmission power can be further reduced also. The function can

be configured to either maintain UE throughput or maximize UE power reduction with the

following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr
- EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr
- EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset64Qam
- EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset64Qam
- EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset256Qam
- EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset256Qam

# 4 Network Impact of Differential Uplink Power Control

The feature mitigates the influence of high external LTE interference by increasing UE

uplink TX power.

Capacity and Performance

When the Differential Uplink Power Control feature is activated, UEs can more easily reach

the maximum TX power level when the cell suffers high time-variable interference. This

occurs in external uplink wideband interference. The uplink cell throughput can be improved

in the case of high external uplink interference, and also when the interference is from

neighbor cells.

There can be a trade-off in situations where there is a high percentage of power-limited

UEs in the cell. These UEs can experience degraded SINR because they are unable to increase

TX power to overcome the increased intra-frequency interference level caused by the feature.

This can result in increased E-RAB setup failure and bearer drops. It is recommended to turn

off the Differential Uplink Power Control feature if the average number of power-limited UEs

in the network is over 50%.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012089 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Differential Uplink Power Control

Threshold recommendations for the feature are affected by the SINR-based closed-loop

power control algorithm.

Threshold for Measured Noise Plus Interference Level

The value of EUtranCellFDD.interferenceThresholdSinrClpc must be

larger than EUtranCellFDD.pZeroNominalPusch -

EUtranCellFDD.rxSinrTargetClpc + 10 × log(Rx antenna number)

+ SINR-based closed-loop power control switching offset.

In other cases the EUtranCellFDD.interferenceThresholdSinrClpc is

replaced by the latter value.

The same applies for

EUtranCellTDD.interferenceThresholdSinrClpc.

Recommended Values for EUtranCellFDD.ulTxPsdDistrThr and

EUtranCellTDD.ulTxPsdDistrThr

Table 4   Recommended Values

| Parameter                     |   Recommended Value |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| EUtranCellFDD.ulTxPsdDistrThr |                  20 |
| EUtranCellTDD.ulTxPsdDistrThr |                  40 |

Flexible Differential Power Control Optimization

Flexible differential power control optimization can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.enableSinrUplinkClpc or the

EUtranCellTDD.enableSinrUplinkClpc attribute to

true.

Power control optimization for optimal channel conditions can be enabled by setting

the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodEnabled attribute to

true.

Power control optimization for poor channel conditions can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExBadEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExBadEnabled attribute to

true.

If power control optimization is enabled both for optimal channel conditions and for

poor channel conditions, the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr attribute must be larger

than the value of the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExBadSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExBadSinrThr attribute.

Reducing the value of the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr attribute to be smaller

than the demodulation SINR required for peak UE throughput causes UE throughput to

be reduced. Neighboring cells can benefit from this configuration, as the reduced UE

throughput causes interference and UE transmission power to be reduced also.

However, if the value of the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr or

the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr attribute is smaller than

the SINR required for maintaining the call, the UE might drop the call.

Increasing the value of the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr or

the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr attribute can lessen the

benefit of decreased interference to neighboring cells, unless power control

optimization for optimal channel conditions is disabled.

## 9.1 Maximize UE Power Reduction during Flexible Differential Power Control Optimization

The reduction of UE transmission power can be maximized if power control optimization

for optimal channel conditions is configured to allow the peak UE throughput to be

reduced.

Prerequisites

Power control optimization is enabled for optimal channel conditions.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr or the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr attribute to the desired value.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset64Qam or the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset64Qam attribute to 0.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset256Qam or the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset256Qam attribute to 0.

## 9.2 Maintain UE Throughput during Flexible Differential Power Control Optimization

The peak UE throughput can be protected during power control optimization for optimal

channel conditions with the threshold for optimal channel conditions and its

offsets.

Prerequisites

Power control optimization is enabled for optimal channel conditions.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr or the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrThr attribute to the desired value.
2. Set the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset64Qam or the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset64Qam attribute to 3.
3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset256Qam or the EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodSinrOffset256Qam attribute to 10, or higher.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q3: Differential Uplink Power Control Optimization

The enhancement improves differential uplink power control during initial access and

when P0-based closed-loop power control is selected.

| Feature Name:           | Differential Uplink Power Control   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4680                        |

| Access Type:            | LTE                                 |

During the initial access procedure, the enhancement increases UE PUSCH transmission

power if either of the following conditions apply:

- There is high interference in the cell.
- The estimated Msg3 SINR value is smaller than the demodulation value.

When P0-based power control is selected, the strength of the transmission power is

further adjusted in the following ways:

- UE PUSCH transmission power is increased for users with poor channel quality. Because of this, interference to intra-frequency neighbor cells increases.
- UE PUSCH transmission power is decreased for users with optimal channel quality. Because of this, interference to intra-frequency neighbor cells decreases.

Benefits

The enhancement improves accessibility and retainability.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement improves the RRC Connection Setup success rate. This improvement can

be observed with the help of the following PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSucc
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSucc
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAtt
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAtt

The interference impact of the enhancement can be observed on the neighboring cell

- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb1-EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb100
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb1-EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwrPrb100

## Appendix A.c: 22.Q2: Flexible Differential Power Control Optimization

This feature enhancement improves the performance of the P0-based closed-loop power

control algorithm by introducing parameters to control the strength of UE PUSCH transmission

power.

| Feature Name           | Differential Uplink Power Control   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4680                        |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                    |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400                        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type            | LTE                                 |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces parameters to enable or disable power control

optimization for optimal and for poor channel conditions. Configurable SINR

thresholds are introduced to allow the operator to define which UEs are in optimal

channel conditions and in poor channel conditions.

This feature enhancement is supported during the P0-based closed-loop power control

algorithm only.

The main benefit of this feature enhancement is the improved flexibility of

differential uplink power control optimization under optimal and poor channel

conditions.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved flexibility of differential uplink power control optimization under optimal and poor channel conditions
- Reduced uplink interference to neighboring cells under optimal channel conditions
- Improved SINR of UEs with no power limitations under poor channel conditions

Capacity and Performance

Under optimal channel conditions, the introduced SINR threshold can cause UE PUSCH

transmission power to be reduced. Decreasing the value of the introduced SINR

threshold reduces uplink interference to neighboring cells. However, this change can

reduce uplink cell and UE throughput also. Keeping the SINR threshold equal to or

larger than the minimum SINR that can reach UE peak throughput ensures that the

uplink throughput of the current cell is protected. Under optimal channel

conditions, this feature enhancement does not benefit cells with no interference to

neighboring cells.

Under poor channel conditions, the introduced SINR threshold can cause UE PUSCH

transmission power to be increased. As a result, the SINR of UEs with no power

limitations can be improved, which might cause UE throughput and retainability to be

improved also. This feature enhancement can increase coverage under poor channel

conditions by helping more UEs connect to the cell. As a result, uplink throughput

is increased during light traffic conditions and decreased during heavy traffic.

The benefits of this feature enhancement can be observed with the following PM

counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioRecInterferencePwr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmSinrPuschDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmSinrPuschDistr

Operation

This feature enhancement affects the strength of UE PUSCH transmission power in the

following way:

- UE PUSCH transmission power is reduced if the following conditions are true: Power control optimization under optimal channel conditions is enabled. The eNodeB estimates that the received SINR value is larger than the SINR threshold for identifying UEs in optimal channel conditions.
- UE PUSCH transmission power is increased if the following conditions are true: Power control optimization under poor channel conditions is enabled. The eNodeB estimates that the received SINR value is smaller than the SINR threshold for identifying UEs in poor channel conditions. There are no limitations on UE transmission power.

This feature enhancement can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.enableSinrUplinkClpc or the

EUtranCellTDD.enableSinrUplinkClpc attribute to

true.

Power control optimization for poor channel conditions can be enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExBadEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExBadEnabled attribute to

true.

Power control optimization for optimal channel conditions can be enabled by setting

the EUtranCellFDD.p0ClpcExGoodEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.p0ClpcExGoodEnabled attribute to

true.
