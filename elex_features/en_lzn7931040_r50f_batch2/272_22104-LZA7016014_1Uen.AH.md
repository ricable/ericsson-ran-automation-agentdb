# 1 Overlaid Cell Detection Overview

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature

optimizes

the detection of small cells for load balancing in the eNodeB

for

offload. The feature also improves offload by using automatic and dynamic

identification.

Summary

The

identification

of small cells for load balancing or offload is done based on hit rates.

Cells with different sizes are expected to be deployed in heterogeneous networks.When load

balancing and offload is used, the Overlaid Cell Detection feature improves the

efficiency of small cells with high capacity. Small cells are expected to be seen

with low hit rate from the surrounding large cells. If small cells

have

a lower hit rate than the specified threshold in the Best

Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management feature, they cannot be

automatically added as load relations.

Additional Information

# 2 Dependencies of Overlaid Cell Detection

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature depends on multiple Load Management features that

handle handovers or load balancing.

# 3 Feature Operation of Overlaid Cell Detection

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature initiates cells within a target eNodeB to increase

efficiency.

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature operates within or between eNodeBs. In case the

source cell and the target cell are in the same eNodeB, communication is done by

internal signaling. Between eNodeBs, X2 messaging is used for checking feature

activation and small cell detection.

The definition illustrated in Figure 1

is not limited to small target cells and it can also include large cells depending on

the deployment and configurations. This means that large cells on other frequencies can

also have high hit rate in the other direction.

Figure 1   Low Hit Rate Target Cell with High Hit Rate in the Other Direction

Figure 2 shows that the Overlaid Cell

Detection feature can limit its functions to only small cells.

Figure 2   High Hit Rate Target in the Other Direction can be a Small Cell or a Large

Cell

Operational Process

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature introduces the X2 EAB OVERLAID CELL

INDICATION message, see Figure 3.

Figure 3   High Hit Rate Indication over X2

The Overlaid Cell Detection feature also supports macro cells, but it can limit its

functions to small cells only.

## 3.1 Feature Activation over X2

A macro eNodeB is required for the EAB eNodeB Feature List IE to be added in

the following X2 messages:

- X2 Setup Request
- X2 Setup Response
- X2 eNB Configuration Update

The information from the message indicates if the Overlaid Cell Detection feature is

activated, or not.

## 3.2 Identification of High Hit Rate Neighbors

To identify overlaid neighbors as small cells, their transmission power is used as criteria.

If the maximum value of the NodeBSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

parameter for all sectors in a cell is less than or equal to the threshold value specified by

the LoadBalancingFunction.txPwrForOverlaidCellDetect parameter, the cell is

assumed as a small cell. The default value for the

LoadBalancingFunction.txPwrForOverlaidCellDetect parameter corresponds

with 5W transmission power. This means that overlaid neighbor cells can include both pico

cells and macro cells.

After the hit rate of each neighbor cell is calculated by the Best Neighbor Relations for

Intra-LTE Load Management feature, the cell relations on each frequency relation are listed

based on their hit rates. The hit rate lists are updated every load balancing cycle according

to the A5 measurement.

The best cell relations are indicated by setting the

EUtranCellRelation.incomingLoadBalancing parameter to

true for the following neighbor cells on a certain frequency:

- Cells with hit rate value higher than or equal to LoadBalancingFunction.ocdMinHighHitThresh.
- Cells up to maximum number LoadBalancingFunction.ocdMaxNoHighHitRateCells for each frequency relation.

## 3.3 High Hit Rate Indication over X2

When the EUtranCellRelation.incomingLoadBalancing parameter is updated,

the cell relation is either qualified or disqualified as a relatively high hit rate. The

source eNodeB receives the X2 EAB OVERLAID CELL INDICATION message. The

message includes a list of the cells in the target eNodeB with identified high coverage

overlap towards the specified cells in the source eNodeB.

The X2 EAB OVERLAID CELL INDICATION message is also sent in connection with

the following messages:

- X2 Setup Request
- X2 Setup Response
- X2 eNB Configuration Update

After the X2 setup procedure between the source and the target eNodeB, both nodes trigger the

X2 EAB OVERLAID CELL INDICATION message to update the target eNodeB with the

current status of the identified overlaid cells. If the X2 eNB Configuration

Update message indicates an addition of a new cell relation, the target node

triggers the X2 EAB OVERLAID CELL INDICATION message. This message informs

the target node that the added cell relation is identified as an overlaid cell.

## 3.4 Reception of High Hit Rate Indication

At reception of the X2 EAB OVERLAID CELL INDICATION message, the

EUtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated parameter is updated for the

corresponding cell relation. This means that for every load balancing cycle, the configuration

of load relations including small cells are automatically configured in the source eNodeB.

When the X2 eNB Configuration Update message is received in the source

eNodeB, it indicates removal of a cell relation in the target eNodeB. The corresponding

EUtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated parameter must be reset to

false.

# 4 Network Impact of Overlaid Cell Detection
