# 1 Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point Overview

The Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point feature provides higher data throughput for UEs

at cell edge which experience interference.

| Feature Name           | Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point                                           |

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4223                                                               |
| Value Package Name     | CoMP                                                                       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0442                                                               |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                        |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                                        |
| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point feature allows for the efficient use of network

resources and achieves improved user experience for UEs that experience

interference. The benefit of the feature is achieved by transmitting data at a

higher bit rate to UEs that experience interference by coordinating the serving and

interfering cells.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Increased downlink throughput for users at cell edge in a radio environment with high inter-cell intra-frequency interference.
- Improved throughput at cell edge in a heterogeneous network, macro deployment, and indoor deployment, where the overlap between the cells is large.

In mixed mode configurations, intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module cells can be

considered as external interfering cells for the Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point

feature. The feature is also supported for eNodeBs configured with two LTE capacity

modules.

Additional Information

For more information on this feature and related topics, see 3GPP TS 36.331,

Event A5.

# 2 Dependencies of Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point

The Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point feature conflicts with the Carrier Aggregation

feature. Limitations related to the number of UEs to be coordinated also apply.

Hardware

This feature is not supported on AIR 6454 units.

Limitations

The number of UEs to be coordinated is limited if there is a high load on the main

processor, due to rejected A5 measurement.

Network Requirements

No network requirement for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point

The Downlink Coordination Multi-Point feature improves cell edge throughput in scenarios

with large cell overlap for a heterogeneous network, macro deployment, and indoor

deployment.

The feature uses downlink transmission information from serving and interfering cells to

coordinate and improve the downlink link adaptation.

Operational Process

1. UEs that have poor SINR are identified based on CQI.
2. A5 measurement is configured for the identified UEs. For more information about A5 measurement, see Manage Mobility LTE.
3. The Baseband coordination step identifies potential interference from other cells and opportunities for coordinated link adaptation in each TTI.
4. Information from the coordination is passed to scheduling and link adaptation.
