Summary

The Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature enhances mobility by introducing uplink channel quality. It is measured in the eNodeB as SINR. It is an addition to the quantities measured on the downlink channel. This improves the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature and the functionality of the following features to increase mobility handling flexibility at poor uplink channel coverage:

- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover
- Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Handover
- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Handover

The feature also introduces an uplink search zone along the edge of

the cell, where UE measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells. If a

frequency or cell is detected, a mobility action is initiated.

The feature enables UEs with poor uplink coverage to search for inter-frequency

target frequencies. The UE can move to another frequency with inter-frequency

handover, or to another RAT with IRAT handover.

In case of inter-frequency handover to E-UTRAN cells, the uplink quality of the target cell is

evaluated to avoid handover to a cell with worse or insufficient uplink quality.

This evaluation is also performed for downlink-triggered handovers.

The feature moves UEs in critical uplink coverage to other E-UTRAN or IRAT cells with handover

or release and redirection.

When this feature is activated together with the Automated Neighbor Relations

feature, inter-frequency neighbors can be added in the uplink search zone based on

mobility triggers instead of triggering on the dedicated ANR measurements that are

used in the rest of the cell.

The feature also enables Automated Neighbor Relations to add inter-frequency

neighbors based on mobility triggers in the uplink search zone, instead of

triggering on the dedicated ANR measurements used in the rest of the cell. This

provides the following benefits:

- ANR can define neighbor cells in such a way that the best cell is identified and used.
- The ANR-initiated measurements are removed in the uplink search zone and replaced with measurements intended for mobility. This means that only the cells used for mobility purposes are added. This reduces the neighbor list to only include cells that are used.

Features

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

To configure redirection of the UE at poor uplink coverage, information about other

carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during network configuration

according to the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

This feature introduces an uplink search zone along the edge of the cell where UE

measurements search for alternative frequencies and cells.

When the UE detects a frequency or cell, a mobility action is initiated. The triggering

quantity for transition between the coverage zones is the uplink SINR based on DMRS

power, power headroom, and noise and interference transmitted by the UE.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

This feature enables the eNodeB to determine where to transfer a UE that is in poor

coverage. This process is enhanced by the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

feature.

Figure 1   UE Transfer at Poor Coverage Using an Uplink Search Zone

Process Steps

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB starts monitoring uplink coverage to detect when the serving cell drops below the threshold for entering the uplink search zone or uplink critical zone.
3. The A2 measurement is triggered in the eNodeB indicating that the UE enters the uplink search zone for this triggering quantity. Note: ANR-triggered PCI measurements for LTE, GERAN, or UTRAN frequencies are configured when the UE attaches to the cell. These measurements are not affected by the UE entering the uplink search zone.
4. If the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer attribute is set to a value different than the default 0, the timer is started or restarted.
5. The eNodeB stops the A2 measurement that triggers when the UE enters the uplink search zone. The eNodeB starts the measurements that must be active in the uplink search zone. The following measurements must be active:
    - The A1 measurement is used to detect if the UE moves into a good uplink coverage zone.
    - The Target Good Enough measurements are used to detect the candidate frequencies. For LTE frequencies, A5 measurement is used. For GERAN and UTRAN frequencies, B2 measurement is used. A frequency can be measured if both the UE and the node support measurements on the frequency.Note: The value of the following attributes must be set to true: UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF for LTE frequencies UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN for GERAN frequencies UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN for UTRAN frequencies A frequency can be measured if both the UE and the node support measurements on the frequency. The UE supports measurements on the frequency. The node supports measurements on the frequency.Note: The value of the following attributes must be set to true: UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF for LTE frequencies UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN for GERAN frequencies UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN for UTRAN frequencies The priority of the frequency states can be measured. A priority value of -1 means that the frequency is not measured. If the UE has an active voice bearer with a QCI value of 1, the attribute voicePrio is used to determine the priority. In this case, frequency relation MOs that do not have this attribute are not measured. If the UE does not have an active voice bearer with a QCI value of 1, the connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute is used. If more frequencies can be measured than those that are configured in the UE, some of the frequencies with the lowest priority are omitted according to the voicePrio or the connectedModeMobilityPrio priority attributes. This depends on whether the UE has an active voice bearer with a QCI value of 1. A5 measurements can be configured using attributes in the ReportConfigA5UlTrig MO. B2 measurements can be configured using parameters in the ReportConfigB2GeranUlTrig and the ReportConfigB2UtraUlTrig MOs. It is recommended to set the threshold of the a5Threshold1Rsrp attribute to the maximum value of -44. Using this value ensures that uplink-triggered inter-frequency handovers can occur throughout the entire cell area. In the case of B2 measurement, b2Threshold1Rsrp is set to the maximum value by internal parameters. If the Automated Neighbor Relations feature is active, it uses the A5 measurement and B2 measurement reports to detect unknown cells. For more information, see Step 12.
6. If a bearer with a QCI value of 1 is set up while the UE is in the uplink search zone:
    - The UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is restarted.
    - All A5 measurements and B2 measurements are removed from the UE and replaced with new measurements for frequencies based on the voicePrio attribute. These measurements are configured in the same way as for a UE that enters the uplink search zone with a bearer with a QCI value of 1. For more information, see Step 5.
7. If a bearer with a QCI value of 1 is released while the UE is in the uplink search zone:
    - All A5 and B2 measurements are removed from the UE and replaced by measurements for frequencies based on the connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute. These measurements are configured as if the UE entered the uplink search zone without any bearer with a QCI value of 1 already set up. For more information, see step 5.
    - The UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is restarted if the frequencies that are defined in the voicePrio attribute differ from the frequencies that are defined in the connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute.
8. When a UE leaves the uplink search zone and enters good uplink coverage, an A1 measurement is reported in the eNodeB. The eNodeB then monitors A2 measurement instead of A1 measurement. The A5 and B2 measurement are removed from the UE. The UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer is canceled and the eNodeB waits for A2 measurement UL Search or A2 measurement Uplink Critical Coverage. Then, Automated Neighbor Relations can configure PCI measurements in the UE again.
9. The UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer expires. If the UE does not have an active bearer with a QCI value of 1, which indicates a voice bearer, the eNodeB stops all A5 measurement and B2 measurement Target Good Enough measurements. If the UE has an active bearer with a QCI value of 1, the eNodeB restarts the timer, but does not stop the measurements.
10. A Target Good Enough measurement report arrives from the UE for one of the frequencies.
11. The eNodeB informs the Automated Neighbor Relations feature about the best cell of the measurement report if the cell is unknown in the source cell. This is applicable even if there are other known cells in the same measurement report. This enables the Automated Neighbor Relations feature to request the UE to report the unique CGI of the potential neighbor cell. This report is sent before the next A5 measurement report or B2 measurement report arrives from the UE. This occurs if the following requirements are fulfilled:
    - The Automated Neighbor Relations feature is activated for the specific RAT of the measurement report.
    - The best cell of the measurement report is unknown in the source cell, that is, there is no cell relation to the reported cell from the source cell.
    - No voice call is ongoing in the UE, that is, the UE has no bearer with a QCI value of 1.
    - The UE is able to do CGI measurements for the reported cell.
    - No earlier A5 measurement report or B2 measurement report with best cell unknown is received. That is, for a UE, the maximum of one measurement report is ignored to allow for an Automated Neighbor Relations CGI measurement while the UE is in the search zone.
12. The eNodeB checks if a handover is allowed and possible to one of the reported cells, starting with the strongest one. A cell is not a viable handover target in any of the following cases: If the UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheck attribute is set to true, the eNodeB uses an extended check of A5 measurements before handover based on the following conditions:
    - The cell is not defined in the MOM.
    - There is no cell relation to the cell from the serving cell in the MOM.
    - The value of the isHoAllowed attribute is set to false on the cell relation MO.
    - The uplink quality of the target cell cannot be evaluated and this is not overridden by the ExternalENodeBFunction.ulTrigHoSupport attribute. This applies only when an A5 measurement is reported for the target cell. Note: If an B2 measurement was reported for the target cell, the IRAT handover is performed without uplink evaluation.
    - The cell has a tracking area or location area which is forbidden according to the HRL of the UE.
    - RSRP measured value must be higher than either of the following calculated expressions: The term is included only if the feature Service Triggered Mobility is operable and the feature Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility is not activated. The cellIndivOffset\_C attribute applies to Data CIO or QCI1 CIO, depending on the configured QCI1 bearer and whether the EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled attribute is set to true. The sum is included only if the feature Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility is operable. The cellIndivOffset\_C attribute applies to Data CIO or QCI1 CIO, depending on the configured QCI1 bearer and whether EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is activated.

    - RSRQ measured value must be higher than the following calculated expression: The cellIndivOffset\_C parameter applies to Data CIO or QCI1 CIO, depending on the configured QCI1 bearer and whether the EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled attribute is set to true.

18. If a cell is selected, the handover is initiated. In case of IRAT handover, uplink evaluation is not performed. Note: If the selected cell is a WCDMA cell, oscillating IRAT handover can occur. To avoid this, uplink quality thresholds must be tuned down or B2 thresholds must be tuned up. This affects all UEs in the cell. If the target cell supports the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature, uplink channel evaluation in the target cell is performed for X2 handovers. The evaluation takes place when the target cell receives the handover request message. The following requirements must be fulfilled for the handover to be performed: If the handover is accepted, the Handover Request Acknowledge X2 message is sent to the source eNodeB. If the handover is rejected, the Handover Preparation Failure X2 message is sent to the source eNodeB with applicable cause value. If the UE arrives to uplink search state in the target cell, the target eNodeB rejects the incoming handover with the targetUlBelowThreshold cause. If the uplink quality is not an offset better in the target than in the source cell, the target eNodeB rejects the incoming handover with the ulImprovementBelowThreshold cause. In case none of the reported cells are viable for handover, the eNodeB takes no further action. This means that the UE remains in the cell and waits for another A5 or B2 measurement report or an A1 measurement. For more information, see Manage Radio Network and Manage Mobility.
    - The UE must not arrive to UL search state in the target cell: The UeMeasControl.targetA2UlSearchOffset attribute is configured on the target side.
    ![Image](../images/214_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.BY/additional_3_CP.png)
    - The UL quality must be an offset better in the target than in the source cell: The UeMeasControl.ulSinrOffset attribute is configured on the source side. SINRmaxRSRP is based on UE reported RSRP and measured noise+interference (N+I) on the uplink carrier.Note: If the High Power UE feature is used, the time normalized filtered SINR calculation for DMRS and the SINR calculation in uplink evaluation that is based on the RSRP of the source cell consider the following: Carrier Aggregation configuration UE power class

21. An A2 measurement is reported in the node.
22. A prioritized list of possible target frequencies is determined for handover if the UE reaches critical coverage.
    1. The node determines a set of LTE inter-frequency or IRAT frequencies where the UE can be transferred when it encounters poor coverage in the current cell. The node finds all applicable frequency relation MO instances for the current cell: EUtranFreqRelation GeranFreqGroupRelation UtranFreqRelation UtranTDDFreqRelation Cdma2000FreqBandRelation A frequency relation MO instance is applicable if the following conditions are met: The corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is active and enabled. Table 2 Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity Features for Redirection Target RAT Feature LTE Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity (FAJ 121 0797) WCDMA Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity (FAJ 121 0493) GERAN Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity (FAJ 121 0495) CDMA2000 Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity (FAJ 121 0491) The UE is able to operate on the frequency band according to UE capabilities. This is reported to the node in the UE-EUTRA-Capability IE. Note: When the Multiple Frequency Band Indicators feature is operable, the UE can support more frequencies. The corresponding RAT is not forbidden according to the HRL of the UE. If the allowedPlmnList attribute of the frequency relation MO is not empty, that is, at least one of the PLMNs in this attribute matches one of the PLMNs in the HRL of the UE.
    2. If the UeMeasControl.excludeInterFreqAtCritical attribute is set to true, all E-UTRAN frequencies are removed from the list.
    3. The used priority is decided. Table 3 Frequency Relation Priority Selection QCI of Active UE Bearer Used Attribute The UE has an active bearer with QCI=1 voicePrioAny frequency relation that does not have a voicePrio attribute is considered to have priority −1. The UE has no active bearer with QCI=1 connectedModeMobilityPrio
    4. The list is ordered according to the selected priority, and each frequency with priority −1 is removed from the list.
    5. If a frequency has been measured in the search zone for longer than the time indicated by the value of the UeMeasControl.searchEffortTime attribute, it is excluded from the list as non-feasible target. If this would leave the list empty, the list is left unmodified. If the value of the UeMeasControl.searchEffortTime attribute is 0, the list is always unmodified by this step.
23. The eNodeB checks if a blind handover is possible to a cell on one the high priority frequencies in the list of possible target frequencies. A cell is a viable blind handover target if the following requirements are fulfilled: If a cell is selected, the handover is initiated without uplink evaluation.
    - The mobilityAction attribute on the relevant frequency relation MO has the value HANDOVER.
    - The relevant handover feature is operable. Table 4 Handover Features for Blind Handover Target RAT Feature LTE Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover (FAJ 121 0877) Intra-LTE Inter-Mode Handover (FAJ 121 3042) Note: This feature is applicable when the frequency has a different mode, TDD or FDD. WCDMA Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover SRVCC Handover to UTRAN GERAN SRVCC Handover to GERAN
    - The UE has support for handover to the relevant RAT.
    - The cell is defined in the MOM.
    - There is a cell relation to the target cell from the serving cell in the MOM.
    - The isHoAllowed attribute is set to true on the cell relation MO.
    - The coverageIndicator attribute is set to COVERS on the cell relation MO.
    - The EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute is set to true on the serving cell.
    - The cell has a tracking area or location area that is not forbidden according to the HRL of the UE.
    - The feature Cell Soft Lock has not temporarily set the cell as a non-viable target.
24. If the UE has an active bearer with a QCI value of 1, which indicates a voice bearer, UE release is not allowed. The node takes no further action and the UE remains in the cell and waits for one of the following measurement reports: Target Good Enough Good Coverage Critical Coverage Search Zone This behavior can be changed by setting the allowReleaseQci1 attribute to true. Note: Setting the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute takes effect only if SRVCC Handover to UTRAN or SRVCC Handover to GERAN is not operable. If the eNodeB performs a release with redirect, the default behavior in a Core Network is to remove the voice connection. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI=1, the node initiates a release with redirect to the frequency with the highest priority in the list of possible target frequencies.

## 3.1 Measurement Configuration

The uplink search zone follows the edge of the cell and is detected by A2

measurements.

Figure 2 shows the uplink search

zone.

Figure 2   Cell Uplink Search Zone Defined by Uplink Search Thresholds

The Search Threshold

To detect that the UE has entered the uplink search zone, A2 measurements are started

in the eNodeB when it attaches to the cell. When an A2 measurement triggers, the UE

is considered to be in the uplink search zone. To detect when the UE leaves the

uplink search zone and enters into good uplink coverage again, corresponding A1

measurements are started in the eNodeB.

The report configuration for both the A2 measurement and the A1 measurement is based

on parameters in the ReportConfigSearch MO.

The report configurations for these events are also affected by the Service Triggered

Mobility and the Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility features.

It is not recommended to set the search threshold of the

a1a2UlSearchThreshold attribute higher than 320. This causes

UEs to trigger A2 measurement and move to the uplink search zone after attaching to

the cell. Once the UEs are in the uplink search zone, the UEs do not trigger A1

measurement and do not return to the uplink good coverage zone. Configurations of

the ReportConfigSearch.qciA1A2UlThrOffsets attribute that

decrease the effective value of the search threshold under 320 can prevent this

behavior for configured QCIs.

The Critical Threshold

To detect that the UE has encountered uplink critical coverage, A2 measurements are

started on the node when the UE attaches to the cell. The report configuration for

this is based on parameters in the ReportConfigSearch MO.

The report configurations for this measurement are not affected by the Service

Triggered Mobility and Multi-Layer Service-Triggered Mobility features.

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

This feature enhances network capacity by moving UEs to the best available frequency

in the network.

Capacity and Performance

Moving UEs to different frequencies improves coverage, however, the feature has no

impact on physical cell coverage. When the feature is enabled, UEs can be moved to

cells in different frequencies with better radio conditions more often.

When the feature is enabled together with the High Power UE feature, uplink coverage

is improved by moving high power UEs to cells where high power UE capability is

allowed.

The number of handovers to LTE and IRAT cells is increased at poor uplink radio

conditions for LTE cells. Uplink radio conditions can be measured independently of

downlink radio conditions. This means that that unnecessary handovers are

avoided.

For a UE with critical uplink radio conditions in the cell, a blind handover is

attempted to an LTE or an IRAT cell. If handover is not possible, the UE is released

and redirected to a better LTE or IRAT cell. The number of abnormal releases because

of poor uplink radio conditions is decreased.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011072 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011072 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility

This feature must be configured to ensure that it is operable.

The following requirements must be fulfilled at feature activation:

- The Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature must be activated.
- To configure UE redirection at poor uplink coverage, information about other carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during network configuration according to the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature.
- The settings must be adjusted for the following events so that they are internally reported in the eNodeB when required: Table 6 Events Reported in the Node Event Description A1 measurement Uplink Good Coverage The event detects when the UE has good uplink coverage. A2 measurement Uplink Search The event detects when the UE enters the uplink search zone. A2 measurement Uplink Critical Coverage The event detects when the UE has critical uplink coverage.

When the UE enters the uplink search zone, the eNodeB can configure A5 measurements

in the UE to search for alternative frequencies. This is controlled by the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveIF attribute.

When a UE enters the uplink search zone, the eNodeB can configure B2 measurements

in the UE to search for alternative RANs. This is controlled by the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveGERAN and the

UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveUTRAN attributes.

Observability of the uplink quality in the network can be enabled without a license for

the feature by configuring the ENodeBFunction.enabledUlTrigMeas

attribute.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q4: IRAT Handover at Bad Uplink Radio Conditions

The enhancement of Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility enables better retainability and mobility in network deployment scenarios with uplink problems where IRAT cells are available.

| Feature Name:           | Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1797 R2                             |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R9                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                         |

The enhancement of Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility introduces the possibility of IRAT

handover to UTRAN or GERAN, by enabling to configure a UE with B2 IRAT Event in bad

uplink radio conditions. This results in better retainability and mobility in network

deployment scenarios with uplink problems where IRAT cells are available.

Capacity and Performance

The number of handover to IRAT cells is increased at bad uplink radio conditions for LTE

cells.

This decreases packet loss rate due to bad uplink radio conditions and per QCI,

improves throughput and VoIP integrity.

The benefits of the enhancement can be observed using counter

pmB2BestCellEvalReportUl.

Operation

New MO Classes are introduced for configuration of B2 Event thresholds:

- ReportConfigB2UtraUlTrig to configure UTRA B2 Event measurements
- ReportConfigB2GeranUlTrig to configure GERAN B2 Event measurements

The following MO Classes are removed, as handover to CDMA2000 is not supported:

- ReportConfigB2CdmaUlTrig
- ReportConfigB2CdmaRttUlTrig

Interfaces

The change affects the RRC protocol on the Uu interface.

IRAT Event B2 can be started on the UE in the UL Search Zone. This affects the following

information elements  for UTRA and GERAN measurements within

ReportConfigInterRAT information element:

- b2-Threshold1
- hysteresis
- timeToTrigger
- maxReportCells
- reportInterval
- reportAmount
- ThresholdUTRA utra-RSCP utra-EcN0
- ThresholdGERAN

## Appendix A.b: 17.Q4: Mobility Actions at Critical Uplink Quality

Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility enhancement introduces the possibility of

blind handover and release with redirect to E-UTRAN inter-frequency or IRAT cells at a

configured critical coverage threshold.

| Feature Name:           | Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility   |

| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1797 R2                             |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R9                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                         |

The enhancement of Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility introduces the possibility

of blind handover and release with redirect to E-UTRAN inter-frequency or IRAT cells at

a configured critical coverage threshold. This results in better retainability and

integrity in network deployment scenarios with uplink problems.

Capacity and Performance

The number of handover to LTE or IRAT cells is increased at critical uplink radio

conditions for LTE cells.

This decreases packet loss rate due to bad uplink radio conditions and per QCI,

improves throughput and VoIP integrity.
