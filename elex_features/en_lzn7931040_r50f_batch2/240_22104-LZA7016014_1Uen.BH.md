# 1 Coverage-Adapted Load Management Overview

The Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature is an add-on feature to other features.

The feature optimizes the load to be transferred to neighboring cells.

Summary

The Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature is an add-on to the following Load

Management features and it must be operated with at least one of them:

- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload
- Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

The purpose of the Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature is to optimize the amount

of load to be transferred to neighboring LTE and WCDMA cells. The feature also

optimizes the amount of required inter-frequency measurements and IRAT measurements

for load balancing. The optimization is performed based on the available coverage

overlap between the source cell and the neighboring cells. This is also estimated by

at least one of the following best neighbor relations features:

- Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management
- Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload

This optimization potentially enhances the load-balancing performance in most network

scenarios. This includes heterogeneous networks, where different cell sizes can

exist in the same network.

The Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature has the following benefits:

- The load balancing or offload can efficiently utilize the capacity of small cells. This also reduces the load on macro cells.
- The waste of load management effort is avoided in the target cells.
- This feature optimizes the number of inter-frequency measurements or IRAT measurements initiated for load management.
- Load management can handle large numbers of load-balancing relations with better efficiency. This means allowing more neighbor cells to be used for load balancing or offload without negatively affecting the performance.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of Coverage-Adapted Load Management

At least one load balancing feature and a best neighboring relation featu needs to be activated

before activating the Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Adapted Load Management

The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing, Inter-Frequency Offload, and Inter-RAT Offload to

WCDMA features share a similar load balancing action step. As an add-on feature to these three

features, the Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature enhances the load balancing action

step.

Load Balancing Action

In the load balancing action step, each source cell determines the amount of traffic load

to be handed over to each target E-UTRAN or UTRAN cell to balance the load differences. In

the determinations, several parameters and criteria are considered.

The Coverage-Adapted Load Management feature enhances the load balancing action step. This

is realized by considering an extra criterion along with the existing ones. The extra

criterion is related to the coverage overlap between the source cell and target cells. The

coverage overlap is referred to as hit rate in the Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management and Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload features.

If multiple target cells exist, the total amount of traffic load to be handed over from the

source cell is divided among the target cells. The divided load considers the available hit

rate of target cells towards the source cell.

The adaptation of handover amount based on the available hit rate makes it possible to

allow load balancing towards multiple target cells without negatively affecting the

performance. The target cells can be with low hit rate, such as pico cells.

Load Balancing Relation Configuration

Load balancing relations are configured in the source cell towards each target cell. The

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing or

UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing parameter activates load balancing in

one direction from the source cell to the target E-UTRAN or UTRAN cell.

The Best Neighbor Relations for Intra-LTE Load Management and Best Neighbor Relations for WCDMA IRAT Offload features

automatically determine and configure the

EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing and

UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing parameters for the load balancing

relations. The neighbor cells with low hit rate, such as pico cells, cannot automatically be

configured as load balancing relation.

If it is necessary to consider such target cells for load balancing, the

EUtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated or

UtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated parameter of the target cells must be

set to TRUE. This happens when the Coverage-Adapted Load Management

feature is operable. When the load balancing evaluates the best neighbor cells, the total

hit rate on the corresponding target frequency is considered, instead of the individual hit

rate of such cells. If the Overlaid Cell Detection feature is operable the

EUtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated parameter of the target cells is

automatically set to TRUE. For details, see document Overlaid Cell Detection.

The total hit rate per frequency is defined as the sum of the hit rate for the following

target cells on a certain frequency:

- Cells with EUtranCellRelation.loadBalancing or UtranCellRelation.loadBalancing are set to ALLOWED or OFFFLOAD.
- Cells with EUtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated or UtranCellRelation.lbCovIndicated are set to TRUE.
