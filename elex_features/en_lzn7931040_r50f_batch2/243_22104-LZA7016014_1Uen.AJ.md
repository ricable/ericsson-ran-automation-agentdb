# 3 Feature Operation of IFLB Activation Threshold

The feature reduces UE measurements for IFLB by introducing a frequency-based load

threshold.

The load balancing in the Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is based on the load

information received from other cells. Each source cell determines the amount of traffic

load that is handed over to each target cell, to balance the load differences.

The load balancing is triggered as soon as relatively low enough load is reported from

neighbor cells. Signaling and UE measurements are ordered even though the load in source

cell is low.

With this feature IFLB is triggered towards a target cell only if:

- The load in source cell is above the pre-configured load threshold for the target frequency cell.
- The load difference is larger than the pre-configured load difference threshold.

Example 1   Load Balancing Between Cells with

Different Thresholds

| Inter-frequency Load Balancing is triggered to target cell 1     |    | If the load in the serving cell is greater than the frequency based load                             threshold corresponding to the frequency of target cell 1 plus the                             pre-configured minimum load difference.   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Inter-frequency Load Balancing is not triggered to target cell 2 |    | If the load in the serving cell is smaller than the frequency based load                             threshold corresponding to the frequency of target cell 2 plus the                             pre-configured minimum load difference.   |

# 4 Network Impact of IFLB Activation Threshold

IFLB action is not triggered to a target frequency cell if the load in source cell is

below the pre-configured load threshold.
