# 1 Inter-Frequency OTDOA Overview

The feature allows the UE to take PRS measurements in cells which use a different

frequency from the one used by the serving cell.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                                      |

| Value Package Name:     | Location Support                                         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0419                                             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature improves the accuracy of the positioning-related measurements by increasing the

number of cells to measure.

The feature offers the following benefits:

- The UE can take PRS measurements from cells using frequencies that differ from the serving cell frequency.
- It can provide more accurate position calculations since more cells can be measured.

When using                                 Inter-Frequency OTDOA and OTDOA PRS Management features together, it                                 is recommended to use different PRSConfigIndex                                 for cells on the same eNodeB which are using different frequencies.                                 This is to ensure that a UE which is using one cell on the eNodeB as                                 a serving cell and another cell on the same eNodeB as an                                 Inter-Frequency cell for OTDOA have the best chance to be able to                                 measure the Inter-Frequency PRS signal during its measurement gap.                                 If the same PRSConfigIndex is used, then the PRS                                 signals for the serving cell and Inter-Frequency cell occur at the                                 same time which makes it more difficult for the UE to be able to                                 measure both signals. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

- The E-SMLC node must operate correctly.

# 3 Feature Operation of Inter-Frequency OTDOA

The feature allows the UE to take PRS measurements in cells which use a different

frequency from the one used by the serving cell.

When the E-SMLC requests measurements from the UE to locate it, the UE receives a set of

measurement parameters which include the following:

- The inter-frequency cells to measure
- The frequencies on which these cells operate
- The offset (which is the measPRS-Offset parameter) of the location of the PRS on the measured cells Note: The offset takes the reference point from the SFN 0 of the serving cell. Figure 1 Example for the measPRS-Offset calculation
measPRS-Offset\_calculation

![Image](../images/244_22104-LZA7016014_1Uen.AK/additional_3_CP.png)

After the UE receives the parameters about which inter-frequency cell to measure, and the

offset needed for the gap is created, the UE builds and sends the RRC

InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message to the serving eNodeB to

request a measurement gap. When the UE gets the acknowledgment that the gap is created, the UE

measures the inter-frequency cell. The UE keeps sending the RRC

InterFreqRSTDMeasurementIndication message and then measuring the

inter-frequency cell until all measurements are completed.

# 4 Network Impact of Inter-Frequency OTDOA

The feature has no network impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implications of Inter-Frequency OTDOA

This feature allows the UE to take PRS measurements in cells which use a different

frequency from the one used by the serving cell.

This feature improves accuracy of the positioning-related measurements by increasing the

number of cells to measure. The location information of the UE will be known.

# 7 Activate Inter-Frequency OTDOA

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The OTDOA Control Plane Location Support or the OTDOA User Plane Location Support feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011804 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Inter-Frequency OTDOA

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011804 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
