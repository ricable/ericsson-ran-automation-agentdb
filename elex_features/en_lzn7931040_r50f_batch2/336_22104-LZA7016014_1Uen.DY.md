Summary

The suitable LAA carrier frequency is the one least occupied with interfering

traffic.

The Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) function allows for the eNodeB to select the

suitable LAA carrier frequencies automatically from the allowed frequencies in the

unlicensed spectrum. An LBT algorithm ensures that the carrier is free before

transmission.

LAA SCells are downlink-only and up to three LAA SCells can be configured.

Figure 1   Principle of License-Assisted Access with Three SCells

The feature has the following benefits:

- The licensed spectrum is available for other purposes in areas with LAA deployment.
- A large amount of bandwidth available in the unlicensed 5 GHz band can be used for mobile broadband to increase downlink data throughput.

Hardware

The feature is supported on Radio 2205.

Limitations

- The primary cell must be configured as FDD only.
- The feature is only supported for best effort traffic.
- To use external LAA SCells, all Elastic RAN requirements must be fulfilled.
- The eNodeB configures LAA-capable UEs with LAA SCells only from the same radio unit. For example, if the coverage of two LAA radio units overlaps, the UE is configured with the SCells only from one radio unit based on the SCell signal strength.
- The value of the EUtranCellTDD.channelBandwidth attribute must be 20000 for LAA cells.
- To assure the consistency of DRS configuration, the change of DRS parameters, UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaDrsOffset and UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaDrsPeriodicity, is allowed only when all LAA cells are in LOCKED state.
- In multi-node deployment, a PCell with the Elastic RAN feature can have carrier aggregation relations to LAA SCells from multiple neighboring nodes. A PCell can have carrier aggregation relations to LAA SCells from only one LAA radio from each neighboring node.
- If the LAA-only eNodeB deployment is set up without an S1 connection, automatic connection to the DNS and obtaining IP address from the DNS is not possible.
- UE Wi-Fi measurement reports are not supported.

Network Requirements

Single node configuration requires ENM version 17.9 or above.

Multi-node configuration requires ENM version 18.16 or above.

UE supporting 3GPP Release 13 or above is required for the feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

By the operation of this feature a licensed FDD band can be combined with unlicensed

downlink carriers in the 5-GHz band for improving peak throughput.

Feature Operation

The licensed spectrum is expensive. A large portion of the unlicensed spectrum is

available in the 5-GHz band mainly used by Wi-Fi.

Figure 2   Unlicensed 5-GHz Spectrum

The Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access feature enables LTE to operate

in the 5-GHz unlicensed spectrum, Band 46.

Figure 3   License-Assisted Access Principle

Regulations for LAA Use

The unlicensed 5-GHz spectrum can be acquired according to regulations. For example,

the following regional regulations must be accomplished:

- Handling regulatory requirements, for example, allowed frequencies, output power, regional restrictions
- Avoiding parts of the spectrum blocked for radars or other reasons
- Avoiding transmission when the channel is occupied
- Ensuring fair use regarding Wi-Fi and other access technologies

Fair use is achieved by using LBT, Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), and complying

with the regulatory requirements.

Figure 4   Regulatory Requirements Affecting Allowed Frequencies

The MOM framework defines the parts of the unlicensed spectrum that can be used by

the eNodeB.

The feature operation is defined by MOM parameters.

The feature uses a similar algorithm as the Carrier Aggregation feature. The SCell in

the unlicensed band is configured as downlink only.

The feature supports up to three simultaneous LAA cells as SCells. All these SCells

are either local to the eNodeB or external SCells. Only LAA SCells configured with

SectorCarrier MO using the same

SectorEquipmentFunction can be aggregated

together.

The LAA cell is supported for 2x2 MIMO.

Listen Before Talk

Figure 5   Listen Before Talk Process

LBT is also known as Clear Channel Assessment. It is performed in the radio to ensure

that the carrier is free before transmission. The request to perform LBT is

triggered by transmitting either DRS, data (PDSCH), or both on the LAA cell. Once

the carrier is acquired, transmission must start or the opportunity to transmit is

lost. If LBT fails, transmission is not allowed, and a new LBT is started in the

following subframe.

The DRS is transmitted on regular occasions to enable the UE to detect LAA SCells, to

maintain synchronization with the eNodeB, and to perform and report DRS

measurements.

The following attributes control the DRS configuration:

- UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaDrsOffset It is recommended to set to a multiplication of 5, for example, 0, 5 (default), 10 or 15.
- UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaDrsPeriodicity It is recommended to set to 40. (default).

DRS transmission has priority over PDSCH transmission. PDSCH transmission overlapping

DRS opportunity can be interrupted to allow all LAA cells placed on the same radio

unit to send DRS.

If the LAA SCells are acquired for data transmission, they are released again when

there is no more data to transmit, or when the

UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaMaxOccupancy time

elapsed.

LBT for multicarrier can be performed according to the following two different

channel access procedures for transmissions on multiple carriers:

| Type A   |    | The eNodeB performs a separate LBT on more than one unlicensed                                 carrier. The eNodeB is allowed to transmit DRS, PDSCH, or both on                                 the carriers that complete LBT with potential self-deferral to align                                 transmission over multiple carriers.   |
|----------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Type B   |    | One carrier is the primary carrier and the rest are secondary                                 carriers. The full LBT is performed on the primary carrier. For the                                 secondary carriers, a shorter sensing interval of 25 µs is used.                                                                           |

QCIs

Downlink LAA is defined with four different priority classes mapped to standardized

QCI. Channel Access Priority Class 3 is supported, therefore, only QCI 4, QCI 6, QCI

8, and QCI 9 traffic classes can be set up on LAA SCells.

The LAA Support for the Operator Defined QCIs enhancement enables the use of LAA

cells to transmit data associated with operator defined QCIs. This enhancement also

enables the possibility to exclude predefined QCIs that are already able to support

LAA traffic from being used on LAA cells.

Dynamic Channel Selection

Figure 6   Dynamic Channel Selection

The DCS function enables the eNodeB to select a suitable LAA carrier automatically

from the allowed frequencies in the unlicensed spectrum. Channel evaluation on the

selected carrier is done periodically.

If the eNodeB determines that the current carrier has bad radio conditions, or if the

channel is too congested, it measures the other carriers and chooses another carrier

that is less occupied. DCS selects the most suitable channels based on its

algorithm. It means that DCS selects the same channels on each LAA radio without

considering if the LAA coverage overlaps.

The UEs are notified about which new channel to use when RRC connection

reconfiguration occurs, where the SCell information is contained. The DCS behavior

can be controlled by MOM parameter settings.

UE Capability and Configuration

During UE attach, the process checks if the feature is enabled in the eNodeB.

The UE can be configured with an LAA SCell if it supports LAA and the frequency band

that is used by the LAA cell. The UE must support a band combination between the

PCell and the LAA SCell for the required carrier aggregation level.

The UE can be configured with a mixed combination of licensed FDD SCells and LAA

SCells if the UE supports this mixed combination.

Figure 7   UE Capability Message Sequence

The eNodeB checks the LAA capability of the UE, as follows:

1. The eNodeB sends a UECapabilityEnquiry request to the UE for the UE capabilities.
2. The UE sends information about LAA capabilities to the eNodeB in the UECapabilityInformation message with LAA-Parameters-r13 IE.

Network Impact of Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

## 3.1 X2 Setup with LAA SCells

The feature can provide X2 setup configuration with only LAA SCells on one eNodeB in

an Elastic RAN cluster.

For the configuration to work, there must be at least one eNodeB with a PCell as a main

serving cell. The LAA-only eNodeB is treated as supplemental unlicensed downlink only.

Separate channel lists must be set for every LAA sector on the same eNodeB, to provide

DCS without a PCell on the secondary eNodeB.

The X2 SETUP REQUEST message is triggered when the

TermPointToENB MO is manually created and unlocked. With this

solution, IP address is obtained automatically by using DNS.

When the TermPointToENB MO is unlocked on an LAA-only secondary

eNodeB, the Served Cell Information IE in the X2 SETUP

REQUEST message is sent with a dummy PCell information. The primary eNodeB

is configured to ignore the dummy PCell information from LAA-only secondary eNodeBs.

The following node types exist in this configuration setup:

| Primary eNodeB   |    | Node with serving cell    |
|------------------|----|---------------------------|
|                  |    |                           |
| Secondary eNodeB |    | Node with LAA-only SCells |

When the TermPointToENB MO is unlocked on the primary eNodeB, the

following applies:

1. The primary eNodeB sends the X2 SETUP REQUEST message to the secondary eNodeB.
2. The secondary eNodeB checks if Served Cell Information IE receives in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message contains dummy PCell information. If it does not, the secondary eNodeB sends Served Cell Information IE with dummy PCell information in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message.
3. After the primary eNodeB receives the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, it checks if the message contains Served Cell Information IE with the dummy PCell information.
4. X2 connection is set up.

When the TermPointToENB MO is unlocked on the secondary eNodeB, the

following applies:

1. The secondary eNodeB sends the Served Cell Information IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message with the dummy PCell information.
2. The primary eNodeB checks if the X2 SETUP REQUEST message contains dummy PCell information. If it does, the primary eNodeB performs as specified for Elastic RAN cluster and sends X2 SETUP RESPONSE message.
3. After the secondary eNodeB receives the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, it checks if the message contains Served Cell Information IE with the dummy PCell information.
4. X2 connection is set up.

# 4 Network Impact of Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

The feature increases downlink throughput for LAA-capable UEs.

Capacity and Performance

The downlink throughput gain is expected to be the highest at the lowest load and in

good radio conditions. It gives the highest probability that the UE can use all

additional bandwidth in the SCell. Up to three simultaneous LAA SCells with 20-MHz

bandwidth are supported.

The potential offload of licensed carriers can improve performance for

non-LAA-capable devices as well. The radio environment in the unlicensed band is

expected to be more demanding than in the licensed bands. This introduces a risk of

impairing the radio link performance, which can manifest as an increased drop rate

for LAA capable UEs.

Traffic on LAA carriers cannot guarantee the quality of service since the spectrum is

shared with other access technologies and the data transmission is not assured.

The unreliability of the LAA carrier makes LAA only suitable for best effort traffic.

To guarantee VoLTE performance, no VoLTE traffic is sent in the unlicensed band.

UDP is expected to work better than TCP. The stability of the carrier is important.

for TCP. Since the LAA carrier availability shares a carrier with Wi-Fi, TCP is

expected to have a poorer performance.

The feature throughput depends on how much access it has to the unlicensed spectrum,

that is, the LBT success rate. The maximum of 88% (12% defer period) throughput is

expected compared to a normal 20-MHz SCell (FDD) if the theoretical throughput has

the following characteristics:

- 100% LBT success rate
- No retransmission
- A maximum of 8 ms continuous transmission time
- Channel Access Priority Class 3

Multiple LAA radios on one PCell provide better coverage for moderate and high

traffic demands for LAA-capable UEs. It can increase the configuration time for

LAA-capable UEs in the coverage area of the LAA SCell. The increase is proportional

to the number of LAA SCells configured as secondary cells to the PCell.

Using LAA-only eNodeB deployment without S1 connection reduces network load and

internal memory use.

The maximum number of local LAA cells associated with a PCell is limited to the

capacity of the eNodeB, that is, the maximum number of cells supported on the

eNodeB.

For overlapping LAA SCell coverage, it is recommended to configure LAA static channel

selection with non-DFS frequencies. If the coverages of two or more LAA SCells with

the same frequencies overlap, the performance is degraded because of

interference.

# 7 Activate Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

The Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access feature activation is

different for single eNodeB configuration and for multi-eNodeB configuration.

This feature needs special attention to be activated for multi-eNodeB

configuration.

For multi-eNodeB configuration, the followings steps must be executed:

1. Block TermPointToENBs on all nodes.
2. Enable the license for the Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access feature on all nodes.
3. Deblock TermPointToENB pointing to eNodeB on all nodes.

Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the regulative requirements for radio use in the unlicensed 5-GHz band in the region or country where the system is installed, for example, available frequency bands, maximum allowed transmission time, transmit power.
- The license key is installed on the node.
- MBMS for LAA SCells is disabled: there must not be any MbsfnAreaCellRelation where mbsfnAreaCellRef refers to an LAA SCell.
- The prerequisite features are activated and enabled on the node.
- The conflicting features are disabled or deactivated.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012020 MO instance. Note: For detailed configuration and activation instructions, see Enable Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012020 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines

The feature must be configured according to the regional regulations.

Regional Regulative Requirements for Radio Use

The unlicensed 5-GHz spectrum can be used according to regional restrictions.

Before configuring the feature, it is important to know all information concerning

the regulative requirements for radio use in the 5-GHz band in the region or country

where the system is installed.

Collect the following information:

- Maximum transmission time
- Allowed frequencies in unlicensed sub-bands
- EIRP, maximum output power in unlicensed sub-band
- Cable attenuation
- Antenna gain
- Maximum number of LAA carriers to be configured for UE (1CC, 2CC, 3CC)

Channel Setting

Since regional regulative requirements of power for unlicensed devices (EIRP) are

different for unlicensed sub-bands, for example FCC UNII-1&amp;3 are different from

UNII-2, therefore power is set in UnlicensedBandProfile for each

channel planned to be used in deployment.

The maxUnlicensedTxPower struct member of the

UnlicensedFrequencyProperties.unlicensedBandProfileList

attribute defines the maximum cell output power when the given channel is used by an

LAA cell.

The SectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute, which is

typically used to define sector power for LTE cells, is used for power setting of

LAA cells. If configuredMaxTxPower is set for LAA cell, it is

internally overwritten by the value of maxUnlicensedTxPower if

the latter has a lower value.

The power settings of the channels in UnlicensedBandProfile are

calculated based on the following:

- Regional regulatory power limits for the unlicensed sub-bands 46A, 46B, 46C, or 46D
- Radio unit maximum power limits for the given antenna type
- Number of aggregated carriers planned for aggregation 1CC, 2CC, or 3CC

The following steps make up the process of setting the channels in

UnlicensedBandProfile:

1. Investigate the local regulations of EIRP and the maximum conducted power for the unlicensed sub-band in use.
2. Check the maximum power limit of Radio 2205 for the given sub-band and antenna type, see Radio 2205 Description.
3. Distribute the maximum power limit, or lower the amount if the maximum power is not needed, between the number of planned carriers. Note: Equal amount of power distribution is recommended between the carriers.
4. Use the value calculated in Step 3 to set maxUnlicensedTxPower for all sub-band channels in UnlicensedBandProfile.

Example 1

Example 1 shows the deployment on Radio 2205 according to FCC regulations with the

following properties:

- External Antenna Gain = 6 dBi
- Three LAA SCells, maximum power limit split equally

- Conflicting features are disabled or deactivated.
- Disable MBMS for LAA SCells so no MbsfnAreaCellRelation.mbsfnAreaCellRef instance is created which refers to an LAA SCell.
- Using the MOM structure involving the Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access cell is not allowed. This ensures the following: Handover to SCell is not allowed. Load balancing is disabled. Mobility measurements are not allowed. Mobility for a voice session is prevented. ANR does not perform measurements on LAA frequencies. This prevents the eNodeB from creating downlink only cell relations.

Steps

1. Lock the cell.
2. Set the EUtranCellTDD.isDlOnly and EUtranCellTDD.isLaa attribute to true.
3. The SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas attribute must be set to 1 or 2 in accordance with Radio 2205 limitations. For Radio 2205 supporting LAA cells, only one Rx antenna is used to perform listen-before-talk measurements if SectorCarrier.noOfRxAntennas is set to 1. Note: Changes only allowed if the cell MO is locked.
4. Create an UnlicensedAccessFunction MO instance.
5. Set the UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaChannelSelectionType attribute to DYNAMIC\_CHANNEL\_SELECTION.
6. Create an UnlicensedBandProfile MO instance.
    - Set the members in the UnlicensedBandProfile.unlicensedBandProfileList attribute according to regulatory requirements and go to Step Step 7. Perform the steps for each LAA SCell to configure different channels. When all channels are configured, go to Step 10.
    - Create a SectorEquipmentFunction MO instance and go to Step 10.
7. Create an EUtranFreqRelationUnlicensed MO instance with reference to the UnlicensedBandProfile MO.
8. Create an EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed MO instance.
9. Set the EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.earfcn attribute to the value that corresponds with the chosen channel. Example Attribute values to configure channel EARFCN 51090. Attribute Attribute Member Value UnlicensedBandProfile.unlicensedBandProfileList channelCharacteristic CHANNEL\_ENABLED maxUnlicensedTxPower 74 unlicensedBand BAND\_46C unlicensedEarfcn EARFCN\_51090 EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed.earfcn N/A 51090
10. Unlock the cell.

## 9.5 Carrier Frequency Offsets

Figure 8   Band 46 Channel Spacing

Channel spacing in band 46 (5 GHz) requires the following properties:

- Channel spacing must be a multiple of 300 kHz, so 19.8 MHz or 20.1 MHz
- Center frequency must not differ more than ±200 kHz from Wi-Fi channel center frequency
- Channel bandwidth must not cross sub-band boundaries. For example, the last channel in 46A cannot overlap with 46B.

Static channel selection requires EARFCNs with

offsets, see

Table 7.

## 9.6 LAA Deployment Scenarios

The PCell can have Carrier Aggregation relations to LAA SCells from multiple LAA radios.

The Supplemental Downlink with License-Assisted Access feature performs efficiently if

LAA SCells configured with the same SectorCarrier MOs and

SectorEquipmentFunction MOs are chosen to be aggregated

together.

In a multi-node deployment scenario, a PCell with an active Elastic RAN feature can have

Carrier Aggregation relations to LAA SCells from multiple neighboring nodes.

## 9.7 QCIs through LAA Cells

LAA cells can only be used for predefined QCIs that are part of Channel Access Priority

Class 3: QCI 4, 6, 8, and 9. The QciProfilePredefined.laaSupported

attribute for these QCIs is set to true by default. For other

predefined QCIs, the recommended value of this attribute is false.

The QciProfileOperatorDefined.laaSupported attribute is only

recommended to set to true for operator defined QCIs whose

characteristics are similar to Channel Access Priority Class 3 QCIs. The characteristics

to consider are the following:

| Resource type          |    | Non-GBR is preferred. GBR is only supported if all other characteristics                             are similar to QCI 4. See 3GPP 23.203 table 6.1.7 for more                             information on QCI characteristics.   |

The Elastic RAN with License-Assisted Access enhancement provides support for Elastic RAN

CA using License-Assisted Access carriers. This enhancement decreases load on cells

using licensed spectrum.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement has a minor impact on X2 load because of the following:

- An increase in size of X2 private messages
- A minor increase of memory usage due to new parameters
- An increase on processor load due to additional computing required due to more frequent ESCell evaluation

Operation

This enhancement depends on both Elastic RAN and LAA licenses to be operable,

external secondary LAA cells can be used for carrier aggregation only when Elastic

RAN and LAA licenses are operable on both master eNodeB and external eNodeB Elastic

RAN partners.

The LAA ESCell and PCell relations in Elastic RAN CA are defined by

EUtranCellRelationUnlicensed MO. This MO references

ExternalEUtranCellTDD representing LAA ESCell. Because the

ExternalEUtranCellTdd.eutranFrequencyRef is mandatory

reference to EUtranFrequency object an special EUtranFrequency needs to be created

and referenced by an LAA ExternalEUtranCellTDD object with an

ExternalEUtranCellTDD.arfcnValueEUtranDl equal to 47000 needs

to be created and referenced by an LAA ExternalEUtranCellTDD object.

This enhancement implements Detection of Radar Functionality (DFS) that enables LTE to

operate on unlicensed sub-bands where protection of radars is required. The DFS gives

DCS access to a wider range of channels, which might result in better radio conditions

causing a better UE throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Whenever a DFS-required channel is selected by the DCS, the LAA

Scell

enters

a radar monitoring state for 60 seconds (channel availability check) and are

unavailable for LAA service.

Whenever a radar is detected on DFS-required channel, the cell is automatically

locked for the time needed to find another suitable channel (DCS procedure).This

means that the overall cell unavailability time due to DCS procedure can increase

for cells operating on DFS channels comparing to cells operating on non-DFS LAA

channels.

The following CPU

loads are

observed in

LTE:

- A constant 0.7 DSP value for each cell during radio RX state
- An additional 2 DSP value during long radar pulses that are above -64 dBm threshold.
- An approximated 0.3 DSP during TX state for each DFS cell.

Operation

DFS support activation and identification of band 46 channels which are subject to

DFS is automatic and based on MCC value determined from

ENodeBFunction

and

eNodeBPlmnId

attribute.

The pmLaaRadarDetectionDistr PM counter is introduced, that is

incremented when radar is detected on the channel. This counter is individually

pegged to every channel..

Interfaces

The following are implemented by this enhancement:

- Baseband modules are able to detect if the current channel requires radar monitoring as a part of regulatory requirement.
- RAC should inform Baseband sub-modules in cell setup request about the current regulatory body.

The localCellSetupReq message is updated with the following new parameters:

- laaDfsStandardRegulatory
- earfcnUL

The following messages are introduced by this enhancement:

- localCellStartSchedulingReq
- localCellStartSchedulingCfm
- localCellRadarDetectionInd

No impact.

Hardware

After radar detection, the channel is unavailable for a time specified by FCC, which

is 30 minutes.

The LAA DFS cells are only supported on Radio 2205 KRC 161 609/2.

Higher spectrum efficiency is achieved with a larger peak downlink throughput with 14

MIMO layers. 14 MIMO layers are achieved with a mix of licensed and unlicensed LAA

cells.

The feature enhancement increases flexibility for LAA Carrier Aggregation. It also

increases the area covered by LAA SCells on the same sector by enabling multiple LAA

radios on the same PCell.

Capacity and Performance

Multiple LAA radios on one PCell provide better coverage for moderate and high

traffic demands for LAA-capable UEs. Sometimes, this can increase the configuration

time for LAA-capable UEs in the coverage area of the LAA SCell. The increase is

proportional to the number of LAA SCells configured as secondary cell to the

PCell.

The maximum number of local LAA cells associated for a PCell is limited to the

capacity of the eNodeB, that is the maximum number of cells supported on the

eNodeB.

Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) selects the most suitable channels based on its

algorithm. This can mean that DCS selects the same channels on each LAA radio

without considering if the LAA coverage overlaps.

For overlapping LAA SCell coverage, it is recommended to configure LAA static channel

selection with non DFS frequencies. If the coverage of two or more LAA SCells with

the same frequencies overlap, the performance is degraded because of

interference.

The enhancement has the following limitations:

- The eNodeB configures LAA-capable UEs with LAA SCells only from the same radio unit. Therefore, UEs cannot be configured with a mix of LAA SCells from two or more radios. For example, if the coverage of two LAA radio overlaps, the UE is configured with the SCells from only one radio based on the SCell signal strength.
- In a multi-node deployment scenario, a PCell with the Elastic RAN feature activated can have Carrier Aggregation relations to LAA SCells from multiple neighboring nodes. A PCell can have Carrier Aggregation relations to LAA SCells from only one LAA radio from each neighboring node.

Operation

It is recommended to set the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute to

ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION or

ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION. If the attribute is set to

UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION, the performance of the UE

can be negatively affected. In this case some UEs do not report A2 measurements of

LAA SCells with bad coverage, therefore, the re-selection to another SCell cannot

occur.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

## Appendix A.f: 19.Q4: Separated Sector Unlicensed Channel List

This feature enhancement introduces a simplified configuration that does not require a

dummy EUtranFrequency MO or a dummy value for the

EUtranFrequency.arfcnValueEUtranDl attribute to be created for

LAA ESCells. The feature enhancement defines LAA configurations under the

UnlicensedAccessFunction MO only.

Although the old configuration is still supported, it is planned to be removed so it is

recommended to use the new configuration structure. This feature enhancement provides

automatic conversion of existing LAA ESCells to the new configuration structure.

Benefits

This feature enhancement improves observability by measuring traffic of LAA SCells

and ESCells on the MAC layer.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

UnlicensedAccessFunction.convertExternalLaaCells MO action.

The MO action automatically converts configuration to the new MO structure by

copying ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO values to

ExternalEUtranCellUnlicensed MO.

## Appendix A.i: LAA Secondary Cell Activation Based on QCI

This enhancement prevents the activation of LAA SCells for non-LAA

traffic.

LAA SCells are only able to transmit Channel Access Priority Class 3 traffic. This

corresponds to traffic with the following QCIs:

- QCI 4
- QCI 6
- QCI 8
- QCI 9

Without this enhancement, LAA SCells are activated regardless of traffic type. The LAA

SCells start to process the data request, but since the non-LAA data cannot be

transmitted it can lead to a situation when the LAA SCell resources are not utilized.

With this enhancement LAA SCells are only activated when there is Channel Access

Priority Class 3 traffic. This results in better use of the LAA SCells.

Capacity and Performance

If LAA SCells are only activated for Channel Access Priority Class 3 traffic, the

value of the following counters can decrease:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActivatedDlSum
- EUtranCellFDD.pmLaaActivatedSum
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCaActivatedDlFddTddSum

The decrease in the value of the counters is because of the better use of the LAA

cells. The LAA cells are not activated for traffic that they cannot transmit. This

means that the counters are only stepped for the traffic that the LAA SCell can

transmit.

Operation

If the UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaSCellActDeactDataThres

attribute is set to a value other than −1, LAA SCells are only activated for UEs

with QCI 4, QCI 6, QCI 8, and QCI 9 traffic.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

## Appendix A.j: 19.Q4: Accelerated LAA Secondary Cell Scheduling

This enhancement improves scheduling of LAA DRS signal. Prioritization of LAA over

non-LAA SCells during activation procedure is introduced and the activation of LAA SCells

for non-LAA traffic can be prevented.

The activation procedure of secondary carriers affects the use and scheduling of SCells.

This enhancement introduces the following improvements for carrier aggregation

configurations with LAA:

- Improved DRS scheduling to reduce activation time.
- LAA carriers can be activated only for LAA-supported traffic.
- Activation of LAA carriers is preferred over non-LAA carriers when LAA-supported traffic is present.

The enhancement improves DRS scheduling on LAA SCells to optimize CQI measurements and

reporting. This leads to higher use of LAA SCells. The following changes are introduced

to the activation procedure:

- LAA DRS is scheduled for every DMTC period on LAA SCell.
- LAA DRS is only scheduled in subframes #0 and #5.

Without this enhancement, LAA SCells are activated regardless of traffic type, based on

the sum of data from all bearers. The non-LAA data cannot be transmitted through LAA

cells. This can lead to a situation where the non-LAA SCells are not considered for

transmitting data or their activation is delayed. This means that all the data is

transmitted through the PCell. With this enhancement LAA SCells are activated based on

sum of data from LAA-only bearers. This results in the correct use of the SCells based

on traffic type. The following QCIs are supported for LAA:

- QCI 4
- QCI 6
- QCI 8
- QCI 9

Capacity and Performance

Average LAA SCell activation time is improved as a result of improved DRS

scheduling.

The improved DRS scheduling can be observed with the following counters:

- pmLbtDrsAtt
- pmLbtDrsSucc

For carrier aggregation configurations with both LAA and non-LAA carriers, the

prioritization of LAA over non-LAA SCells during activation procedure leads to

higher use of LAA SCells. This can be observed with the following counters:

- pmRadioThpVolDlSCell
- pmLbtPdschAtt
- pmLbtPdschSucc

Activation of LAA SCells based on data from bearers supported only on LAA can lead to

the decrease of the pmLaaActivatedSum counter. This is because no

unnecessary LAA activations happen so LAA cells are not activated for traffic that

they cannot transmit. The counters are only stepped for the traffic that the LAA

SCell can transmit.

Operation

If the UnlicensedAccessFunction.laaSCellActDeactDataThres

attribute is set to a value other than −1, LAA SCells are only activated for UEs

with QCI 4, QCI 6, QCI 8, and QCI 9 traffic.

Capacity and Performance

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement triggers the X2 SETUP REQUEST message when

the TermPointToENB MO is manually created and unlocked. With this

solution, IP address is obtained automatically by using DNS. The Served Cell

Information IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message is sent

with dummy PCell information if this message is sent from an LAA-only eNodeB. This

can have risks of unexpected behavior for other vendors, as they do not expect dummy

PCell information.

If the X2 SETUP REQUEST message is received from an eNodeB with

non-LAA cells, the LAA-only eNodeB responses with the X2 SETUP

RESPONSE message with dummy PCell information.

As the Served Cell Information IE is an ASN.1 decoder requirement but

it is not necessary for this feature enhancement, both primary eNodeBs and LAA-only

secondary eNodeBs are configured to ignore the dummy PCell information. Ignoring the

dummy PCell information depends on the direction and source of the messages.

Hardware

This feature enhancement affects all Baseband units supporting both LAA and

Elastic

RAN. This includes the following Baseband units:

- Baseband 5212
- Baseband 5216
- Baseband 6303
- Baseband 6318
- Baseband 6620
- Baseband 6630

Other Network Elements

This feature enhancement requires ENM version 19.4 or later to be

used.

## Appendix A.l: 20.Q1: LAA-Only eNodeB Deployment without S1 Connection

This feature enhancement allows the use of LAA-only eNodeB deployments with Elastic

RAN, without an S1 connection. All necessary data of ESCells can be managed through an

active X2 connection to the PCell with Elastic RAN.

Benefits

This feature enhancement reduces network load. It also simplifies LAA-only eNodeB

deployment, since additional hardware for E-UTRAN cells is not needed.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement reduces internal memory use, as the configuration of the

TermPointToMme MO instance is not needed to use MME data. It

also enhances network performance by load reduction.

Operation

With this feature enhancement, LAA-only eNodeB is automatically ready to operate

without an active S1 connection if the

TermPointToMme.operationalState attribute is set to

DISABLED or the TermPointToMme MO instance

is removed. The ENodeBFunction.dnsLookupOnTai attribute must be

set to OFF because automatic connection to DNS and, therefore,

obtaining IP address from the DNS is not possible.

The TermPointToENB.ipAddress attribute must be set manually, even

though the TermPointToENB MO instance is created automatically

during the establishment of X2 connection to and from LAA-only eNodeB.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is only supported on Baseband units using LAA and Elastic

RAN.

Other Network Elements

## Appendix A.m: 20.Q2: LAA Support for Operator Defined QCIs

This enhancement allows to control which QCIs can be transmitted through LAA cells in

downlink transmission. It enables support for both operator defined QCIs and predefined QCIs

on LAA cells.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4573                                         |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation                                  |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405                                         |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                  |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                                  |

Benefits

This enhancement enables the use of LAA cells to transmit data associated with

operator defined QCIs. It also enables the possibility to exclude predefined QCIs

that are already able to support LAA traffic from being used on LAA cells.

It can increase the overall amount of data transmitted on LAA cells, increasing the

overall service throughput. The more the network depends on operator defined QCIs,

the bigger the throughput gain.

Capacity and Performance

The benefit of the enhancement can be observed through the following PM counters:

- pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellLaa
- pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExtLaa
- pmCaScheduledDlSum

The enhancement can result in decreased throughput on LTE cells because more QCIs are

scheduled on LAA cells. This can be observed through the following PM counters:

- pmRadioThpVolDlSCell
- pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt

The more the network depends on operator defined QCIs (compared to predefined QCIs),

the bigger the observability impact of the enhancement.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the

QciProfileOperatorDefined.laaSupported and

QciProfilePredefined.laaSupported attributes. The bearer of a

QCI allowed to be used on LAA cells if the MO instance associated with the QCI has

the following configuration:

- QciProfileOperatorDefined.laaSupported set to true
- QciProfileOperatorDefined.serviceType set to UNDEFINED

The enhancement sets the default value of

QciProfilePredefined.laaSupported to true

for QCI 4, 6, 8, and 9. For other QCIs, the value is set to

false.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.2 or later is required.
