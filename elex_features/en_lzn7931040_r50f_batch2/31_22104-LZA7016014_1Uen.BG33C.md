Summary

The purpose of Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature is to ensure that no downlink data packets are lost when performing an X2 Intra-LTE handover, an intra-RBS handover or re-establishment.

With this feature, a connected user can perform handover from one cell to another with minimal disruption to data throughput.

The feature operates both on RLC Acknowledged Mode (AM) and RLC Unacknowledged Mode (UM) DRBs.

# 3 Feature Operation of Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover

If the Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature is activated and the attribute QciProfileOperatorDefined.dataFwdPerQciEnabled or QciProfilePredefined.dataFwdPerQciEnabled is set to TRUE, data forwarding is performed.

The objective of the Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature is to guarantee the reduction of packet loss during an X2 handover and intra-RBS handover. However, this guarantee does not apply in the transport network and to the reduction in handover interruption time. The forwarded packets are those stored in the source eNodeB buffer before handover execution. The packets stored in the buffer have not been acknowledged by the UE (only in case of RLC AM DRBs) and have not been transmitted. The source eNodeB also forwards new incoming packets from the SGW before the handover is complete. Forwarding is only initiated with Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) SDUs in downlink. If the feature is active, the target eNodeB prioritizes all downlink PDCP PDUs forwarded by the source eNodeB before sending new data received from the S1 link.

| Handover Preparation | The source eNodeB attempts the allocation of forwarding transport bearers to the target eNodeB. If this is successful, a forwarding user plane tunnel is established for each E-RAB between the source and target eNodeBs.  Each eNodeB has a source and target data buffer of equal size. The target data buffer holds data packets until a UE attaches to the target cell and the SN STATUS TRANSFER message from the source eNodeB is received on the X2 link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Handover Execution   | When an RRC CONNECTION RECONFIGURATION message is sent to the UE, all buffered and new incoming data are forwarded from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB. To guarantee in-order delivery, the source eNodeB prioritizes the forwarding of PDCP SDUs that have not been acknowledged (only in case of RLC AM DRBs) and transmitted. Forwarding PDCP SDUs happens before new downlink data arriving over S1 is forwarded.  In addition, the PDCP COUNT values are sent for existing AM bearers from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message. The SN STATUS TRANSFER message is forwarded from the source eNodeB on the X2 link.  If no AM bearers are available, the SN STATUS TRANSFER is not sent. When receiving the SN STATUS TRANSFER and detecting the UE, the target eNodeB prioritizes all downlink PDCP SDUs forwarded by the source eNodeB through the X2 link. This is performed before new data—received from the S1 link after a path switch—is sent. |
| Handover Completion  | For an X2 handover to be performed, the target eNodeB sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to the MME. The MME then sends a USER PLANE UPDATE REQUEST message to the SGW. Then the SGW switches the user-plane path from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB. The source eNodeB continues to forward packets, while packets are received from the SGW and the source eNodeB buffer containing data. When the end marker packet is received in the target eNodeB or the timer expires, the target eNodeB discards any further data packet forwarding. Forwarding tunnels are then released.  For intra-RBS handover to be performed, the MME is not involved and no end marker packet is received. The source eNodeB continues to forward packets, while packets are received from the SGW and from the source eNodeB buffer containing data. When the timer expires, the target eNodeB discards any further data packet forwarding. Forwarding tunnels are then released.                             |

# 4 Network Impact of Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover

The Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature ensures that X2 intra-LTE handovers

are completed without downlink data packet loss.

Capacity and Performance

The Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature ensures that no downlink data

packet is lost during an X2 intra-LTE handover. This is achieved by the allocation

of forwarding user plane tunnels between the source and target eNodeBs during the

handover process. Data continuously flows with minimal TCP throughput degradation

and packet loss from the SGW to the UE through the source and target eNodeBs until

the handover is complete. Without the feature, loss of user data is possible and TCP

slow-start mechanisms can reduce the throughput. This particularly affects high-rate

users and users on the cell border experiencing a high number of handovers.

If the Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature is not activated, the packets

sent to the source node from the SGW during handover but not yet transmitted to the

UE are lost. If the feature is active on RLC AM DRBs, packets that are not

acknowledged by the UE are also lost. Packet loss causes a delay in the session,

leading to throughput reduction and can have a major effect on real-time

applications.

Data forwarding at intra-RBS handover is also supported by the Data Forwarding at

Intra-LTE Handover feature. This is achieved by internal functions, and therefore,

no external signaling is needed.

Packet forwarding also applies to the S1 handover. The S1 handover process is used

when the X2-based handover cannot be performed. It involves nodes operating under

the control of different MMEs. For more information about the S1 packet forwarding,

see Packet Forwarding at S1 Handover.

Handover

The Data Forwarding at Intra-LTE Handover feature can be used to ensure that data

rates remain high and no data is lost. Interruption time during handover is also

reduced.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports data forwarding at intra-LTE inter-capacity module

handover and RRC Connection Re-Establishment in intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module

cases. This reduces the downlink packet error loss rate during handovers if the

eNodeB is configured with multiple LTE capacity modules.

Capacity and Performance

If the eNodeB is configured with at least two LTE capacity modules, the packet loss

rate caused by handovers decreases in intra-eNodeB inter-capacity module cases.

Because of this, the value of the Average DL Packet Error Loss Rate KPI also

decreases. The decrease of the packet loss rate can be observed with the following

PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHoQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHoQci
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktFwdDl

Operation

With this feature enhancement, data forwarding is supported at intra-LTE

inter-capacity module handover and RRC Connection Re-Establishment in intra-eNodeB

inter-capacity module cases.

The feature enhancement also introduces the following changes to PM counters:

- The BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlCapUsedSum PM counter is deprecated and replaced by the BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlCapUsedSumMbps PM counter. The BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlCapUsedSumMbps PM counter is applicable and is accumulated on node level, but under only one instance of the BbProcessingResource MO class, even if two LTE capacity modules are configured.
- With this feature enhancement, the following PM counters are also applicable and are accumulated on node level, but under only one instance of the BbProcessingResource MO class, when two LTE capacity modules are configured: BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlCapUsedSamp BbProcessingResource.pmLicUlCapUsedSamp BbProcessingResource.pmLicUlCapUsedSum
- The BbProcessingResource.pmLicDlCapUsedMax and BbProcessingResource.pmLicUlCapUsedMax PM counters are only operational if the eNodeB is configured with one LTE capacity module.

The following PM events are affected:

- The EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_LIC\_DL\_CAP\_USED\_SUM event parameter of the INTERNAL\_PER\_CAP\_LICENSE\_UTIL\_REP PM event is deprecated and replaced by the EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_LIC\_DL\_CAP\_USED\_SUM\_MBPS event parameter.
- The EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_LIC\_DL\_CAP\_USED\_SUM event parameter of the INTERNAL\_PER\_UETR\_CAP\_LICENSE\_UTIL\_REP PM event is deprecated and replaced by the EVENT\_PARAM\_PER\_LIC\_DL\_CAP\_USED\_SUM\_MBPS event parameter.

Interfaces
