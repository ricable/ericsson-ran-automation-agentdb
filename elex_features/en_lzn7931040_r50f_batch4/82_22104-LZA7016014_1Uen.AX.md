Summary

The Maximum Cell Range feature supports for a maximum cell range of 100 km for FDD and 93 km

for TDD. Without this feature, the maximum cell range is 15 km. Large cells are

suitable to obtain coverage in sparsely populated areas where the need for capacity

is low. Examples of such areas are deserts, coastal areas, or sea environments.

# 3 Feature Operation of Maximum Cell Range

The main aspects of the operation of the Maximum Cell Range feature are PRACH preamble

format and RACH root sequence.

Operational Process

Both PRACH preamble format and RACH root sequence depend on setting the

EUtranCellFDD.cellRange or the

EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute. For more information, see

Deployment Guideline.

# 4 Network Impact of Maximum Cell Range

The Maximum Cell Range feature has an impact on UL capacity and maximum cell range. It

also limits the number of maximum possible cells in certain cases.

Capacity and Performance

UL capacity is reduced if additional UL resource blocks are reserved for random

access. This is needed if both of the following conditions are met:

- The Maximum Cell Range feature is activated.
- The cell range exceeds 15 km.

For more information, see Coverage and Capacity Dimensioning.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

This feature provides the LTE RAN with the functional possibility to carry traffic in

cells with the following maximum cell ranges defined by 3GPP:

- 100 km for FDD
- 93 km for TDD

This is only possible if the radio conditions are adequate.

# 7 Activate Maximum Cell Range

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010967 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Maximum Cell Range

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010967 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Maximum Cell Range

## 9.1 Configure Maximum Cell Range

The maximum cell range depends on deployment and subframe pattern.

Prerequisites

The Maximum Cell Range feature is activated.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.cellRange or EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute.

To set the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 15:

2. Set the EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment to 1.
3. Set the EUtranCellTDD.specialSubframePattern attribute to one of the following values:
    - 7 allows cell ranges 1-18. This setting provides the best downlink throughput. If using this value, setting the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 18 is rejected because of inconsistency between the specialSubframePattern and cellRange attributes.
    - 6 allows cell ranges 1-29. This setting provides a slightly reduced downlink throughput. If using this value, setting the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 29 is rejected because of inconsistency between the specialSubframePattern and cellRange attributes.
    - 5 allows cell ranges 1-93. This setting provides a significantly reduced downlink throughput. If using this value, setting the EUtranCellTDD.cellRange attribute higher than 93 is rejected because of inconsistency between the specialSubframePattern and cellRange attributes.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q1: LTE TDD Extended Range

This feature enhancement provides PRACH preamble format 0 for cell range beyond 15 km

on non-AAS and AAS radios. FWA network deployment is

recommended.

| Access Type:            | LTE                  |

Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to set subframe assignment 2 with

cell range beyond 15 km. This function provides increased downlink throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The recommended maximum cell range is up to 30 km but this can vary depending on

deployment and radio conditions. Beyond 30 km, the risk of PRACH performance

degradation can be detected. Compared to subframe assignment 1, PRACH performance

degradation also can be detected.

Operation

This feature enhancement updates the following attributes:

- EUtranCellTDD.cellRange
- EUtranCellTDD.subframeAssignment

The feature enhancement updates the Inconsistent

Configuration alarm with the following additional text:

- High Speed UE cannot be activated while maximum cell range is &gt;15km and parameter subframeAssignment is set to 2.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.4 is required for this feature enhancement.
