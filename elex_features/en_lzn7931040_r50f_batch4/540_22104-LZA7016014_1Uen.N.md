# 1 LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone Overview

This feature keeps an NR SA-capable UE in the LTE network for a configurable time period

after the UE performs an emergency

service.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |

Summary

This feature prevents an NR SA-capable UE from returning to the NR network after the UE

initiates an emergency call or emergency session. The feature keeps the UE in the

LTE network for a configurable time period after the emergency service begins. This

ensures that the PSAP can call back UEs faster after the emergency service.

The feature introduces an IE to support this function in the following cases:

- LTE handover
- RRC Re-establishment

The UE remains in the LTE network on the following conditions:

- The QoS of a QCI5 bearer changes to an ARP value for emergency
- QCI1 bearer release with an ARP level value for emergency
- QCI5 bearer establishment with an ARP level value for emergency
- Any UE payload activity over a QCI5 bearer with an ARP level value for emergency

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The feature is only applicable to NR Standalone-capable UEs.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone

This feature introduces an IE that enables the target eNodeB to calculate the remaining

inactivity time.

The Emergency Extension Time IE conveys the emergency inactivity time

extension for an NR Standalone-capable UE that performs handover in the source eNodeB

before the inactivity timer expires. This enables the target eNodeB to calculate the

remaining inactivity time.

The IE can be transmitted in a private extension over the following protocols:

- The X2AP protocol, from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB over the EAB in the following messages: UE Context Fetch Response HANDOVER REQUEST
- The S1AP protocol, within the EAB source eNodeB to the target Transparent Container Extension Conveyor of the eNodeB in the following messages: HANDOVER REQUIRED HANDOVER REQUEST

The UE remains in the LTE network on the following conditions:

- The QoS of a QCI5 bearer changes to an ARP value for emergency
- QCI1 bearer release with an ARP level value for emergency
- QCI5 bearer establishment with an ARP level value for emergency
- Any UE payload activity over a QCI5 bearer with an ARP level value for emergency

The feature initiates the following operations to keep NR Standalone-capable UEs in the

LTE network:

- The emergency inactivity timer extension is started.
- B1 NR standalone and B2 NR measurements are suspended.

If the emergency inactivity timer extension is active when any of the conditions are

fulfilled, the timer extension is restarted from the beginning. After the timer

extension expires, B1 NR Standalone and B2 NR measurements can

be configured again if any of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The QCI5 emergency ARP bearer is released.
- The QoS changes to a non-emergency ARP value.

The emergency inactivity timer extension is defined by the

Rcs.extendInactEmergency timer. The operation mode of the

emergency inactivity timer extension is defined by the

Rcs.extendInactEmMode attribute.

Handover can be performed to a target eNodeB that does not support the Emergency

Extension Time IE or the LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone

feature. In this case, the target eNodeB requests UE release if the UE inactivity time

exceeds the RRC Inactivity Timer settings for connected bearers.

LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone after QCI1 Bearer Release

The emergency inactivity timer extension begins after the release of the QCI1 bearer

with an ARP value for emergency. The emergency extension is added before the

inactivity time is calculated for NR Standalone-capable UEs if the LTE Emergency

Call Handling with NR Standalone feature is active.

If the LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone feature is not active, the

VoLTE Inactivity Timer Extension feature activates the timer extension.

Figure 1   QCI1 Bearer Release

Emergency Inactivity Timer Extension for QCI5 Bearer Establishment or

Modification

The emergency inactivity timer extension is initiated in the following cases:

- The QCI5 bearer is established with an ARP value for emergency.
- The QoS of a QCI5 bearer changes to an ARP value for emergency.

The emergency inactivity timer extension is applicable for NR Standalone-capable UEs

if the LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone feature is active.

If the timer extension is activated, B1 NR standalone and B2

NR measurements are suspended until it expires.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Emergency Call Handling with NR Standalone

This feature can increase the number of NR SA-capable UEs connected to the LTE

network. This can cause the eNodeB to reach the maximum number of connected UEs more

quickly.

Capacity and Performance

The feature can increase the number of NR SA-capable UEs connected to the LTE

network, because it maintains LTE connection after an emergency call. This also

means that the eNodeB can reach the maximum number of connected UEs more quickly in

the following cases:

- A high number of NR SA-capable UEs initiate emergency calls
- Emergency sessions are initiated in the LTE network when traffic is high

In such cases, the Admission Control feature can trigger.

Interfaces

The feature introduces the Emergency Extension Time IE. The IE can be

transmitted in a private extension over the following protocols:

- The X2AP protocol, from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB over the EAB in the following messages: UE Context Fetch Response HANDOVER REQUEST
- The S1AP protocol, within the EAB source eNodeB to the target Transparent Container Extension Conveyor of the eNodeB in the following messages: HANDOVER REQUIRED HANDOVER REQUEST

Other Network Elements

No impact.
