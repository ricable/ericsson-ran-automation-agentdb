# 1 Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance Package Overview

The feature improves UE coverage and

capacity by introducing multi-antenna transmission modes to the LTE RAN

downlink.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

Activating the feature with two transmit antennas in downlink can result in major improvements

in coverage and capacity.

The feature operates with the following transmission modes:

- TXD transmission mode
- OLSM transmission mode
- CLSM transmission mode

With the TXD transmission mode, the cell coverage and the cell-edge throughput increases for

low SINR users. This improvement can be beneficial in large cells.

With large delay CDD used in the OLSM or CLSM transmission modes, high SINR users experience

higher peak throughputs. This improvement can be beneficial, for example, in small

cells with optimal tilts. In addition, CLSM provides higher peak throughputs than

OLSM in the low to medium-high SINR regions.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The feature requires the cell to be

configured with two transmit antennas. When only one transmit antenna is available or

more than one transmit antenna is without a valid license, the UE is configured with a

single antenna port.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The feature introduces multi-antenna

transmission modes to the LTE RAN downlink. When a UE is selected for scheduling, downlink

assignments are generated and allocated to Layer 1 processing units based on UE reports and

the transmission mode.

Multi-Antenna Transmission Mode Schemes

The feature introduces the following 3GPP multi-antenna transmission modes to the LTE

RAN downlink:

- TXD
- OLSM
- CLSM

The TXD mode uses an Alamouti (space-frequency block code) scheme in the frequency

domain to transmit one code word on two antennas. The TXD mode is always rank 1 and

does not enhance the data rates in itself. The benefit of using the TXD mode is that

it provides a better SINR at the UE side.

The OLSM and the CLSM modes support rank 1 and rank 2 transmissions. The rank 1 form

of the OLSM and the CLSM is equivalent to the TXD. The rank 2 form uses a large

delay CDD transmission or CLSM scheme to transmit two code words on two antennas by

using spatial multiplexing. When the conditions are fulfilled, spatial multiplexing

enhances the data rates of the transmission.

To optimize radio resource use, the LTE OLSM and CSLM modes enable the adaptive

selection of the multi-antenna scheme with the most suitable properties.

For lower SINR, transmit diversity is the best multi-antenna scheme. For higher SINR,

the UE benefits from using spatial multiplexing.

Figure 1   Adaptive Spatial Multiplexing

To adaptively switch the rank of the transmission in OLSM or CLSM transmission mode,

CSI is necessary on the transmitter side. In LTE, the UE estimates the signal

quality and determines the most suitable rank for the transmission.

Information about the signal quality and the preferred rank is sent to the RBS in CQI

reports and RIs. If TXD mode is used, the RIs are not transmitted because the rank

is set to 1. The PMI is available only for CLSM mode. The PMI is unnecessary for

OLSM mode because large delay CDD is used.

UE Reports

The UE is requested to provide periodic CSI with different contents and frequency

depending on the transmission mode. The transmission mode and contents of the CSI

reporting is set through RRC signaling. The following options are available:

- If the transmission mode is set to TXD, the UE reports CQI.
- If the transmission mode is set to OLSM, the UE reports CQI and RIs.
- If the transmission mode is set to CLSM, the UE reports CQI, RIs, and PMI.

Operational Process

Figure 2   Downlink Scheduling and Layer 1 Processing

The process steps of downlink assignment generation and allocation are the

following:

1. When a UE is selected for scheduling, a DCI format is selected. Table 2 Supported DCI Format Types Transmission Mode DCI Format Format Characteristics TXD DCI format 1 The format supports transmission on only one code word. The format supports resource allocations of type 0 bitmap allocations. OLSM DCI format 2A The format supports transmission on one or two code words. The format supports resource allocations of type 0 bitmap allocations. CLSM DCI format 2
2. The UE is assigned a candidate set of PRBs based on the resource allocation types for the DCI format. The following data serve as input to the link adaptation function: The assigned set of PRB resources The preferred number of code words The number of bits for transmission
3. The link adaptation tracks the RI feedback provided by the UE. Two transport blocks are allocated if the latest RI feedback is two and the scheduler indicates that transmission on two code words is possible. The transport format for the transmission and the required set of PRB resources are determined based on the channel measurements. The channel measurements are provided by the UE in CQI reports and the available number of bits.
4. After reception, the UE feedback separates the HARQ acknowledgements for each transmitted code word to optimize the use of the radio resource.
5. When the scheduler process is completed, the result is a set of downlink assignments that is provided as input to the Layer 1 processing unit. The process for each downlink assignment differs depending on the number of code words used.
    1. With one code word, Layer 1 processing uses the TXD transmission mode, that involves layer mapping and precoding for transmit diversity.
    2. With two code words, Layer 1 processing uses large delay CDD or CLSM transmission mode, that involves layer mapping for spatial multiplexing and precoding.
6. After mapping code words to layers and precoding, the output is two sequences of complex valued symbols. These symbols are mapped to resource elements for transmission on antenna ports 0 and 1.

# 4 Network Impact of Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance Package

The feature improves

cell capacity and cell coverage.

Capacity and Performance

The feature increases the cell capacity. The user rate is increased at cell edge

using the TXD scheme and at high SINR using the large delay CDD or CLSM scheme.

Cell coverage is increased by the use of TXD scheme available in both transmission

modes. This enables an increase of SINR, which allows users to maintain sessions at

higher path loss from the RBS.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

This enhancement to the Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance Package highly improves coverage and

capacity.

Capacity and Performance

Cell Capacity is increased by implementing this feature. This is evident through the higher

user rates at cell edge using the TXD scheme and at high SINR using the CLSM

scheme.

Cell coverage is increased by the use of the available TXD scheme. This enables an increase of

SINR, which allows users to maintain sessions at higher path loss from the RBS.

TM4 provides higher peak throughputs than TM3 in the low SINR region. In good SINR

region, TM4 shows similar performance as TM3. TM3 shows gain over TM4 under high

mobility condition.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The enhancement has an impact on two RRC IEs:

- transmissionMode
- codebookSubsetRestriction

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
