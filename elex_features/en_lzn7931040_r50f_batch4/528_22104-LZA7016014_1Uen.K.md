Summary

The Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature enables the

prioritization of mobile-terminating access requests during high load. When this

feature is activated, the mobile-terminating access requests are accepted or

rejected based on the paging priority included in the S1AP paging message and the

current admission control threshold. This threshold is defined by the Dynamic UE

Admission Control feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

This feature does not support the following UE types:

- NB-IoT UEs
- Category M1 UEs
- UEs with eDRX

The feature does not support paging with IMSI.

Network Requirements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required for this feature.

The MME must assign and provide the appropriate paging priority to the eNodeB in the

S1 PAGING message.

# 3 Feature Operation of Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

If this feature is activated, the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature considers the

paging priority of the mobile-terminating access requests in the admission control

decisions.

This feature introduces the following admission thresholds:

These thresholds must be configured for this feature to operate.

The mobile-terminating access requests are placed in three pools according to their

paging priority, which is included in the S1 PAGING message, and the thresholds

introduced by this feature. These pools are mapped to the different thresholds of the

Dynamic UE Admission Control feature. As a result, the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature considers the paging priority as input for the admission control decisions of

mobile-terminating access requests.

Figure 1 shows how the feature operates to

include the mobile-terminating access requests in the admission control function.

Figure 1   Operational Process

Process Steps

1. An S1 PAGING message is received.
2. The feature checks the following requirements: Note: If any of the listed conditions is not fulfilled, the execution continues as stated in the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature description.
    1. The feature is activated, and there is at least one active cell where one of the paging priority thresholds is set to different value than OFF.
    2. The received paging is not for a Category M1, NB-IoT, or eDRX UE.
    3. The ID in the S1 PAGING message is S-TMSI.
    4. The Paging Priority IE is included in the S1 PAGING message.
    5. The received paging priority is equal or higher than the active paging priority, which is the lowest priority defined with the two introduced paging priority thresholds among all active cells.
3. The eNode sends the UE the RRC PAGING message.
4. The eNodeB stores the paging priority using the S-TMSI as a key.
5. When an RRCConnectionRequest message with the establishmentCause IE set to mt-Access is received, the eNodeB checks the paging priority for Admission Control.
6. The eNodeB retrieves the paging priority using the S-TMSI as the key.Note: If the S-TMSI is not found in the stored paging priority entries, the RRC connection request is treated as a non-prioritized service.
7. The mobile-terminating access request is admitted or rejected based on the paging priority received in the S1 PAGING message and the paging priority threshold of the cell.

## 3.1 Mobile Terminating Access Handling with Dynamic UE Admission Control

If the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature is activated, the

mobile-terminating access requests are included in the admission control

function.

Figure 2 shows the relation between the

thresholds of the Dynamic UE Admission Control feature and the thresholds introduced by

the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature.

Figure 2   Admission Policy with Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

The Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

feature introduces the following paging priority thresholds:

These thresholds are mapped to the thresholds in the Dynamic UE Admission Control

feature. If the load in the cell is above the differentiating threshold of the Dynamic

UE Admission Control feature, only mobile-terminating access requests with a priority

that is equal to or higher than the differentiating paging priority threshold are

accepted. If the load is above the overload threshold of the Dynamic UE Admission

Control feature, only mobile-terminating access requests with a riority that is equal to

or higher than the overload paging priority threshold are accepted.

## 3.2 Mobile Terminating Access Handling with Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access

When the Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is

activated, the privileged mobile-terminating access requests can be rejected during high

load.

When the Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load feature is activated, the

mobile-terminating access requests with a paging priority that is equal to or higher

than the overload paging priority threshold are privileged access requests. This

threshold is configured with the

EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute. If the

Enhanced Dynamic UE Admission Control for Privileged Access feature is activated and the

load in the cell is above the privileged access overload threshold, all the privileged

mobile-terminating access requests are rejected.

Figure 3 shows how the privileged access

admission control function is related to the admission control decisions of

mobile-terminating access requests.

# 4 Network Impact of Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

This feature affects the performance during high load.

Capacity and Performance

This feature dynamically reserves resources for mobile-terminating access requests

with paging priority based on the admission control thresholds during high load.

This ensures stable node performance for mobile-terminating access requests with

paging priority at high load.

During high traffic load on the eNodeB, the following impacts can be observed:

- The mobile-terminating access requests with overload paging priority are more successful than mobile-terminating access requests with low paging priority, or no paging priority.
- The mobile-terminating access requests with differentiation paging priority are more successful than mobile-terminating access requests with low paging priority, or no paging priority.
- The Initial E-RAB Establishment Success Rate per QCI KPI increases slightly if any of the MSR use levels is above the differentiation threshold.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Prioritized Mobile Terminating Access at High Load

To fully benefit from this feature, the recommendations must be considered when

configuring the paging priority thresholds.

Configuration of the Paging Priority Thresholds

To include the mobile-terminating access requests in the

admission control decisions, the thresholds introduced by the Prioritized Mobile

Terminating Access at High Load feature must be configured.

The following configurations are recommended:

- For the overload paging priority threshold, the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityOverloadThr attribute is configured to the value that is assigned as the paging priority to the privileged access mobile-terminating calls by the MME.
- For the differentiating paging priority threshold, the EUtranCellFDD.pagingPriorityDiffThr or the EUtranCellTDD.pagingPriorityDiffThr attribute is configured to the value that is assigned as the paging priority to the mobile-terminating VoLTE calls by the MME.
