Summary

The Differentiated Admission Control feature provides higher accessibility for UEs

and E-RABs with high Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP). The feature also

enables optional SPID priority by prioritizing UEs and bearers over each other

during admission control. The following access-differentiation algorithms are

supported:

- Differentiated blocking
- Preemption

The two algorithms can be activated together to achieve higher differentiation

effect.

Through differentiated blocking, higher accessibility is achieved for UEs and E-RABs

with high ARP at the cost of lower accessibility for UEs and E-RABs with low ARP.

The same is also applied for UEs with high SPID priority, if the SPID-based

filtering is activated.

Through differentiation by preemption, higher retainability is achieved for UEs and

E-RABs with high ARP at the cost of lower retainability for UEs and E-RABs with low

ARP or, optionally, low SPID priority.

When both differentiation algorithms are activated together, the cost in lower

retainability might be traded for the cost in lower accessibility for UEs and E-RABs

with low ARP.

Affected System Functions

Dynamic GBR Admission Control requires different

configuration of admission thresholds. This depends on if the Differentiated

Admission Control feature is activated or not.

# 3 Feature Operation of Differentiated Admission Control

When Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated, the eNodeB prioritizes UEs and E-RABs against each other in admission control.

Prioritization is based on the service Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) configured

in the core network, and optionally, SPID of UEs. As a result, UEs and E-RABs with

higher configured ARP priority or having prioritized SPID get higher accessibility to

E-UTRAN.

Two different algorithms are supported to achieve higher accessibility for UE and E-RAB

requests with high ARP priority: differentiated blocking and pre-emption. The two

algorithms can be activated together to achieve higher differentiation effect. The

pre-emption algorithm also applies to SPID-based prioritization.

Without the Differentiated Admission Control feature, any resource shortage in the cell

leads to rejection of the resource request regardless of ARP, unless the resource

request is classified as privileged access by Admission Control. With the Differentiated

Admission Control feature, resource shortage leads to a controllable prioritization

between new resource requests and already admitted users using the full granularity of

the ARP range, and the list of least prioritized SPIDs.

Differentiated Blocking

When differentiated blocking is activated, a resource margin is reserved for UEs and

E-RABs, which are considered high priority at that time period. When utilization for

a monitored system resource reaches this margin, new incoming UE and E-RAB requests

considered as low priority at that time period are denied access to the system. The

blocking ARP priority level is set dynamically so that the UEs and bearers with low

ARP priority are allowed to increase their resource share if the resource share for

UEs and bearers with high ARP priority is low.

If SPID-based filtering is activated, high priority SPID users are admitted

regardless of their ARP value.

Pre-emption

When pre-emption is activated, previously admitted active UEs or E-RABs can be

pre-empted in case of resource congestion. This allows new high priority UEs or

bearers to enter the system. Pre-emption can be based on ARP priority and optionally

on SPID of UEs.

Simultaneous Use of Differentiated Blocking and Pre-emption

When both differentiated blocking and ARP-based pre-emption are activated together, a

UE or E-RAB request is rejected because differentiated blocking can still get access

to the system by pre-empting active UEs or E-RABs with even lower ARP priority. This

allows higher differentiation effect.

## 3.1 ARP Differentiation in Admission Control

The Differentiated Admission Control feature operates when the RBS receives a resource

request, for example, at initial access, E-RAB setup, and incoming handover, and there is a

resource shortage. Resource shortage can be on connection level or bearer level resources.

Resource shortage can occur because of any reason such as license limits, hardware and

software limits, or admission control functions such as the Admission Control and the Dynamic GBR Admission Control features.

Depending on the considered resources, admission control and access differentiation are

performed on the following levels:

- UE context admission (includes RRC connection setup and Initial Context setup)
- Radio bearer admission

When the Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated, differentiation is performed

by default for UE context resources and transport network GBR bearer bandwidth resources,

considered in basic Admission Control. Differentiation for bearer radio interface resources in admission

control for GBR bearers is also supported. This requires that the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is active.

### 3.1.1 Differentiation at Initial Access

Operation sequence for ARP differentiation at initial access is shown in Figure 1.

When the Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated, only the number of RRC

connected users for each eNodeB is considered for ARP differentiation at initial

access.

Both differentiated blocking and pre-emption are supported for this operation sequence.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Differentiated Admission Control feature receives an RRC connection setup request in the RBS.
2. Basic admission control is performed for incoming RRC connection request, based on UE resources.
3. If the UE passes the basic admission control conditions, the Differentiated Admission Control feature allows the setup of RRC connection.
4. The Differentiated Admission Control feature receives Initial Context Setup Request from the MME.
5. The Differentiated Admission Control feature initiates ARP differentiation.
    - If the differentiation algorithms result in admittance, the Differentiated Admission control feature allows initial context setup.
    - If the differentiation algorithms result in rejection, Initial Context Setup Failure is transmitted to the MME, and the RRC connection is released by the RBS.

While ARP values are configured per bearer, it is necessary for ARP differentiation

to assign an ARP value to each UE.  ARP value for a UE is defined as the highest

requested ARP priority over all DRBs of that UE.

### 3.1.2 Differentiation at E-RAB Setup

When a UE context is successfully admitted after receiving Initial Context Setup

Request from the MME, bearer admission control is performed for each E-RAB

request received in the message. The operational sequence for bearer admission control for

each E-RAB request is shown in Figure 2.

Differentiation at E-RAB setup requires that the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is active.

Operational Process

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Differentiated Admission Control feature receives an E-RAB setup request in the RBS.
2. Basic admission control is performed for incoming E-RAB connection request, based on bearer resources.
3. If the E-RAB is rejected by the basic Transport Network admission control conditions, the Differentiated Admission Control feature initiates differentiation by pre-emption. For more information, see Transport Network Admission Control in Admission Control and Pre-emption for Accumulated Transport Network Bandwidth for GBR Bearers.
4. If the E-RAB passes the differentiated admission control conditions, the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature initiates admission control. The admission control is based on air interface resources for GBR bearers.
5. If the E-RAB passes the Dynamic GBR Admission Control conditions, the Differentiated Admission Control feature performs admission control. The admission control is based on radio resources for GBR bearers.
    - If the differentiation algorithms result in admittance, the Differentiated Admission Control feature allows E-RAB setup.
    - If the differentiation algorithms result in rejection at any point, the Differentiated Admission Control feature rejects E-RAB setup.

## 3.2 Differentiated Blocking

Differentiated blocking is the default differentiation algorithm when the Differentiated

Admission Control feature is activated. It can be deactivated by configuring the

differentiation margins for all resources equal to zero.

To achieve higher accessibility for bearer requests with high ARP priority level,

differentiated blocking introduces the following admission thresholds for each monitored

system resource:

- Differentiation threshold
- Overload threshold

Differentiation threshold is an admission threshold applied for UE and E-RAB setup requests

considered as low priority. Overload threshold is applied for requests considered as high

priority.

The decision about which ARP values are considered high-priority and low-priority is

dynamically taken at each resource usage measurement period. When the monitored resource usage

changes, an ARP value called ARP blocking level sets the boundary between high-priority and

low-priority ARP values for the next measurement period. The first goal of this dynamic

differentiation algorithm is to guarantee access priority to the services with high ARP

values. The second goal is to allow the highest possible accessibility for the services with

low ARP values if the resource consumption of high priority services is low.

Admission policy for differentiated blocking is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Admission Policy with Two Admission Thresholds

At each new bearer request, the ARP priority of the request is compared to ARP blocking

level. After the comparison, the request is classified as high or low priority. Then the total

resource use is compared to the differentiation threshold and to the overload threshold. All

requests are admitted if the total resource use is lower than the differentiation threshold.

Only requests with higher priority than ARP blocking level are admitted if the total resource

use is higher than the differentiation threshold but lower than the overload threshold. All

non-privileged requests are blocked if the total resource use is higher than the overload

threshold.

If the Differentiated Admission Control feature is activated together with Dynamic GBR

Admission Control and Enhanced PTT Admission Control features, differentiated blocking is

performed based on the dynamic load for each ARP level at GBR bearer setup request. The

feature considers PTT load reservations in downlink for each ARP and calculates the ARP

blocking level.

## 3.3 Differentiation by Pre-emption

When pre-emption is activated, previously admitted active UEs or E-RABs can be

pre-empted if there is resource congestion. This allows that new high priority UEs or bearers

enter the system.

Figure 4   Pre-emption Functions

### 3.3.1 Early UE Pre-emption

To allow that new UEs connect to a cell if there is a resource shortage on UE or bearer

level for non-GBR E-RABs, early UE pre-emption is attempted. This requires that the pre-emption

function of the Differentiated Admission Control feature is enabled by setting the parameter

AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState to

ACTIVATED.

Before any pre-emption based on Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP), early UE pre-emption

can be applied to release allocated but unused resources. UEs are eligible for early UE

pre-emption when the UEs are inactive for longer than the value of the

AdmissionControl.preemptInactTimerMin attribute. This attribute enables

the operator to set UE inactive period until it becomes eligible for pre-emption. In order to

have eligible UEs for early UE pre-emption, values of

AdmissionControl.preemptInactTimerMin attribute must be lower than

Rcs.tInactivityTimer attribute.

No ARP setting of the admitted UEs is considered when searching for UEs eligible for early UE

pre-emption. UEs are not eligible for early UE pre-emption and SPID-based early UE pre-emption

when a DRB with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute set to

MC\_SIGNALING is present on the UE.

SPID-Based Early UE Pre-emption

If SPID-based early UE pre-emption is enabled and configured, the Differentiated Admission

Control feature selects the inactive UE that is pre-empted. The selection is based on the

SPID of the candidate UE requesting admission, and the SPID of the UEs served in the

cell.

This requires that the pre-emption function of Differentiated Admission Control feature is

enabled by setting the parameter AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState

to ACTIVATED.

Otherwise, an arbitrary UE is selected for pre-emption that fulfills the                       conditions. |

S1AP Release Cause Codes

In case of UE release due to pre-emption, eNodeB triggers a release procedure toward the MME for one of the following reasons:

- To enable release of the UE-associated logical S1-connection
- To enable MME to initiate the appropriate release procedure on the core network side

To be able to identify the reason for the UE release, the cause code release-due-to-pre-emption is used.

### 3.3.2 UE Pre-emption

To allow new UEs to connect to a cell if there is a resource shortage on UE level, UE

pre-emption is attempted, if enabled. This pre-empts UEs with lower priority than the UE

requesting connection.

UE pre-emption requires that the pre-emption function of the Differentiated Admission Control

feature is enabled, by setting the attribute of the parameter

AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState to

ACTIVATED.

If there is a resource shortage on connection level when the node receives a resource

request, a search is started for a UE to be pre-empted. The target UE for this action has to

be of lower priority than in the request. Resource requests can be received at

RRC Connection Request or Handover

Request over the following interfaces:

- Uu
- S1
- X2

This is described in the following standards:

- 3GPP TS 36.331
- 3GPP TS 36.413
- 3GPP TS 36.423

If the search for a UE to be pre-empted is successful, it is pre-empted and an extra resource

request is allowed. Otherwise, the resource request is rejected.

The following principles apply to find UEs to be pre-empted (a candidate UE is a UE that

would like to pre-empt other served UEs):

- A candidate UE can only pre-empt a served UE if any E-RABs of the candidate UEs have the ARP IE Pre-emption Capability set to may trigger pre-emption.
- Before any ARP-based pre-emption, the early UE pre-emption procedure is executed to find inactive resources to be pre-empted.
- A candidate UE can only pre-empt a served UE that has the ARP IE Pre-emption Vulnerability of all its E-RABs set to pre-emptable.
- A candidate UE can only pre-empt a served UE if the E-RAB of the served UE with the lowest Priority Level value is higher than the lowest Priority Level value of the E-RAB of the candidate UE. For example, if the highest priority bearer of the candidate UE has higher priority than the highest priority bearer of the served UE.

SPID-Based UE Pre-emption

If SPID-based UE pre-emption is enabled and configured, the Differentiated Admission

Control feature selects the UE that is pre-empted. The selection is based on the SPID of the

candidate UE requesting admission and the SPID of the UEs served in the cell.

Otherwise, ARP-based UE pre-emption is in use to find served UEs to be                       pre-empted. The selection of the UE to be pre-empted is based on the ARP                       priority of the candidate UE and the served UE. |

Preventive UE Pre-emption

Preventive UE pre-emption is initiated by the Baseband unit before a resource shortage

based on the connection level. The connection level is calculated by the Baseband unit as

the number of admitted UEs and SCells configured by the Carrier Aggregation feature.

The threshold for activating preventive UE pre-emption is the beginning of the privileged

access pool, which is the number of active cells multiplied by the value of the

AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell attribute. If the

threshold is reached, the Baseband unit informs the Radio Access Control layer and the UE

that requests connection becomes a candidate for pre-emption.

The preventive UE pre-emption flow continues similarly to UE pre-emption, but the candidate

UE is kept in the system even if pre-emption is not successful.

If a UE meets the criteria for both UE pre-emption and preventive UE pre-emption, UE

pre-emption is executed.

S1AP Release Cause Codes

In case of UE release due to pre-emption, eNodeB triggers a release procedure toward the MME for one of the following reasons:

- To enable release of the UE-associated logical S1-connection
- To enable MME to initiate the appropriate release procedure on the core network side

To be able to identify the reason for the UE release, the cause code release-due-to-pre-emption is used.

Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users

If the Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access Users feature is active, UE resource

pre-emption mechanism is triggered if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

- There are no SR resources in the system.
- The candidate UE is a PA user.

UE preemption ensures availability of SR resources for additional incoming PA

users.

During preemption, PA users use SR resource from the SR resources pool reserved for PA

users.

Pool reserved for PA users can consist of one or both of the dedicated pools which reserve

resources on cell level:

- Preallocated pool
- Limitation pool

For more information, see the Advanced SR Allocation for Privileged Access

Users document.

### 3.3.3 Bearer Pre-emption

To allow new E-RABs resources in a cell if there is a resource shortage on bearer

level, bearer pre-emption is attempted, if enabled. This pre-empts bearers with lower priority

than the bearer requesting connection.

Bearer pre-emption requires that the pre-emption function of the Differentiated Admission

Control feature is enabled by setting attribute

AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState to

ACTIVATED.

If there is a resource shortage on bearer level when the node receives a resource request, a

search is started for an E-RAB to be pre-empted. The target E-RAB for this action has to be of

lower priority than the request. Resource requests can be received over the S1 or X2 interface

at the following events:

- Initial Context Setup Request
- E-RAB Setup Request
- E-RAB Modify Request
- Handover Request

This is described in the following standards:

- 3GPP TS 36.413
- 3GPP TS 36.423

If the search for an E-RAB to be pre-empted is successful, it is pre-empted and an extra

resource request is allowed. Otherwise, the resource request is rejected.

The following principles apply to find E-RABs to be pre-empted (a candidate E-RAB is an E-RAB

that would like to pre-empt other served E-RABs):

- A candidate E-RAB can only trigger pre-emption if the corresponding ARP IE Pre-emption Capability is set to may trigger pre-emption.
- For candidate E-RABs of resource type non-GBR, the procedure early UE pre-emption is executed to find inactive resources to be pre-empt before any ARP-based pre-emption is initiated.
- A candidate E-RAB can only pre-empt E-RABs with Pre-emption Vulnerability set to pre-emptable.
- The selection of E-RABs to be pre-empted starts with the least prioritized E-RABs, until the Differentiated Admission Control feature finds sufficient resources. After that, the Differentiated Admission Control feature checks (in the order from the most prioritized E-RAB to the least prioritized) if any bearer is selected for pre-emption.
- If the resource shortage corresponds to scheduler-handled MSR such as defined in Dynamic GBR Admission Control, only one E-RAB with resource type GBR is selected for pre-emption.
- If the resource shortage corresponds to accumulated values of E-RAB GBR of admitted E-RABs representing transport network admission control (see Admission Control), multiple E-RABs can be pre-empted.
- The Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature enables incoming privileged access GBR bearers to trigger pre-emption or rejection during the overload of dynamic GBR load in downlink.

SPID-Based Bearer Pre-emption

If SPID-based bearer pre-emption is enabled and configured, the Differentiated Admission

Control feature selects the E-RAB that is pre-empted. The selection is based on the SPID of

the candidate UE requesting admission and the SPID of the UEs served in the cell.

### 3.3.4 Pre-emption Search Algorithm

Generally, the pre-emption procedures defined in this document only pre-empt resources within

the cell of the UE requesting resources. This applies regardless of whether the resource

shortage occurs on node or cell level.

Moreover, the search for resources to pre-empt also exclude the following:

- UEs currently involved in triggering the pre-emption of resources (as a consequence there is no pre-emption of resources within the UE requesting resources).
- UEs with ongoing E-RAB establishments.

### 3.3.5 Pre-emption for Accumulated Transport Network Bandwidth for GBR Bearers

If pre-emption is activated, a GBR bearer request rejected by Transport Network Admission

Control can be still admitted by pre-empting active GBR bearers with lower ARP priority. For

more information, see Transport Network Admission Control in Admission Control.

The transport network bandwidth is configured using the

AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth and the

AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth parameters.

The admission thresholds are defined by the AdmissionControl.dlNonPaGbrTn

and the AdmissionControl.ulNonPaGbrTn parameters.

## 3.4 Handling of Privileged Access Requests

Privileged access is a part of basic admission control that provides an access guarantee to

emergency calls and services with high priority access. Requests for privileged access

connections and E-RABs are not rejected by differentiated blocking, not even by

differentiation threshold or overload threshold. They can trigger pre-emption if it is

activated. See Admission Control for more details on privileged access.

If the Enhanced PTT Admission Control feature is active, the following applies for PA GBR

bearer setups:

- PA GBR bearer setup requests are able to trigger bearer pre-emption if the dynamic GBR load in downlink is above the overload threshold and if pre-emption is turned on.
- PA GBR bearer requests are rejected if no candidates for pre-emption can be found or pre-emption is not enabled.

# 4 Network Impact of Differentiated Admission Control

The Differentiated Admission Control feature increases accessibility for UEs and E-RABs

with high APR priority.

Capacity and Performance

Accessibility is increased for UEs and E-RABs with high ARP priority.

When pre-emption is activated, retainability is decreased for UEs and E-RABs with low

ARP priority.

When differentiated blocking is activated, accessibility is decreased for UEs and

E-RABs with low ARP priority.

When SPID-based pre-emption is used in addition to ARP-based pre-emption, the

following applies:

The following KPIs are increased for UEs and bearers with prioritized SPID:

- Initial E-RAB Establishment Success Rate
- Added E-RAB Establishment Success Rate
- UE Initial Context Setup Establishment Success Rate

Retainability is degraded for UEs and bearers with the least prioritized SPID.

Mobility

High priority UEs and E-RABs have higher mobility success rate with differentiated

admission control.

Interface Impact

The release due to pre-emption cause code is used to identify the reason for the UE or

bearer release.

# 5 Parameters for Differentiated Admission Control

The Differentiated Admission Control feature introduces new MOM attributes for

configuring differentiated blocking and SPID-based

pre-emption.

# 6 Performance of Differentiated Admission Control

The Differentiated Admission Control feature is associated with performance management

entities measuring accessibility, retainability, and

mobility.

KPIs

The table lists the main Key Performance Indicators associated with the feature, and

the expected impact.

Table 6   Key Performance Indicators

| KPI           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accessibility | Accessibility is increased for UEs and E-RABs with high ARP                                     priority.  Because of this, an increase in metrics is                                 expected.                                    |
| Retainability | When pre-emption is activated, retainability is decreased for UEs                                     and E-RABs with low ARP priority. Because of this, a decrease in                                     metrics is expected.    |
| Mobility      | High priority UEs and E-RABs have higher mobility success rate                                     with differentiated admission control. Because of this, an                                     increase in metrics is expected. |

# 7 Activate Differentiated Admission Control

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- Core network is configured to differentiate the following ARP IEs for E-RABs: ARP Priority level Pre-emption vulnerability Pre-emption capability Note: ARP Priority level 15 means "no priority", hence the given values for the Pre-emption Capability IE and Pre-emption Vulnerability IE are not considered. Instead, the values "shall not trigger pre-emption" and "not pre-emptable" prevail. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.413.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011062 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Differentiated Admission Control

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011062 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Differentiated Admission Control

The operator can adjust threshold values, configure differentiated blocking, and

SPID-based pre-emption.

Threshold Adjustment

Adjusting thresholds for the Differentiated Admission Control feature is done with

the following parameters for dynamic MSRs:

- AdmissionControl.dlAdmOverloadThr
- AdmissionControl.ulAdmOverloadThr
- AdmissionControl.dlAdmDifferentiationThr

Adjusting thresholds for the Differentiated Admission Control feature is done with

the following parameters for static MSRs:

- AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell
- AdmissionControl.admNrRrcDifferentiationThr

Configuration of Differentiated Blocking

Differentiated blocking can be deactivated by setting the differentiation margin to

zero for all monitored resources. This is done by setting the differentiation

threshold and the overload threshold to the same value. The overload threshold and

the differentiation threshold for number of RRC connected users considered in basic

admission control is configured as follows:

- Overload threshold for number of RCC connected users is given by C − (AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell × n), where C is licensed capacity, AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell is a configurable parameter and n is number of cells.
- The differentiation threshold is configured with the parameter AdmissionControl.admNrRrcDifferentiationThr, as a ratio of overload threshold.
- Differentiation Thresholds for downlink and uplink radio interface resources considered in Dynamic GBR Admission Control are configured by the parameters AdmissionControl.dlAdmDifferentiationThr and AdmissionControl.ulAdmDifferentiationThr. Overload thresholds are configured by the parameters AdmissionControl.dlAdmOverloadThr and AdmissionControl.ulAdmOverloadThr.

Configuration of SPID-based Pre-emption

SPID-based pre-emption on each level (early UE pre-emption, UE pre-emption, bearer

pre-emption) requires the following configuration:

1. Set the parameter AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState to ACTIVATED to enable the pre-emption function of the Differentiated Admission Control feature.
2. Set the parameter AdmissionControl.diffAdmCtrlFilteringEnabled to TRUE.
3. Create DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile MO instances as desired.
4. Configure the parameter DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile.firstPreEmptionSpidSet to define SPIDs with lower priority for pre-emption.
5. Configure the parameter EUtranCellFDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef or EUtranCellTDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef to refer to a DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile MO instance.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q3: Enhanced S1AP Pre-emption Observability

The enhancement enables the operator to identify the reason for which the UE or

bearer release is

due.

| Feature Name:           | Differentiated Admission Control   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1787 R6                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0409 R4                    |
| Node Type:              | Radio Access Network               |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the following pmCounters

to count the

number of UE or E-RAB releases due

to pre-emption:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPe
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPe
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbActPe
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbActPe
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexErabRelAbnormalEnbActPe
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexErabRelAbnormalEnbActPe

The feature

enhancement introduces the release-due-to-pre-emption cause code to count the reason

of the UE or bearer

release.

Interfaces

This change affects the S1AP interface, where the new information element type

release-due-to-pre-emption

has been added to the Cause information element.

Hardware

All except DUL 20.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- MME
- SGW
- PGW

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q1: SPID-based Differentiated Admission Control

The

feature enhancement allows the configuration of SPID-based pre-emption, and Differentiated

Blocking to enable the operator to differentiate between user treatments on

admission.

| Feature Name:           | Differentiated Admission Control   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1787                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0409                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement enables the operator to differentiate between user treatments on

admission, based on SPID when Differentiated Blocking is triggered. When SPID-based

pre-emption is enabled and configured, selection of candidates for pre-emption is first

made based on SPID, and then on Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP). All high

priority SPID users are admitted, while low priority SPID users are admitted based on

their Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).

Capacity and Performance

The following KPIs are increased for UEs and bearers with prioritized SPID:

- Initial E-RAB Establishment Success Rate
- Added E-RAB Establishment Success Rate
- UE Initial Context Setup Establishment Success Rate

For UEs and bearers with least prioritized SPID, Retainability is degraded.

Operation

The following new MO attributes are introduced by the enhancement:

- AdmissionControl.diffAdmCtrlFilteringEnabled
- DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile.firstPreEmptionSpidSet
- EUtranCellFDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef
- EUtranCellTDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef

Differentiated Blocking Enhancement, and SPID-based Pre-emption are enabled when the

following is true:

- The SPID-based filtering is enabled by setting the AdmissionControl.diffAdmCtrlFilteringEnabled MO attribute to TRUE.
- The reference is set to DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile from cell attribute EUtranCellFDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef or EutranCellTDD.diffAdmCtrlFilteringProfRef.
- The DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile.firstPreEmptionSpidSet is set to an SPID value.

When the enhancement is enabled, high priority SPID UEs are admitted into the system,

regardless of their ARP value. Low priority SPID UEs still follow admission criteria

based on their ARP values, so UEs with high priority ARPs are admitted (while UEs

with low priority ARPs are rejected) into the system.

The non-prioritized SPIDs are configured in the

DiffAdmCtrlFilteringProfile.firstPreEmptionSpidSet MO

attribute.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

This enhancement requires ENM version 18.10 or later to be used.

## Appendix A.c: 20.Q2: Early UE Preemption Enhancement

The feature enhancement provides control for Differentiated Admission Control

preemption with the possibility to configure a new inactivity timer.

| Feature Name:           | Differentiated Admission Control   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1787                       |
| Value Package Name:     | Differentiated Mobile Broadband    |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0409                       |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

Benefits

The enhancement provides improved functionality and flexibility for early UE

preemption by allowing for the possibility to configure UE inactivity.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the

AdmissionControl.preemptInactTimerMin attribute. This enables

the operator to set the UE inactive period until it becomes eligible for

preemption.

Early UE preemption can increase the

EUtranCellFDD.pmErabRelAbnormalEnbPe or

EUtranCellTDD.pmErabRelAbnormalEnbPe PM counters. In this

way, an increased number of UEs with higher Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP)

can be released and benefits of this enhancement can be observed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.2 or later is required for this enhancement.
