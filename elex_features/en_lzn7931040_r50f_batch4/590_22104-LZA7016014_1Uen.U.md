or both can be boosted for Msg2 as needed. The maximum boosted power is

configurable.

The feature has the following benefits:

- Improved random access success rate
- Improved handover success rate because of higher CFRA success rates

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Flexible Power Boost for Initial Access

This feature provides configurable Msg2 power boosting to improve random access

success rate and handover execution success rate.

Figure 1   Operation of the LTE Flexible Power Boost for Initial Access Feature

If the Timing Advance (TA) value measured by the eNodeB is equal to or greater than the

value of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2TaThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2TaThr attribute, Msg2 power boosting

is triggered for the selected UEs.

PDCCH transmission power or PDSCH transmission power, or both can be boosted through the

following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch
- EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch
- EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch
- EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch

If power boosting fails, Msg2 is not scheduled for the UE. In this case, no subsequent

random access procedure is performed.

## 3.1 Configure LTE Flexible Power Boost for Initial Access

The values of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch attributes depend on the

following aspects:

- The cell bandwidth
- The PHICH resource
- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchCfiMode or the EUtranCellTDD.pdcchCfiMode attribute

Table 2 shows the recommended maximum settings

of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch or the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch attributes.

Table 2   Recommended Maximum Settings (Unit: 0.1 dB)

|   CFI | 1.4 MHz   | 3 MHz   | 5 MHz   |   10 MHz |   15 MHz |   20 MHz |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
|     1 | N/A       | N/A     | N/A     |        0 |       15 |       30 |
|     2 | N/A       | 0       | 0       |       30 |       30 |       30 |
|     3 | N/A       | 0       | 25(1)   |       30 |       30 |       30 |

(1)

The maximum setting of the

EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch

and the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch

attributes for 5MHz and CFI 3 can be 30.

It is recommended to set the same value for the maximum setting of the

EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch and the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdsch attributes as the maximum

setting for the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch

attribute and the value of the EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch

attribute.

Setting the values of the EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch or the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2Pdcch attributes too high might lead

to insufficient resources and random access failure which might result in Msg2

transmission failure.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Flexible Power Boost for Initial Access

This feature might decrease cell throughput and UE throughput.

Capacity and Performance

Cell throughput and UE throughput might decrease because random access Msg2 power

boost uses part of the available bandwidth. The decrease is higher in conditions

with low bandwidth and high traffic load.

The negative impact can be reduced by increasing the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2TaThr or the

EUtranCellTDD.pwrBoostRaMsg2TaThr attribute.

In high-load conditions,

CCE

utilization without Msg2 power boost might be higher because

PDCCH allocation might be successful due to low power consumption requirements.

However, in this configuration the success rate of Msg2 is lower because the

transmission power of Msg2 is insufficient.

If the boosted power is too high, it might lead to insufficient resources and random

access failure.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
