Summary

The Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation feature is based

on the Carrier Aggregation feature and supports the following functions:

- A cell used as a PCell can have more than one SCell candidates.
- An SCell candidate can be added or deleted without the need to lock and unlock the cell for the change to take effect.
- Based on L3 measurements and through the SCell selection algorithm, the SCell of a UE is dynamically configured or deconfigured.
- When the number of component carriers is decided, it is not considered whether the UE can support a lower subset of band combinations. Therefore, there is more opportunity for a configuration with a higher number of component carriers.
- The SCell selection is bandwidth- and layer-aware using effective bandwidth evaluation.
- After successful SCell configuration, any SCell deconfiguration attempt is prevented if it leads to an unsupported UE capability or non-standard carrier aggregation band combination.

# 3 Feature Operation of Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation

This section contains the feature operation process steps for Dynamic SCell Selection

for Carrier Aggregation.

Figure 1   Sequence Diagram of Dynamic SCell Selection

Process Steps

1. Capabilities and any supported Carrier Aggregation band and bandwidth combinations are reported in recently connected UEs and those handed over from other cells. Only UEs capable of Carrier Aggregation are considered for SCell selection for Carrier Aggregation.
2. Initial SCell blind selection is handled. Note: If initial SCell blind selection runs after any of the CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForCaOpportunity or CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForAdditionalSCellOpportunity timers is expired, it functions as if CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION. No other setting of CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode takes effect in that case. In case all SCells candidates are removed by the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature during an active voice bearer service, the SCell blind selection to configure SCell is triggered again when the voice bearer is released.
    1. If not built previously, the UE-specific SCell candidate list is built. The list contains the intersection of the node cells configured as SCell candidates and the UE supported Carrier Aggregation band combinations. If the list is empty, no Carrier Aggregation is attempted for this UE until the next connection occurs. Note: If the Shared LTE RAN feature is enabled, the following attributes are checked before considering the addition of SCell candidates to the frequency relation: EUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList EUtranCellFDD.activePlmnList or EUtranCellTDD.activePlmnList SCell configuration is only available to UEs that have PLMN IDs in both of the following lists: Allowed PLMN list of the corresponding frequency Active PLMN list of the SCell If the relevant EUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList is empty, the frequency relation and its respective cell relations are all allowed, and therefore considered as possible SCell candidates for UEs belonging to any PLMN. If the EUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList contains at least one PLMN, the frequency relation and its respective cell relations are allowed and considered as possible SCell candidates only for UEs that have at least one of the listed PLMN Ids, if HRL is available. In this case the node also checks the UE equivalent PLMN Ids. When HRL is not present, there are no restrictions on the SCell selection. If the PCell uses TM7, SCell candidate list is empty.
    2. If the High Power UE feature is enabled, and attribute EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability is set to PRIORITIZE\_IN\_CA, the SCell candidate list for high power UEs is modified in the following way: If attribute EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability is set to NO\_PRIORITIZATION, the node dynamically switches between carrier aggregation and high power UE support. Dynamic switching is based on time normalized filtered uplink SINR measurements for DMRS, and controlled by the following MOs: EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger In bad radio conditions-when the uplink SINR is lower than EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres - EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst for at least a time of EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger-the node switches to support high power UE capability. The process is the same as when attribute EUtranCellTDD.prioHpueCapability is set to PRIORITIZE\_IN\_CA. In good radio conditions-when the uplink SINR is higher than EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchThres + EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchHyst + the power value determined by the power class of the UE for at least a time of EUtranCellTDD.hpueCaSwitchTimeToTrigger-the node switches to uplink carrier aggregation mode. All component carriers are deconfigured and the SCell selection process is started without supporting high power UE capabilities.
        - If the UE is not capable of simultaneous high power and uplink carrier aggregation, the uplink component carrier is removed from SCell candidates.
        - Only such Downlink SCell combinations are selected that allow the preservation of high-power capability.
        - When the UE operates on band 41 in the PCell, inter-band SCells are excluded from the initial UE-specific SCell candidate list, to preserve high power UE capability while providing sufficient Downlink throughput for the UE on band 41.
    3. If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled and a voice bearer request is received over the S1 or X2 interface at Initial Context Setup, Incoming Handover, or RRC Connection Re-establishment withserviceType=VOIP, the SCell candidate list for the UE is removed or modified depending on the following values of the attributeEUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or TDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall:
        - If the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to DECONF\_SCELLS, all SCell candidates are removed during a VoLTE call.
        - If the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to DECONF\_UL\_SUPPRESS\_DL\_SCELLS, the following apply during a VoLTE call: SCell selection does not start at VoIP bearer setup. Measurements of the SCell are deleted to avoid later SCell configuration or deconfiguration. UL component carriers are deconfigured.
        - If the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to DECONF\_UL\_SCELLS, UL SCell candidate is changed to DL SCell and the SCells with DL only and no UL for the UE are configured.
    4. The MFBI additional bands are considered at every step of the SCell candidate selection algorithm, if the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to one of the following values: UN\_ACK\_SIMUTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION This means that SCell evaluation continues until the most preferable SCell candidate is found using all possible band combinations including MFBI additional bands. This provides more opportunity to configure higher order Carrier Aggregation component carrier.
    5. One or more SCell candidates enabled from the SCell candidate list are selected in a sequence. While the selection is done, the node does not consider if lower subsets of carrier band combinations is supported by the UE. For example, when the UE is capable of 3CC Carrier Aggregation with P as PCell, S1 and S2 as SCells, but it does not support the combination P and S1, or P and S2, the UE is still configured for 3CC Carrier Aggregation with P, S1 and S2. If there are no enabled SCell candidates in the list, go to Step 9.
        - Only one SCell can be selected if CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is set to ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION.
        - Multiple SCells can be selected if CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to one of the following values: UN\_ACK\_SIMUTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION
        - If the node receives a frequency in the MBMSInterestIndication message from an MBMS on SCell capable UE (mbms-SCell-r11 = 1, 3GPP 36.331) and no SCell has already been configured with that frequency, SCells with the MBMSInterestIndication frequency (if any) are prioritized when selecting from the candidate list.
    6. SCell selection priority can be used to determine which SCell is preferred when selecting an SCell to be configured. The prioritization is enabled by setting the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute to indicate cell overlap. The SCell priority is based on what type of overlap the cells have. The priority order is as follows where the default value 0 means that no prioritization applies: To use the attribute EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator with value 1 (COVERS) for SCell selection prioritization without also enabling blind handover, blind handover must be manually disabled by setting the attribute EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed to false. Otherwise blind handover becomes enabled for the cells where attribute EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator is set to value 1 (COVERS). This is done by setting the attribute EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed to false.
        - 1 (COVERS)
        - 2 (OVERLAP)
        - 3 (CONTAINED\_IN)
        - 0 (NONE)
    7. The potential effective bandwidth evaluation is triggered if the CarrierAggregationFunction.enhancedSelectionOfMimoAndCa attribute is set to true and the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to one of the following values: UN\_ACK\_SIMUTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION
    8. Before the set of SCells selected during the Dynamic SCell Selection are configured on the UE, the node checks the following for all the possible subsets: Bandwidth MIMO capability The setup of CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference which controls if uplink CA can be removed or not. The node matches these with the bandwidth combinations supported by the UE to get the best combination of the SCells (either all or a subset of the selected set) that provides with the best potential effective bandwidth.
        - In the scenario where the number of configured SCells is less than the number of selected SCells, the SCells chosen for configuration are the ones that result in the highest value of effective bandwidth.
        - When the evaluation results in two or more subsets with the same effective bandwidth, the subset selection preference is controlled by the value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.fourLayerMimoPreferred attribute.
3. The selected SCells and the following event measurements are configured. Whether configure A1 or not depends on the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute. A1 is configured for each SCell if the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to one of the following values: ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION A1 is not configured if the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to the following value: UN\_ACK\_SIMUTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION Since this mode assumes that SCells are in good coverage, avoiding the configuration of A1 helps to reduce RRC overhead. A2 is always configured for each downlink SCell. The configuration of A2 for the uplink SCells depends on the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute. Table 2 Downlink and uplink SCell Handling Based on Selection Mode sCellSelectionMode Measurement Downlink and uplink Handling UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION A1Bidir and A2Bidir not configured Downlink and uplink parts can only be deconfigured together. ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION A1Bidir and A2Bidir configured Downlink and uplink parts can be deconfigured both separately and together. If there is more than one SCell candidate on the same frequency for this UE, A6 is configured for each SCell. SCells are allowed to be configured only if the number of UEs capable of Carrier Aggregation does not exceed CarrierAggregationFunction.caUsageLimit and the number of connected users does not exceed a predetermined threshold based on CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold. Otherwise Carrier Aggregation for this UE is terminated until the next connection occurs.
4. UE coverage is checked in the configured SCells. If coverage is good, go to Step 5. If coverage is poor, go to Step 7. An SCell is considered to have good coverage if any of the following conditions apply: If the timer CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRep expires without reception of a message indicating good coverage (A1 or A6), the SCell is considered to be out of coverage. Go to Step 7. Note: The timer CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRep that is the timer value while waiting for a confirmation of a blind SCell selection is calculated by the following formula: CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRep = CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRepLessTtt + timeToTrigger where: timeToTrigger = max (timeToTriggerA1, timeToTriggerA6) The CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRepLessTtt attribute is used to determine the value of timer CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRep.
    - The CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to UN\_ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION. If the UE supports more component carriers than configured and the SCell candidate list is not empty, go to Step 9.
    - The UE reports A1 measurement on the SCell if the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode attribute is set to the following values: ACK\_SEQUENTIAL\_SCELL\_SELECTION ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION
    - The UE reports A6 measurement on the SCell, where the reported L3 measurements meet the A1 trigger parameter condition. Note: During the handling of the A2 measurement, the A6 timer is not triggered if either of the following cases is true: The UE does not support handling an A6 measurement. It is not possible to get A6 measurement based on the node configuration.
5. For each configured SCell, it is checked whether the SCell is good. It is checked how the SCell entered this state. The node handles the SCell depending on what type of event triggered its state. Table 3 Triggering Condition Description A1 triggered The current SCell is kept and the A1 measurement is removed. If the UE supports more component carrier an additional SCell is selected. Go to Step 8. A6 triggered Go to Step 6. A1 from ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir is triggered The SCell is deconfigured, and configured again with uplink Carrier Aggregation added, return to Step 5. A2 from ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir is triggered The SCell is deconfigured, and configured again without uplink Carrier Aggregation, return to Step 5. Note: The uplink component carrier can be deconfigured without the possibility of unsupported Carrier Aggregation band combinations. Because the maximum component carriers in uplink are two, so any deconfiguration of one component carrier cannot lead to unsupported or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination.
6. A6 measurement is handled.
    1. If A6 is triggered by its reported L3 measurements that meet the trigger condition of A1 and the reported cell is an SCell candidate, the current SCell is deconfigured, and the SCell reported by the A6 measurement is configured. As a result, both A2 and A6 are configured.
    2. If A6 is triggered by its reported L3 measurements, which are below the threshold to trigger A1, and the reported cell is an SCell candidate, then go to Step 7.
    3. If A6 is triggered, but the reported cell is not an SCell candidate:
        - If the CarrierAggerationFunction.a6TriggerSCellDeconfig is set to true, then go to Step 7.
        - If the CarrierAggerationFunction.a6TriggerSCellDeconfig is set to false, then the current SCell is not deconfigured, and the A6 report is ignored.
7. The current SCell is deconfigured if any of the following applies: In case the SCell is configured with missing subset of band combinations that leads to unsupported UE capability or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination, the SCell has an opportunity to be deconfigured in the following cases:
    - The SCell is not good from Step 4.
    - The SCell is A2 triggered while in Step 5, and the deconfiguration of the SCell does not lead to unsupported UE capability or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination.
    - The SCell is A6 triggered without replacement of new SCell, so considered not good in Step 6, and the deconfiguration of the SCell does not lead to unsupported UE capability or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination.
    - The SCell is disabled while in Step 5. No measurement report (A2 or A6) is received. (LAA SCell is not applicable.)
    - If the VoLTE Optimized Carrier Aggregation feature is enabled and a voice bearer request is received at E-RAB Setup with serviceType=VOIP, the SCell is deconfigured depending on the following values of the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall: If the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to DECONF\_SCELLS, all SCells which have been configured for the UE and measurements related to CA and SCells are deconfigured during a VoLTE call. If the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to DECONF\_UL\_SUPPRESS\_DL\_SCELLS, SCell selection does not start at VoIP bearer setup, Measurement events of SCell are deleted to avoid later SCell configuration or deconfiguration, UL component carriers are deconfigured. If the attribute EUtranCellFDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall or EUtranCellTDD.sCellHandlingAtVolteCall is set to DECONF\_UL\_SCELLS, UL SCell which has been configured for the UE and measurement related to UL CA and SCell are deconfigured. In this case, DL in the SCell is kept.
    - When the UE connection is released.
    - When the node receives a repeated A2 or A6 message, if deconfiguring the SCell does not lead to unsupported UE capability or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination any more, the SCell can be deconfigured. This happens, for example, when another SCell has been normally deconfigured before this repeated A2 or A6 measurement. Note: If the timer CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRep is running, it is not stopped for the SCell when the node receives the A2 or A6 message.
    - When the SCell is considered to be out of coverage because the timer CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRep expires without reception of a message indicating good coverage (A1 or A6), and deconfiguring the SCell is prevented to avoid unsupported UE capability or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination, the timer is started again. At the next timer expiration, if deconfiguring the SCell does not lead to an unsupported UE capability or non-standard Carrier Aggregation band combination any more, the SCell can be deconfigured. This happens, for example, when another SCell has been normally deconfigured before this next timer expiration.
8. SCell re-selection during normal operation. The SCell candidate list built in Step 2 is used. If the list is empty, no Carrier Aggregation is attempted for this UE until next connection. Otherwise it is checked if all the SCell candidates on the list have been configured once in the current iteration of SCell selection.
    1. If not, the next SCell candidate not configured is selected. Go to Step 3.
    2. If yes, go to Step 9.
9. Timer for the next Carrier Aggregation opportunity. The CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForAdditionalSCellOpportunity timer is started to wait for the next Carrier Aggregation opportunity, or the CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForCaOpportunity timer if there are no configured SCells. Note: The timer is restarted as long as highest supported number of component carriers is not configured for the UE and the SCell candidate list is not empty.

## 3.1 PCell-Only Configuration during Initial Context Setup

The PCell-only configuration during initial context setup function allows sending the

PCell and SCell configuration information in separate

RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages.

This function can be enabled using the

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPCellOnlyInitialSetup attribute and

is only effective during initial connection establishment. The UE handover and RRC

connection reestablishment processes are not affected.

Figure 2   Process of PCell-Only Configuration during Initial Context Setup

The PCell-only configuration during initial context setup function has the following

process steps:

1. The initial RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is sent with only the PCell configuration information.
2. Initial SCell evaluation is triggered after the first successful RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message is received.
3. The SCell configuration information is sent in multiple RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages (sequential SCell selection) or one RRCConnectionReconfiguration message (simultaneous SCell selection).

PCell-only configuration information reduces the initial

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message size for carrier

aggregation-capable UEs, which improves the initial context setup time for these UEs.

However, using additional RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages increases

the RRC signaling and the overall UE setup time.

# 4 Network Impact

Capacity and Performance

The Main Processor loading can be increased due to an RRC message load increase

introduced in this feature. In particular, when a cell abruptly loses its RF power,

either due to cell lock, or antenna failure, or both, an RRC message storm can occur

if the cell is configured as an SCell that serves many UEs.

This feature is expected to improve network coverage. The Carrier Aggregation

coverage area is expected to be improved for multiple SCell candidates in comparison

with network coverage for a single SCell candidate.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation

caUsageLimit

It is recommended not to limit SCell connections using the attribute

CarrierAggregationFunction.caUsageLimit, so that it is set to the

largest permitted value. Instead, resources can be controlled using

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold.

caPreemptionThreshold

The attribute CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold

configures the resource consumption margin in percentage, beyond which SCells should not be

configured. If any increase in pmCaConfiguredNoMeasAtt -

pmCaConfiguredNoMeasSucc is observed, the value of

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreemptionThreshold can be reduced from

the default 50%, while monitoring for a decrease in accessibility and handover success.

sCellSelectionMode

The attribute CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode is

recommended to be configured considering the PCell-SCell coverage relationship in different

Carrier Aggregation deployment scenarios (see 3GPP 36.300 J.1 for typical Carrier

Aggregation deployment scenarios).

Table 6   Configuration Guidelines for sCellSelectionMode

For more information about CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode

configuration in 3CC Carrier Aggregation, 4CC Carrier Aggregation, 5CC Carrier Aggregation,

see 3CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension, 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension, and 5CC DL Carrier Aggregation Extension respectively.

waitForCaOpportunity

The value of the timer CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForCaOpportunity

can be tuned to achieve a compromise between RRC overhead and how fast a UE is configured

with a proper SCell. A larger value reduces the RRC messages generated by UEs which are out

of coverage of any SCell candidates, including disabled SCell candidates. A smaller value

ensures that a UE that moves into the coverage of an SCell (or a proper SCell becomes

available) is configured with the SCell faster.

waitForAdditionalSCellOpportunity

The value of the timer

CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForAdditionalSCellOpportunity can be

tuned to achieve a compromise between RRC overhead and how fast a UE is configured with an

additional SCell. A larger value reduces the RRC messages generated by UEs which are out of

coverage of any SCell candidates, including disabled SCell candidates. A smaller value

ensures that a UE that moves into the coverage of an additional SCell (or an additional

SCell becomes available) is configured with the SCell faster.

a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir

The ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir threshold is used to

trigger the removal or configuration of the uplink aspect of an SCell. The uplink aspect is

removed when the RSRP falls below the following configured value:

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir -

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.hysteresisA1A2RsrpBidirectional

The uplink aspect is configured in addition to the downlink direction when the RSRP is

above the following configured value:

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrpBidir +

ReportConfigSCellA1A2.hysteresisA1A2RsrpBidirectional

For guidelines, see Uplink Carrier Aggregation.

a1a2ThresholdRsrp

The ReportConfigSCellA1A2.a1a2ThresholdRsrp threshold is closely related

to the activation and deactivation threshold

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres. For example, for 2Tx

rank 2 with noise only scenario, the a1a2ThresholdRsrp is set to

sCellScheduleSinrThres - 126 or lower, to avoid deconfiguring the SCell

while it is still activated.

The guidelines for setting a1a2ThresholdRsrp is based on the following

principles:

- An SCell should not be deconfigured while it is still activated.
- When an SCell is deactivated due to poor channel conditions, the SCell should be deconfigured to free up resources.

There are, however, situations that warrant setting the threshold

a1a2ThresholdRsrp differently. For example, if there is only one SCell

candidate in the deployment and the cell load is low, then an SCell should not be

deconfigured while it is still activated. So a1a2ThresholdRsrp can be set

to a very low value to avoid deconfiguring the SCell when the UE is out of coverage. This

reduces RRC signalling and the SCell can quickly be reactivated when the RF condition is

improved.

waitForBlindSelSCellRepLessTtt

The attribute CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRepLessTtt

is used to determine the timer value while waiting for a confirmation of a blind SCell

selection and can be configured in a way to prevent the unnecessary deconfiguration of a

good SCell.

sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset

When the ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package feature is active,

the operator can configure differentiated SCell activation and deactivation threshold

for the UEs in subscriber groups by using the

SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset

attribute.

If the

SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute is

configured, the threshold for the UEs in a subscriber group is the sum of the following

attributes:

- CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres
- SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset

For the UEs that are not in the subscriber group, the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres attribute

determines the SCell activation and deactivation threshold.

| Value of the                                     SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset                                 Attribute   | SCell SINR Threshold for the UEs in the Subscriber Group        | Effects on Downlink Spectral Efficiency   | Effects on Downlink Throughput                                |

| Negative(3)                                                                                                                                      | Lower than for other UEs which are not in the subscriber group  | Decreases                                 | Increases                                                     |

(1)

This configuration reduces the SCell use in poor coverage

cells.

(2)

In high load, the higher offset configuration allows

more SCell resources with low spectral efficiency to

be available for other

UEs.

(3)

In poor coverage, it is not recommended to configure a

negative offset value because it decreases spectral

efficiency.

## 9.3 Potential Effective Bandwidth Evaluation

The effective bandwidth evaluation algorithm, when enabled, runs right after either the

prioritized or round robin dynamic SCell selection. This functionality is only supported

on the simultaneous SCell selection modes.

Before the set of SCells selected during the Dynamic SCell

Selection are configured on the UE, the node checks the following for

all the possible subsets:

- Bandwidth
- MIMO capability
- The setup of CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference which controls if uplink CA can be removed or not.

The node matches these with the bandwidth combinations supported by

the UE to get the best combination of the SCells (either all or a subset

of the selected set) that provides with the best potential effective

bandwidth.

The potential effective bandwidth evaluation is triggered

if the

CarrierAggregationFunction.enhancedSelectionOfMimoAndCa

attribute is set to true and the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellSelectionMode

attribute is set to one of the following values:

- UN\_ACK\_SIMUTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION
- ACK\_SIMULTANEOUS\_SCELL\_SELECTION

This enhancement to the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier

Aggregation feature provides the possibility to configure the timer value

while waiting for a confirmation of a blind SCell selection. It is possible to configure

the timer value to wait for SCell good coverage measurement report. The timer can be

configured in a way to prevent the unnecessary deconfiguration of a good SCell. As a

result, this offers a positive impact on UE throughput.

The timer waitForBlindSelSCellRep to wait for SCell good coverage measurement report can be

configured by the operator using the

CarrierAggregationFunction.waitForBlindSelSCellRepLessTtt

attribute.

## Appendix A.f: 19.Q2: Effective Bandwidth Evaluation Enhancement for SCell Selection

The effective bandwidth evaluation functionality is enhanced and added to the Dynamic

SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation feature.

The functionality evaluates all the possible subsets of the initial selected Carrier

Aggregation (CA) band combination set. If one of the subsets for the initial selected CA

band combination set has the highest potential effective bandwidth, the subset is

selected as a final band combination.

The evaluation is enhanced to consider

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPreference to control if uplink CA

can be removed or not to provide the highest effective downlink bandwidth. This enables

the use of the highest effective downlink bandwidth if it is on a band combination

without uplink CA support.

This functionality can be activated for the Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier

Aggregation and the Configurable SCell Priority features.

Capacity and Performance

Activating the effective bandwidth evaluation increases downlink throughput for the

network.

Operation

The effective bandwidth evaluation functionality is controlled by the

CarrierAggregationFunction.enhancedSelectionOfMimoAndCa

attribute.

This enhancement introduces PM counters and updates PM events to measure the causes of

SCell configuration and deconfiguration. For enhanced observability, these new counters

are on cell relation level instead of cell level, and therefore provided as OSS

counters.

A new RBS PM counter is added to measure how many times a UE triggers the additional CA

opportunity timer. This new counter is accumulated on the PCell.

## Appendix A.h: 19.Q3: Enhancement for A6 triggered SCell Deconfiguration

The enhancement improves the carrier aggregation SCell selection and reselection

process to handle Event A6 UE measurement based SCell deconfiguration in a more optimal way.

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3063                                      |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation                               |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405                                      |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node                |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                               |

The enhancement permits the operators to enable or disable A6 triggered SCell

deconfiguration in intra-eNodeB and inter-eNodeB when reported cell in the received A6

measurement report is not a valid Carrier Aggregation candidate. As a result, the

throughput of the downlink and the end user service in carrier aggregation deployments

are improved.

When it is set to true, SCell deconfiguration reduces load between

eNodeBs in inter-eNodeB scene, but UE throughput decreases. When it is set to

false, SCell deconfiguration helps to avoid unnecessary SCell

deconfiguration which improves UE throughput and reduces RRC signaling.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This enhancement introduces the

CarrierAggregationFunction.a6TriggerSCellDeconfig

attribute.

## Appendix A.i: 19.Q3: Improved Carrier Aggregation SCell Selection Process

This enhancement improves the carrier aggregation SCell selection process and speeds

it up.

The enhancement has the following benefits:

- Higher uplink and downlink UE throughput
- Decreased CPU load
- Improved accessibility and retainability

Capacity and Performance

The improved carrier aggregation SCell selection allows the UE to connect to the most

suitable set of available SCells. This results in higher uplink and downlink UE

throughput.

Improved carrier aggregation SCell selection also decreases the CPU load. Since the

exact benefit depends on multiple factors, it cannot be predicted in general. The

benefit depends on the following factors:

- Site configuration
- Traffic load
- Capabilities of the connected UEs

LTE UE event report handling is improved, resulting in simpler and faster

reconfiguration.

During A2 event handling, A6 is sent if the UE supports it (UE Capability Information

is checked) and if there is possible sCell candidate on the same frequency. As there

is not wait time for the A6 event, sCell reconfiguration is faster.

The eNodeB reacts to changes in the radio conditions quicker and more accurately.

This improves accessibility and retainability by securing that the UEs use the best

radio resources.

## Appendix A.j: 21.Q3: PCell-Only Configuration during Initial Context Setup

This feature enhancement improves the initial context setup time for carrier

aggregation-capable UEs by splitting the configuration of PCell and SCells in separate

RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages.

| Feature Name:           | Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3063                                      |
| Value Package Name:     | Carrier Aggregation                               |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0405                                      |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                               |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                               |

Benefits

This feature enhancement improves initial context setup time for carrier

aggregation-capable UEs.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement reduces the initial

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message size. The reduced message

size improves processing time.

Operation

This feature enhancement allows splitting the configuration of PCell and SCells in

separate RRCConnectionReconfiguration messages. The initial

RRCConnectionReconfiguration message includes only the PCell

configuration, and the SCell configuration is sent in the next message.

This feature enhancement introduces the

CarrierAggregationFunction.caPCellOnlyInitialSetup attribute,

which can be used to enable PCell-only configuration during initial context

setup.

Hardware

No hardware dependencies.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
