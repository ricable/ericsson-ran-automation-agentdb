Summary

This feature allows for the automatic adjustment of the uplink RLC retransmission

threshold in congested cells to reduce uplink RLC buffer use.

When a single cell uses more than the allowed percentage of total RLC buffer

capacity, the uplink RLC retransmission threshold is automatically lowered to reduce

congestion. If RLC buffer use drops, the uplink RLC retransmission threshold is

returned to the original value.

Additional Information

For information on the preferred state and parameter settings

of this feature, see RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.

# 2 Dependencies of LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

This feature has no dependencies to other features.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

This feature adjusts the threshold for uplink RLC retransmission in congested cells when

the total uplink RLC buffer use is high.

Configuration of Cell Congestion Detection

This feature introduces the

RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferCellThresUlMaxRetx attribute.

This attribute is used to configure the maximum percentage of the total uplink RLC

buffer capacity that can be used by a single cell before the cell is considered

congested.

When this percentage of total uplink RLC buffer capacity is reached by a single cell,

that cell is considered congested and the feature is activated for it.

Configuration of Uplink RLC Buffer Thresholds

This feature introduces attributes to define percentages of total uplink RLC buffer

that can be used by a single cell to control feature operation. The percentages

specify when the feature adjusts the uplink RLC retransmission threshold in

congested cells.

The feature can be controlled with the following attributes:

- RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresHigh When total uplink RLC buffer use surpasses the threshold defined by this attribute, all congested cells use the congested uplink RLC maximum retransmission threshold for all new connections in the node.
- RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresLow When total uplink RLC buffer use drops below the threshold defined by this attribute, all cells, including the previously congested ones, use the regular uplink RLC maximum retransmission threshold for all new connections in the node.

Configuration of Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

The number of allowed uplink RLC retransmissions is defined by the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute.

This feature introduces the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow

attribute to allow adjusting the threshold for congested cells. If the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is set to the

same value as the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute,

the feature does not function in the node.

Operational Process of LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

1. Uplink RLC buffer use surpasses the percentage defined by the RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresHigh attribute. If the uplink RLC buffer used by a cell surpasses the percentage defined by the RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferCellThresUlMaxRetx attribute, the cell is considered congested.
2. The value of the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is applied to new connections in cells that are considered congested, instead of the value defined by the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute.
3. Uplink RLC buffer use drops below the percentage defined by the RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresLow attribute to prevent oscillation.
4. The value of the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute is applied to new connections in previously congested cells.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

This feature can reduce uplink RLC buffer use and the severity of uplink RLC buffer

congestion caused by UEs in bad radio conditions.

Capacity and Performance

This feature allows for reducing uplink RLC buffer use by UEs in bad radio

conditions, which can result in less throughput degradation for UEs in good radio

conditions.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| RlcConfiguration.ulRlcBufferMaxRetxThresLow    | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

This feature is associated with a counter for measuring the number of DRBs configured

with the regular and the congested uplink RLC maximum retransmission threshold.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature introduces the

RlcConfiguration.pmRlcUlMaxRetxThrAdapt PM counter. The PM

counter is used to observe the number of DRBs in E-RAB setups that are configured

with the regular and the congested uplink RLC maximum retransmission threshold. The

PM counter is stepped during E-RAB setups in congested cells and in cells not

affected by the feature.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012687 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012687 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LTE Load-Based Uplink RLC Retransmission Threshold

The DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is used to

limit the number of uplink RLC retransmissions in congested cells.

This feature can be used with the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute set to the

default value, or a non-default value. The default value of the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is

8.

The DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute must be set to the

same value, or a value less than the value of the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute. If the value of the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is equal to the

value of the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute, this

feature is not operational in the node.

During the software update for this feature, if the value of the

DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute is less than the

default value of the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute,

the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is set to the

same value as the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute.

Otherwise, the DataRadioBearer.ulMaxRetxThresholdLow attribute is set

to the default value of 8.
