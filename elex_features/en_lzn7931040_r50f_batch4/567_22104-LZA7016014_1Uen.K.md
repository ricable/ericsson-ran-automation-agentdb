Summary

The VoLTE Prescheduling feature sends an uplink prescheduling grant to UEs with voice

bearers.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Reduced uplink packet loss
- Improved VoLTE quality
- Reduced VoLTE jitter variation

To fully benefit from the feature, UEs with VoLTE or PTT voice bearers must belong to

one ASGH group.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature does not support NB-IoT UEs and Category M1 UEs.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version 22.10 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of VoLTE Prescheduling

The feature enables prescheduling for UEs

with voice bearers during connection setup.

Operational Process

The feature is enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.voltePreschedulingEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.voltePreschedulingEnabled attribute to

TRUE.

This feature operates on the cell level.

Without prescheduling, if the UE with voice bearers fails to decode the uplink grant

on PDCCH, 8 ms is needed in FDD for the eNodeB to send a new uplink grant. By

enabling VoLTE prescheduling, the UE with voice bearers can get the new uplink grant

faster.

VoLTE Prescheduling is expected to improve the packet loss performance and the VoLTE

quality in low to moderate load. The heavier the load, the smaller the VoLTE quality

improvement.

To configure a suitable set of prescheduling parameters for VoLTE and PTT users,

creating a separate ASGH group is recommended for UEs with voice bearers. This

configuration mitigates the decrease of uplink throughput and the increase of uplink

interference.

# 4 Network Impact of VoLTE Prescheduling

The feature improves

the integrity of the network.

Capacity and Performance

The feature has the following benefits:

- Reduced uplink packet loss
- Improved VoLTE quality
- Reduced VoLTE jitter variation

The heavier the load, the smaller the VoLTE quality improvement.

The uplink throughput can decrease, and the uplink interference can increase.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for VoLTE Prescheduling

It is suggested to create a separate ASGH group for VoLTE and PTT users, as the

recommended prescheduling configuration is different for VoLTE and non-VoLTE UEs.

The following recommended prescheduling parameter configuration of the dedicated ASGH

group for VoLTE and PTT users can alleviate the possible negative effect on uplink cell

throughput and uplink interference. The recommended prescheduling configuration is

different for VoLTE and non-VoLTE UEs.

| PreschedProfile.preschedulingPeriod         |                   5 | The smaller the value of the                                     PreschedProfile.preschedulingPeriod                                 attribute, the more frequent the scheduling, and the better the                                 effect of the prescheduling. In case of smaller attribute value the                                 prescheduling uses more system resources. The higher the value, the                                 more sparse the scheduling, and the worse the effect of the                                 prescheduling. In case of higher attribute value the prescheduling                                 uses less system resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
