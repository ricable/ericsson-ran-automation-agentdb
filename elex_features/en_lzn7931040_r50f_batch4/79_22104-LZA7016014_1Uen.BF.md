# 3 Feature Operation of Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load

This feature monitors the PUCCH resource use in a cell, and automatically configures a

parameter to reduce PUCCH resource consumption in high load.

When the use level exceeds the threshold, an operator-controlled value is used for the

Time Alignment Timer (TAT). This forces the UEs to go out of synchronization after the TAT is

expired. When the use level is below the threshold, the value infinity is used for TAT

(regardless of the configured value), and UEs are synchronized.

## 3.1 PUCCH Resource Use

The PUCCH resource use depends on the number of resources reserved for scheduling

requests.

The PUCCH resource use is monitored both on cell level and on baseband processing resource

level within one Baseband unit. For more details on how PUCCH and scheduling request capacity

is configured on cell level, see Control Channel Dimensioning. The processing resource capacity is

calculated by the system based on several configuration settings.

## 3.2 Time Alignment Timer

The PUCCH capacity limits the number of users that can be served in a cell.

When the PUCCH resource use is low to moderate, it is beneficial to keep all served UEs

synchronized. This provides the best end user experience with low latency for the UE, and

saves processing and signaling resources in the eNodeB and the UE. The

EUtranCellFDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer or the

EUtranCellTDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer attribute controls the duration for

which an UE is kept synchronized. When all connected users are synchronized, the PUCCH

capacity limits the maximum number of users that can be served in a cell. Statistically, not

all UEs are active at the same time. To free PUCCH resources, inactive UEs are allowed to go

out of synchronization and thus allow more users to connect. This comes with the cost of added

end user latency when the UEs have data to transmit or receive.

# 4 Network Impact of Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load

This feature increases the number of connected UEs.

Capacity and Performance

With this feature activated and configured, the number of connected UEs increases.

This lets the UEs stay synchronized in low loads.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load

## 9.1 Using the Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load and Dynamic PUCCH Features Together

For activating both the Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load and Dynamic

PUCCH features, the EUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or

EUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers attribute must be

configured.

## 9.2 Setting Time Alignment Timer

To activate the Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load feature, the Time

Alignment Timer attribute must be set to a definite value.

The time that a UE is kept synchronized is controlled by the

EUtranCellFDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer or

EUtranCellTDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer attribute, which is set by the

operator at the cell level. The attribute sets the Time Alignment Timer (TAT) to either

infinity (meaning that UEs are always kept synchronized) or a definite time. The default

value is 0, which means the feature is inactive. To activate the feature, the TAT must

be set to a non-zero value. The recommended value is 1920 ms. If a specific time value

is set, then the UE considers itself to be out of synchronization after this time

period, as long as no new Timing Advance command is received.

Figure 1 shows when the TAT is set to a

specific value. The UE is forced out of synchronization so that the PUCCH resources can

be reused for other UEs. Figure 2

shows the TAT set to infinity, thus reserving the PUCCH resources for this UE throughout

the RRC connection.

Figure 1   Time Alignment Timer Expired with UE Session Out of Synchronization

Figure 2   Time Alignment Timer Set to Infinity with UE Session Synchronized

## 9.3 Inactivity-Triggered PUCCH Release at High Load Threshold

The feature combines the benefits of keeping UEs synchronized when the PUCCH use is low

and releasing UEs at high PUCCH use.

If the PUCCH resource use increases above a threshold on a cell or baseband processing

resource unit, the TAT is set to the operator-configured

EUtranCellFDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer or

EUtranCellTDD.tTimeAlignmentTimer attribute for the following subsequent

setups:

- RRC Connection Setup
- RRC Connection Reconfiguration
- RRC Connection Reestablishment

This means that UEs with the TAT set to a specific value can go out of synchronization

when no new Timing Advance command is received. RRC connections, which are

already set up, keep their TAT setting.

When the PUCCH resource use falls below threshold, the TAT is set to infinity regardless of

the configured value. This means that UEs with this TAT value are regarded as

synchronized.

Figure 3 shows the Inactivity-Triggered

PUCCH Release at High Load threshold where the resource use varies over time.
