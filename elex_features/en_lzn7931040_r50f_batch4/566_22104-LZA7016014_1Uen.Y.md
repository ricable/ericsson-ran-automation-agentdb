| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature allows the operator to reserve a share of cell-level UE resources for HPA

and emergency call users, depending on the configuration. The system reserves

cell-level UE resources for Privileged Access (PA), so that it can control the

number of users with non-privileged access in the cell.

The introduction of the feature does not change the maximum cell-level UE capacity

for HPA users. The cell-level UE capacity for non-privileged access and emergency

call users is lowered depending on the configuration of the HPA pool and the PA

reservation pool.

Inter-cell UE preemption is initiated when UE preemption is

unsuccessful in the cell where the UE with preemption authority requests admission,

and there is UE congestion on the eNodeB or the Baseband level.

This feature has the following benefits:

- If configured, HPA users have reserved resources, and their accessibility and mobility success rate increases.
- If configured, HPA and emergency call users have reserved PA resources, and their accessibility and mobility success rate increases. When the Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access feature is not activated, the full cell capacity is available for all users.
- If inter-cell UE preemption is configured, the admission rate of HPA and emergency call users improves.

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access

## 3.1 Cell UE Resource Reservation

Cell UE resources are reserved for HPA users in the HPA pool, and for HPA and

emergency call users in the privileged access reservation pool.

Admission control reserves a share of cell-level UE resources for HPA users based on the

configuration of the HPA pool, and for HPA and emergency call users based on the

configuration of the privileged access reservation pool. In a UE congestion situation

where the HPA pool threshold is reached, HPA users are admitted to the HPA pool and

preemption is triggered for each admitted HPA user. If the privileged access reservation

pool threshold is reached, HPA and emergency call users are admitted to the privileged

access reservation pool and preemption is triggered for each admitted HPA or emergency

call user. Therefore, the number of non-privileged access users in the cell is

regulated.

The cell-level UE capacity is lower for non-privileged access users depending on the

configuration of the HPA pool and the privileged access reservation pool. The cell-level

UE capacity is also lower for emergency call users depending on the configuration of the

HPA pool.

Users are considered to have privileged access and cell resources are reserved for them

in the following cases:

- The RRC Connection Request message is sent with the establishmentCause = highPriorityAccess or with the establishmentCause = emergency configuration.
- During RRE or S1 and X2 handover, the classification of the calls depends on the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) level of the bearer. If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default value of -1, calls are identified in the following ways: ARP levels higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute are considered emergency calls. ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute are considered HPA calls. Note: The activation of the Privileged Access Admission Balancing feature is not required for the feature to use the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute. If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to a non-default value, calls are identified in the following ways: ARP levels equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute are considered emergency calls. ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute, excluding the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute, are considered HPA calls.

## 3.2 Inter-Cell UE Preemption

The preemptable UE is selected in a cell different from the cell where the UE with

preemption authority is requesting admission.

Inter-cell UE preemption is initiated when UE preemption is unsuccessful in the cell

where the UE with preemption authority requests admission, and there is UE congestion on

the eNodeB or the Baseband level. If the candidate cell valid for inter-cell UE

preemption is selected from the list of cells reported as candidates,

UE

preemption is started in that cell. If inter-cell UE preemption is

unsuccessful, there are no further UE preemption attempts.

UE congestion only on the cell level does not trigger inter-cell UE preemption.

Cells must be configured as candidates to be qualified for inter-cell UE preemption.

The threshold for registering cells can be configured with the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg

The following processes register or

deregister

configured cells as candidates for inter-cell UE preemption, and are initiated

independently:

- Timer-triggered cell registration
- Preemption-triggered cell registration

Timer-triggered cell registration begins when the number of admitted UEs is close to

congestion in the eNodeB or the Baseband. This process checks the number of preemptable

UEs in all configured active cells, compares it with the register and unregisters

thresholds, and reports the candidate status of the cell. Cells are checked one by one

and the checking repeats with a configurable time span, until there is no UE congestion

anymore. The AdmissionControl.recalcPreemptableUeTimer attribute can

be used to define how frequently the cells report their candidate status.

Preemption-triggered cell registration is performed when the UE preemption is triggered

by congestion on the eNodeB or the Baseband level. This process compares the number of

preemptable UEs in the cell with the register and unregisters  thresholds and reports

the candidate status of the cell.

# 4 Network Impact of Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access

The feature impacts cell UE capacity

for

non-privileged

access and emergency call users.

Capacity and Performance

Cell UE capacity for non-privileged access users can decrease depending on the

configuration of the following attributes:

- AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell
- EUtranCellFDD.paConnCellUeReservations
- EUtranCellTDD.paConnCellUeReservations

The

cell UE capacity also decreases for emergency call users depending on the

configuration of the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell

attribute.

The full cell capacity is available for HPA users.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Enhanced UE Preemption for Privileged Access

## 9.1 Cell UE Resource Reservation

It is possible to configure different pools for reserving cell-level UE

resources.

The cell-level UE capacity for non-priority users decreases depending on the

configuration of the related attribute. The full cell capacity is available for HPA

users.

The

HPA pool and the PA reservation pool (for HPA and

emergency call users) are set up depending on the following configurations:

- The HPA pool can be configured with the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell attribute.
- The PA reservation pool can be configured with the EUtranCellFDD.paConnCellUeReservations or the EUtranCellTDD.paConnCellUeReservations attributes.

## 9.2 Inter-Cell UE Preemption

Cells are registered for inter-cell UE preemption depending on the configuration of the

following attributes:

- AdmissionControl.recalcPreemptableUeTimer
- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg

The threshold for registering cells for inter-cell UE preemption is calculated with the

following

formulas:

- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg + EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg + EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst

The AdmissionControl.recalcPreemptableUeTimer attribute defines how

frequently the cells report their candidate status. The cell report is the most reliable

with the default value of this attribute.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q4: Enhanced Intra-Cell UE Preemption

The feature enhancement introduces two pools to reserve resources for HPA or HPA and

emergency call users.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature allows the operator to reserve a share of cell-level UE resources for HPA

and emergency call users only. Depending on the configuration of the HPA pool and

the PA reservation pool, HPA and emergency call users are admitted into the

respective reserved resources.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The accessibility and mobility success rate increases for HPA and emergency call users.
- If configured, HPA users have reserved resources. Preemption is started for every HPA user admitted into the reserved resources before the cell-level UE resource limit is reached.
- If configured, HPA and emergency call users have reserved PA resources. Preemption is started for every HPA and emergency call user admitted into the reserved resources.
- It is possible to control the number of non-privileged access users in the cell by reserving resources for PA.

Capacity and Performance

The cell UE capacity is lower for non-privileged access users depending on the

configuration of the following attributes:

- AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell
- EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary78
- EUtranCellTDD.zzzTemporary78

The cell UE capacity is also lower for emergency call users depending on the

configuration of the AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell

attribute.

The cell UE capacity does not change for HPA users.

Depending on the configuration of the HPA pool and the PA reservation pool, a higher

success ratio can be observed for HPA UEs and a higher UE context release ratio, due

to preemption.

The feature enhancement can be observed with the following legacy PM counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPe
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPe
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa

Operation

The AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnHpaReservPerCell attribute is used

for the configuration of the HPA pool.

The following attributes are introduced for the configuration of the PA reservation

pool:

- EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary78
- EUtranCellTDD.zzzTemporary78

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                       |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows searching for preemptable UEs in all active cells

configured for inter-cell UE preemption, other than the cell where a UE with

preemption authority requests admission.

When UE preemption is unsuccessful in the cell where the UE with preemption authority

requests admission, and there is UE congestion on the eNodeB or the Baseband level,

inter-cell UE preemption is initiated. If the candidate cell valid for inter-cell UE

preemption is selected from the list of cells reported as candidates, UE preemption

is started in that cell. If inter-cell UE preemption is unsuccessful, there are no

further UE preemption attempts.

Additional UE preemption is started in the selected cell from the list of cells

reported as candidates for inter-cell UE preemption. If UE preemption fails in the

selected cell, no further UE preemption attempts are performed in other candidate

cells.

The benefit of the feature enhancement is that there is a higher chance for HPA and

emergency call users to be admitted into a cell during UE congestion on the eNodeB

or the Baseband level.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement does not impact cell UE capacity.

The Accessibility and Mobility main KPIs increase for HPA

and emergency call users compared to non-privileged access users. The

Retainability main KPI decreases for non-privileged access users

compared to HPA and emergency call users. These KPI changes are observable only when

there is UE congestion on the Baseband or the eNodeB level.

The following

existing

PM counters can be used to observe the number of RRC Connection Request attempts and

their success rate for HPA UEs:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa

- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst
- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg
- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg

The following attributes are introduced for the configuration of the PA reservation

pool:

- EUtranCellFDD.paConnCellUeReservations
- EUtranCellTDD.paConnCellUeReservations

The following attributes are deprecated:

- EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary78
- EUtranCellTDD.zzzTemporary78

The following PM counters are introduced to observe the number of inter-cell UE

preemption attempts:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUePeAttInterCell
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUePeAttInterCell

The following PM counters are introduced to observe the number of successful UE

context releases caused by inter-cell UE preemption:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPeInterCell
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPeInterCell

The feature enhancement updates the EVENT\_PARAM\_UE\_PREEMPTION\_CAUSE PM

event parameter with the following values:

- EVENT\_VALUE\_INTER\_CELL\_UE\_PREEMPTION
- EVENT\_VALUE\_PREEMPTION\_CELL\_THRESHOLD\_EXCEEDED

The activation of the Differentiated Admission Control feature is a prerequisite for

this feature enhancement. The

AdmissionControl.arpBasedPreEmptionState attribute can be

used to activate or deactivate ARP-based preemption.
