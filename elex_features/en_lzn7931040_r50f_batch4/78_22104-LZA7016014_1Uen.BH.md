# 1 Automated Mobility Optimization Overview

The Automated Mobility Optimization feature provides an RBS with the capacity to

automatically

calibrate

mobility parameters. It

allows

the operator to observe the occurrence of related problems.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license for each radio. |

Summary

The default mobility parameters in the RBS are not always optimized when an operator

deploys the network. An RBS with poor mobility parameters

might

encounter the following problems:

- Too early handover
- Too late handover
- Handover to wrong cell
- Ping-pong handover

The Automated Mobility Optimization feature reduces the number of radio connection

failures and unnecessary handovers,

which

increases

RBS throughput,

increases

RBS throughput and the quality of VoIP and streaming

services.

Depending on the network structure and customer needs, it is possible to selectively

deactivate

andactivate

the feature on three levels:

- Frequency-relation level
- Cell-relation level
- External vendor level

# 3 Feature Operation of Automated Mobility Optimization

This section describes the Automated

Mobility Optimization feature in more detail, including operation flows.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Handover Failure Detecting function monitors the connection failure and the subsequent RRC re-establishment during or before handover procedure to detect if the failure is caused by the following failures: Too Early Handover Too Late Handover Handover to Wrong Cell The OSS gets the detecting result by the events and counters. For more information, see Performance of Automated Mobility Optimization. The Handover Oscillation Detecting function monitors the handover behavior towards the neighbor cell to detect if Ping-pong Handover occurs. The detecting function is shared with the UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization feature.
2. The Mobility Parameters Optimization function monitors the output of the Handover Failure Detecting function and the Handover Oscillation Detecting function to evaluate if the mobility configuration parameters are allowed to be optimized. In case they are allowed, it checks whether the parameters need to be corrected and in what way.
3. The RBS enforces the updated mobility configuration parameters.

## 3.1 Mobility Parameters Optimization Function

Figure 2 shows how the Mobility Parameters

Optimization function works.

Figure 2   Mobility Parameters Optimization Function

### 3.1.1 Monitor Input Data

The Mobility Parameters Optimization Function collects input mobility events data during

every statistic period.

If EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is set to TRUE, then

statistics are collected separately for VoLTE users (QCI1) and data users (all QCIs except for

QCI1).

The handover quantity must be stable during each statistic period. The operator can configure

the period through attribute EUtranCellFDD.hoOptStatTime or

EUtranCellTDD.hoOptStatTime.

Automated Mobility Optimization calculates the timer value according to different algorithm

when it is activated for the first time. It is for distributing Automated Mobility

Optimization evaluations per cell (for all related cell relations) in time, so the eNodeB is

protected from increased Mobility Parameter load. After first Automated Mobility Optimization

evaluation, the timer is set according to EUtranCellFDD.hoOptStatTime or

EUtranCellTDD.hoOptStatTime settings.

Based on input events for each cell relation, the following data is counted.

| Nho   |    | Number of handover attempts, as well as Too Late Handover where handover is not             initialized.                                         |

### 3.1.2 Evaluate Automated Mobility Optimization Function Enabling State

In this step, the Mobility Parameter Optimization Function evaluates if Mobility Parameter

Optimization is allowed or not, to determine if it is suitable to continue the following

evaluation steps.

The decision is based on the following two attributes:

- Automated Mobility Optimization feature service state (FeatureState.serviceState)
- Automated Mobility Optimization function enabling state (EUtranCellRelation.amoState)

Mobility Parameter Optimization is only allowed if the following conditions apply:

- Automated Mobility Optimization FeatureState.serviceState is OPERABLE.
- EUtranCellRelation.amoState is ENABLED.

In all other cases, Mobility Parameter Optimization is not allowed.

The EUtranCellRelation.amoState is a read-only attribute that is set

by the node, according to the rules in Table 2:

Table 2   Rules for amoState Setting

| Parameter                         | Case 1   | Case 2        | Case 3        | Case 4   | Case 5   |
|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| EUtranCellRelation.amoAllowed     | T(1)     | T             | T/F           | T/F      | F(2)     |
| EUtranFreqRelation.amoAllowed     | T        | T             | T/F           | F        | T/F      |
| AmoFunction.amoAllowedInterVendor | T        | F and EeNB(3) | F and NeNB(4) | T/F      | T/F      |
| EUtranCellRelation.amoState       | ENABLED  | ENABLED       | DISABLED      | DISABLED | DISABLED |

(1)  TRUE(2)  FALSE(3)  Ericsson eNodeB(4)  non-Ericsson eNodeB

The Automated Mobility Optimization feature can be activated or deactivated on the node

level.

The operator can configure the Automated Mobility Optimization selective deactivation and

re-activation on the following levels:

- On cell relation level, by using the EUtranCellRelation.amoAllowed parameter.
- On frequency relation level, by using the EUtranFreqRelation.amoAllowed parameter.
- On vendor level, by using the AmoFunction.amoAllowedInterVendor parameter.Note: If AmoFunction.amoAllowedInterVendor is set to FALSE, the EUtranCellRelation.amoState is automatically set to DISABLED for non-Ericson eNodeBs.

### 3.1.3 Evaluate Statistics Volume

In this step, The Mobility Parameters Optimization function evaluates the statistics volume

to determine if it is suitable to continue the steps described in the following chapters.

It is necessary to have a statistics volume high enough to be able to evaluate the handover

quality. Otherwise, the statistic data in this period is abandoned.

For the Enough Statistics criteria, Nho &gt;= Tho must be true

(area A on Figure 3), where

Tho is the statistics threshold.

The operator can configure it by using the EUtranCellFDD.hoOptStatNum or

EUtranCellTDD.hoOptStatNum parameter.

For QCI1 CIO adjustment, the number of QCI1 mobility data input must be greater than or equal

to the minimum number of handover attempts for QCI1. The number of QC1 mobility data input is

indicated by EUtranCellFDD.hoOptStatNumQci1 or

EUtranCellTDD.hoOptStatNumQci1.

If the Automated Neighbor Relations feature is operable and its function ANR Detection of

Problematic Cells (ANR DPC) is active, it can impact the Enough Statistics criteria for the

relations with poor handover execution success rate. If the handover execution success rate is

below the Nho x probCellDetectMedHoSuccThres/hoOptStatNum value, (inside

the evaluation area B in the Figure 3),

then the following options apply:

- The next step (evaluate mobility quality) is triggered with less statistics (Nho &lt; Tho).
- The mobility parameters corrective actions can be taken earlier.

The AnrFunction.probCellDetectMedHoSuccThres parameter is the medium level

threshold for the handover execution success rate and it is used in the ANR DPC evaluation

algorithm. It is a configurable attribute on the MO class AnrFunction. For

the details of ANR DPC function see, Automated Neighbor Relations.

Figure 3 shows the mobility quality

evaluation area depending on the parameter values and the functions and features

activated.

Figure 3   Mobility Quality Evaluation Area

### 3.1.4 Evaluate Mobility Quality

In this step, the Mobility Parameters Optimization Function evaluates mobility quality to

determine if it is satisfactory and whether corrective actions are needed.

If Figure 4 and Figure 5 are both true, the quality is considered

unsatisfactory and corrective actions are needed:

Figure 4   Mobility Quality Check in Relative Value

Figure 5   Mobility Quality Check in Absolute Value

The relative threshold, Tperc and the absolute threshold,

Tabs are configured with the use of the

EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPerc and

EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbs parameters.

W(t) and W(last) indicate the aggregation of the exceptional

handover. W(t) is from this statistic period and W(last) is

from the last statistic period when corrective actions are taken.

W is calculated according to the following equation:

W = Nte + Ntl + 0.5 × Ntwc + 0.5 × Nwcr + 0.1 × Npp

If EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is set to TRUE, then

the mobility quality is evaluated separately for Data users and QCI1 users.

The following parameters apply to Data users:

- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPerc
- EUtranCellTDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPerc
- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbs
- EUtranCellTDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbs

The following parameters apply to QCI1 users:

- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPercQci1
- EUtranCellTDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPercQci1
- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbsQci1
- EUtranCellTDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbsQci1

W is calculated separately for Data and QCI1 users, taking separately

collected statistics into account for them.

### 3.1.5 Execute Corrective Actions

If the mobility quality does not meet the target, the following parameters are automatically

updated:

- EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran (CIO)
- EUtranCellRelation.qOffsetCellEUtran (qOffset)

If EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled is set to TRUE,

then CIO is adjusted separately for Data

(EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran) and QCI1 users

(EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtranQci1).

The operator can configure the adjustment range of the parameters with the

EUtranCellFDD.cioUpperLimitAdjBySon and

EUtranCellFDD.cioLowerLimitAdjBySon parameters.

## 3.2 Handover Failure Detecting Function

The Handover Failure Detecting function provides input for the Mobility Parameters

Optimization function. To detect the typical failure cases, the following handover failure

detectors are working in parallel in the RBS:

- Detector1, Too Early Handover, Handover Not Completed
- Detector2, Too Early Handover, Handover Completed
- Detector3, Too Late Handover, Handover Initialized
- Detector4, Too Late Handover, Handover Not Initialized
- Detector5, Handover to Wrong Cell, Handover Not Completed
- Detector6, Handover to Wrong Cell, Handover Completed

Cell lock and unlock causes the previously collected counters to be obsolete. So any feature

which performs cell lock or unlock automatically impacts this feature, for example the MIMO

Sleep feature.

### 3.2.1 Detector1, Too Early Handover, Handover Not Completed

The Detector1 detects a Too Early Handover case as shown in Figure 6.

## 3.3 Handover Oscillation Detecting Function

The Handover Oscillation Detecting function provides input for the Mobility Parameters

Optimization function. For details of the function, see UE Level Oscillating Handover Minimization .

## 3.4 Mobility Parameters Update Triggered Externally

The Automated Neighbor Relations feature can

trigger the mobility parameters update on the unused cell relations.

The absolute values of the

EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran and

EUtranCellRelation.qOffsetCellEUtran attributes are reduced to

the next corresponding valid values if the following conditions apply:

- The Automated Neighbor Relations feature service state is OPERABLE.
- The following conditions are fulfilled for the specific cell relation: Unused duringAnrFunction.removeNRelTime EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran &lt; 0

## 3.5 X2 Message Control to Other Vendors

The X2 signals sent to non-Ericsson eNodeBs are controlled with the

AmoFunction.allowInterVendorX2Signal attribute. The following X2

signals sent by  Automated Mobility Optimization are controlled:

- X2AP RLF INDICATION
- X2AP HANDOVER REPORT

The attribute has no impact between Ericsson eNodeBs.

# 4 Network Impact of Automated Mobility Optimization

Network capacity increase with the Automated Mobility Optimization

feature.

Capacity and Performance

The Automated Mobility Optimization feature increases the capacity in the network by

reducing the number of radio connection failures and unnecessary handovers.

Interfaces

This feature impacts the X2 interface. X2AP HANDOVER REPORT is modified with a new

Ericsson private EAB E-RAB Established With QCI-1 IE, which indicates that the QCI1

bearer is configured.

It is possible that the neighbor eNodeBs do not support the private information

element (for example, because of earlier software version). In these cases, the

Handover Report is handled as an input of adjusting Data CIO.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Coverage

This feature adjusts coverage of the cell by tuning mobility parameters. The

adjustment subsequently brings forward or postpones the timing of handover and cell

re-selection of the UE.

Mobility

This feature reduces the number of ping-pong handovers, and handover-related radio

connection failures.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q1: Overshooting Cell Removal

This feature enhancement improves handover success rate in networks with few handover attempts. It also enhances the interaction between Automatic Neighbor Relations and Automated Mobility Optimization.

| Feature Name:           | Automated Mobility Optimization    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3035 R4                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Self-Organizing Networks           |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0435 R5                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

This enhancement to the Automated Mobility Optimization (AMO) feature improves handover

success rate in networks with few handover attempts (less than 200 per day). AMO will

check for border optimization opportunity even if the total number of handover attempts

is low according to the available statistics. This is possible only if the detection of

the problematic cells function of the ANR feature is active, and the handover execution

success rate is below the medium threshold.

In addition, the feature interaction between the ANR and the AMO is enhanced. When both

features are active and the adjustment of the CIO is allowed, and already done by the

AMO, the ANR feature can be prevented from removing not reported or not used handover

relations from MOM, meaning to move to the candidate list or to remove them. Moreover,

for relations not reported with negative CIO values, the value is changed one step back.

This gives AMO feature a further chance to work on the relations to improve handover

statistics and to avoid the cyclic behavior when a poor cell relations are removed and

then discovered again by ANR.

Capacity and Performance

Slight improvement to node capacity due to decreased CPU load.

Fewer CGI reports will result in increased air interface capacity.

Operation

This change is enabled by default.

Retainability and Mobility KPIs may improve cell relations with a low number of daily

handover attempts and poor handover execution rate. Cell relations which are not

frequently used or reported are also getting a chance to be optimized by AMO and

stay open for mobility.

If there are overshooting cells in the network, they are removed from the neighbor

lists, and SINR is improved for the affected neighbors.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 18.Q3: VoLTE-Aware Automated Mobility Optimization

This enhancement introduces the option to separate CIO values for data users and

VoLTE users for the Automated Mobility Optimization

feature.

| Feature Name:           | Automated Mobility Optimization    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3035 R5                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Self-Organizing Networks           |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0435 R7                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

With the improvement, CIO values can be separated for data users (all QCIs except QCI1)

and VoLTE users (QCI1). CIO can be configured, adjusted, and optimized automatically,

and applied to corresponding UEs for VoLTE users (QCI1) and for Data users (all QCIs

except QCI1). The enhancement improves KPI retainability for VoLTE users by reducing the

number of radio connection failures and unnecessary handovers.

For detailed description of the improvement, see Manage Mobility.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The improvement introduces the following new attributes:

- EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtranQci1
- EUtranFreqRelation.cioQci1Enabled
- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptStatNumQci1 or EUtranCellTDD.hoOptStatNumQci1
- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPercQci1 or EUtranCellTDD.hoOptAdjThresholdPercQci1
- EUtranCellFDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbsQci1 or EUtranCellTDD.hoOptAdjThresholdAbsQci1

The improvement introduces the following new pmCounters:

- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoTooEarlyHoQci1
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoTooLateHoQci1
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoWrongCellQci1
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoWrongCellReestQci1
- EUtranCellRelation.pmHoOscQci1

The EVENT\_PARAM\_ERAB\_QCI1\_IND event parameter indicating UEs with QCI1 bearer is

added to the following pmEvents:

- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_TOO\_EARLY\_HO
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_TOO\_LATE\_HO
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_HO\_WRONG\_CELL
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_HO\_WRONG\_CELL\_REEST
- INTERNAL\_EVENT\_SON\_OSCILLATION\_DETECTED

Interfaces

This change affects the following interfaces:

- X2 Interface X2AP HANDOVER REPORT is modified with a new information element, which indicates that the QCI1 bearer is configured.

## Appendix A.c: 18.Q3: X2 Message Control to Other Vendors

This enhancement introduces a new attribute for controlling X2 messages sent to

eNodeBs of other vendors.

| Feature Name:           | Automated Mobility Optimization    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3035 R5                    |
| Value Package Name:     | Self-Organizing Networks           |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0435 R7                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |
| Access Type:            | LTE                                |

The enhancement introduces the AmoFunction.allowInterVendorX2Signal

attribute. The attribute introduces the option to select whether the X2AP RLF INDICATION

and X2AP HANDOVER REPORT signals are sent to eNodeBs of other vendors. With the use of

the improvement, unnecessary X2 signals sent to eNodeBs of other vendors can be

minimized. For detailed description of the enhancement, see Manage Mobility.

Capacity and Performance

AmoFunction.allowInterVendorX2Signal can be used to switch on or

off the X2 messages sent to the eNodeBs of other vendors.

Operation

The AmoFunction.allowInterVendorX2Signal controls if X2 messages

are sent to eNodeBs of other vendors.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware
