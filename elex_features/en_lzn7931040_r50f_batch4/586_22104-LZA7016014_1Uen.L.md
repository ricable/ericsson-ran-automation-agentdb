Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature does not support NB-IoT UEs and Category M1 UEs.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version

24.1 or later to support the MOM changes

introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Robust Uplink Link Adaptation for VoLTE

The Robust Uplink Link Adaptation for VoLTE feature improves uplink VoLTE robustness by

using a conservative uplink link

adaptation

in low and medium traffic

load.

The feature introduces the following attributes:

- SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst
- SubscriberGroupProfile.ulOuterloopStepSizeFactor

The introduced

attributes

enable the following functions:

- SINR is estimated based on uplink MCS upper limit and VoLTE codec rate. The SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst attribute is used to enable this function. The estimated SINR is then used in uplink link adaptation for VoLTE in good radio condition.
- GINR adjustment downward step is increased when uplink HARQ NACK is received in outer-loop adjustment. The SubscriberGroupProfile.ulOuterloopStepSizeFactor is used to enable this function.

Operational Process

SINR Estimation

To enable the SINR estimation function, the following conditions must be met:

- The QciProfileOperatorDefined.rohcEnabled attribute or the QciProfilePredefined.rohcEnabled attribute is set to true for QCIs related to VoIP transmission.
- VoLTE UEs are selected in an ASG.
- The SubscriberGroupProfile.ulMcsUpperLimit attribute is set to a value other than -1. Note: The smaller the value, the more conservative the uplink link adaptation.
- The SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst attribute is set to a value other than -1.

It is recommended to set the

SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst attribute

to the VoLTE codec rate for users in the ASG. If the value is different from the

VoLTE codec rate, the feature gain might be reduced. Alternatively, it is

recommended to set the

SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst attribute

to 0 to enable automatic detection of the different VoLTE codec

rates during the call.

GINR Adjustment Step Increase

To enable the GINR adjustment step increase function, the following conditions must

be met:

- VoLTE UEs are selected in an ASG.
- The SubscriberGroupProfile.ulOuterloopStepSizeFactor attribute is set to a value greater than 10.

Setting the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulOuterloopStepSizeFactor

attribute to a value greater than 10 lowers the uplink BLER target.

The higher the value, the lower the uplink BLER target becomes. Alternatively, it is

recommended to set the

SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst attribute

to 0 to enable the automatic detection of the different VoLTE codec

rates during the call.

# 4 Network Impact of Robust Uplink Link Adaptation for VoLTE

The feature improves uplink VoLTE robustness.

Capacity and Performance

The capacity and performance impact of the feature applies to VoLTE UEs

in

low and medium traffic

load.

The uplink throughput of VoLTE UEs might decrease

in

high traffic load.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

If the value is set to                                     -1, the function of estimating uplink SINR in                                 uplink link adaptation in good radio condition is not operable. |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows for more accurate estimated uplink SINR in uplink

link adaptation in good radio conditions when multiple VoLTE codec rates are used in

the network.

This feature enhancement has the following benefit:

- The manual configuration of a fixed VoLTE rate is not needed.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

If the value of the

SubscriberGroupProfile.volteCodecRateForUlSinrEst attribute

is set to 0, uplink link adaptation is enabled, and the VoLTE codec

rate is automatically detected.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version ENM\_24.11 or later

to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release

Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier

ENM versions also.
