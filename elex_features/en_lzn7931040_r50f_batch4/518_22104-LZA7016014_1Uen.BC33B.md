# 1 LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode Overview

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature is an energy efficiency feature that saves

energy by changing the MIMO configuration.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

The feature reduces power consumption in radios in the node. This is achieved by

automatically changing the MIMO configuration to a smaller MIMO or a SIMO

configuration when low traffic conditions are detected in the cell.

Based on machine intelligence techniques, the feature discovers, learns, and applies

optimal MIMO configuration automatically. The feature does not require manual

configuration, however, the model accuracy level threshold can be manually

configured.

In a smaller MIMO and SIMO configuration, power consumption is reduced because of

either of the following reasons:

- Lower RF radiation at the radio unit
- Shutting down the radio unit power amplifier of the deactivated TX antennas

The decision point and the capability depend on the radio unit capacity.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes related to manual model accuracy configuration. If the Release

Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier

ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

This feature gives the eNodeB the capability to change the cell configuration from

MIMO to smaller MIMO or SIMO when low traffic is detected on the cell.

As opposed to the MIMO Sleep Mode feature, the daily time window to perform MIMO sleep

detection is not configurable. However, the model accuracy threshold can be

configured.

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can be enabled on one or multiple cells on

each node.

Operation Modes

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature supports the following operation modes in

MI\_DETECTION Mode

The MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute can be set to

MI\_DETECTION without a license. This provides observability on

potential energy saving gain without reconfiguring MIMO, that is, without affecting

the network and traffic characteristics. The feature in

MI\_DETECTION mode performs AI training on traffic patterns in a

cell, which can later shorten MI\_SWITCH initialization time.

MI\_SWITCH Mode

If the feature license is activated, the

MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute can be set to

MI\_SWITCH. The feature performs continuous AI training on

traffic patterns in a cell, evaluating and applying optimal MIMO configuration.

The switching allows unused TX antennas to be deactivated without cell lock and

unlock to avoid cell downtime. When

MimoSleepFunction.portMergingEnabled is set to

true, 2TX is reduced to 1TX, and 4TX is reduced to 1TX or to

2TX. Reducing to 1TX increases energy saving gain and reducing to 2TX minimizes

coverage loss. Reducing 4TX happens by either turning off antennas 1 and 3 or

antennas 2 and 3, depending on the value of the

MimoSleepFunction.portMerging4TxOpMode attribute. With a 4TX

cell, gradual step down and gradual step up is performed to provide smooth UE

transition. This mode keeps high cell accessibility and retainability since the

ongoing traffic is not interrupted. This means that the existing UE traffic is

retained, and new UE traffic remains unaffected during the switching process.

When the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature with MI\_SWITCH is

activated, it deactivates radio chains without cell lock and unlock. This means that

signals for deactivated radio chains are lost because of antenna muting. It is

equivalent to a constant deep fading on the muted physical antennas.

If there is incorrect configuration, the Inconsistent Configuration alarm with the

following additional text is raised:

- Configured sleepMode MI\_SWITCH is inconsistent with combination of parameters dlChannelBandwidth, pdcchCfiMode, and subframeAssignment configured on parent cell MO.

For more information, see Inconsistent Configuration.

Conditions for entering and leaving reduced MIMO configuration are checked once every

minute. For entering smaller MIMO or SIMO configuration, the following conditions

must be met:

- The average PRB use within 1 minute is less than or equal to 10%.
- PRB use greater than or equal to 60% is not observed for more than 10 seconds within the 1-minute interval.
- No Privileged Access or voice calls are active.
- PWS is not broadcast.

Machine Intelligence Switching with Port Merging

See Table 3 for how signals for

deactivated radio chains are treated if LTE AI powered MIMO sleep mode with

MI\_SWITCH is activated with port merging.

Table 3   Machine Intelligence Switching with Port Merging

| Antenna                       | Muting                              | Merging the Signals For                          | Sending the Composite Signals Through   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2TX                           | Antenna 1                           | Antenna 0 and Antenna 1                          | Antenna 0                               |
| 4TX (4TX to 1TX port merging) | Antenna 1, Antenna 2, and Antenna 3 | Antenna 0 and Antenna 1  (1)                     | Antenna 0                               |
| 4TX (4TX to 2TX port merging) | Antenna 1 and Antenna 3             | Antenna 0 and Antenna 1  Antenna 2 and Antenna 3 | Antenna 0 and Antenna 2                 |
| 4TX (4TX to 2TX port merging) | Antenna 2 and Antenna 3             | Antenna 0 and Antenna 3  Antenna 1 and Antenna 2 | Antenna 0 and Antenna 1                 |

(1)

Antenna 2 and Antenna 3 are muted, and not merged to any

port.

The composite signal through antenna 0, antenna 1, or antenna 2 can be received and

decoded by the UE. It compensates for coverage loss in machine intelligence

switching MIMO sleep mode on a 2TX or a 4TX cell.

TM4 rank

2 Support for Machine Intelligence Switching from 4TX to 2TX

Without Port Merging

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature supports switching from 4TX to 2TX in TM4

rank 2 in MI\_SWITCH mode if the

MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute is set to

true. This allows for spatial multiplexing and up to two layers

to be scheduled when radios are muted from 4TX to 2TX without port merging.

Public Warning System Message Handling

After reception of a PWS notification message, the following procedures apply:

- Cell configuration from SIMO or smaller MIMO to MIMO is performed for all cells.
- Cells within the affected area are prevented from changing the cell configuration from MIMO to smaller MIMO or SIMO until PWS broadcast is over.

PWS notification messages can be the following types:

- Primary ETWS notification
- Secondary ETWS notification
- Primary and secondary ETWS notification
- CMAS alert

Priority Access Handling

Switching is delayed in the case of Privileged Access, including emergency, or if

voice calls are present. See Table 4 for

how the feature handles switching in the different operation modes.

Table 4   Priority Access Handling

| sleepMode    | Entering Sleep Mode           | Leaving Sleep Mode              |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| MI_DETECTION | No PA calls                   | No Privileged Access calls  (2) |
| MI_SWITCH    | No PA and voice calls (QCI=1) | None                            |

(2)

If there is a PWS notification message broadcast, leaving

sleep mode is performed without delay regardless of

Privileged Access, or voice calls present.

Privileged bearers prevent the cells from switching to reduced MIMO configuration. If

the ARP priority level IE of a bearer is equal to or less than the value of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute, the bearer has

Privileged Access. In this case, the following PM counters are not stepped, even if

the PRB use is sufficient to switch to reduced MIMO configuration:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmMimoSleepOppTime
- EUtranCellTDD.pmMimoSleepOppTime
- EUtranCellFDD.pmMimoSleepTime
- EUtranCellTDD.pmMimoSleepTime

If no privileged bearers exist, the cells can enter MIMO sleep mode with the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute set to a different

value than 0. For more information, see Privileged Access Admission Balancing.

Cell Sleep Mode and LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode and Cell Sleep Mode features can coexist on the

same node. MIMO Sleep state can be triggered by the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

feature during the cell sleep mode time window.

Dependencies of LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

## 3.1 Model Accuracy Configuration for LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

Model accuracy can be set to a lower threshold than the 90% baseline for the LTE AI

Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature to activate MIMO sleep state.

Baseline AI Model

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature changes the MIMO configuration to a

smaller MIMO or a SIMO configuration if low traffic conditions are detected in the

cell. The AI model predicts the traffic in 5-minute intervals. If the model

prediction is incorrect, and MIMO must be restored after SIMO is predicted, the

model accuracy threshold is lowered. The required model accuracy must be above 90%

for the AI model to be considered valid. If the model accuracy falls below 90%, the

AI model is not considered valid, and the predictions are not used for MIMO sleep

decision.

The model accuracy ratio is based on the acceptability of predictions shown in Table 5.

Table 5   AI Prediction Acceptability

| Prediction   | Actual   | Acceptability   |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| MIMO         | MIMO     | Yes             |
| SIMO         | SIMO     | Yes             |
| MIMO         | SIMO     | Yes             |
| SIMO         | MIMO     | No              |

The accuracy ratio is calculated based on prediction data collected over the maximum

of two days, using the following equation:

Equation 1   AI Model Accuracy Ratio

The AI model forecast accuracy is calculated with the following

equation:

```
Where:EUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoSleepInEUtranCellTDD.pmMiMimoSleepInEUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoSleepOutEUtranCellTDD.pmMiMimoSleepOutEUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoSleepTermEUtranCellTDD.pmMiMimoSleepTerm
```

Equation 2   AI Model Forecast Accuracy Estimation

Manual Configuration of AI Model Accuracy

It is possible to set a lower model accuracy threshold than the 90% baseline for the

feature to activate MIMO sleep state. This can be useful in cells where the traffic

pattern is difficult to predict by the algorithm.

Configuration is possible through setting the

MimoSleepFunction.modelAccuracyThreshold attribute to a lower

value. If the model accuracy drops below the threshold indicated by the

MimoSleepFunction.modelAccuracyThreshold attribute, AI model

predictions are not applied in MIMO sleep mode. If the value is 0,

AI model predictions are always applied.

The EUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoModelAccuracyDistr and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmMiMimoModelAccuracyDistr PM counters show the

distribution of the model accuracy value. The accuracy value is calculated at the

beginning of each ROP interval and the bin ranges are aligned with the values of the

MimoSleepFunction.modelAccuracyThreshold attribute.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

This feature can affect cell capacity, coverage, and handover requests.

Capacity and Performance

For low traffic hours, the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can temporarily

decrease cell capacity because of cell reconfiguration from MIMO to smaller MIMO or

SIMO.

Based on the mode of operation, the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can

temporarily decrease cell coverage because of cell reconfiguration from MIMO to

smaller MIMO or SIMO for low traffic hours and back for high traffic hours.

When a cell enters reduced MIMO configuration using 4Tx Port Merging function, it has

the following benefits depending on the operating mode:

- 4TX to 2TX port merging mode minimizes coverage loss
- 4TX to 1TX port merging mode increases energy saving gain

When a cell enters reduced MIMO configuration using 2Tx Port Merging function, it has

the benefit of minimizing coverage loss.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

This feature uses the same parameters as the MIMO Sleep Mode feature as well as a

parameter for threshold configuration.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

## 9.1 Cell Sleep Mode and LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode Co-execution

The LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can be active during the cell sleep mode

time window.

After the capacity cell exits cell sleep state for MI\_SWITCH mode, the capacity cell goes

back to full MIMO configuration.

For the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature to trigger MIMO sleep state during the

cell sleep mode time window, the

CellSleepFunction.capCellDlPrbSleepThreshold attribute is

recommended to be set to less than 10%. The reason for this is the fixed PRB threshold

for the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q1: 256-QAM Support for 4TX Cells with Machine Intelligence Switching

This feature enhancement enables 256-QAM in downlink when the 4TX cells are in MIMO

sleep mode with machine intelligence switching.

## Appendix A.b: 24.Q2.0: MIMO Sleep Mode and Inter-eNodeB Carrier Aggregation Coexistence

This feature enhancement enables full support for

MIMO

sleep mode on the ESCell during an inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation

setup.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory           | Mandatory                        |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables full support for the MIMO Sleep Mode feature and the

LTE AI Powered Sleep Mode feature on the ESCell in inter-eNodeB carrier

aggregation.

If the value of the MimoSleepFunction.sleepMode attribute is set

to ADVANCED\_SWITCH or MI\_SWITCH for the ESCell,

MIMO sleep mode-related data of the ESCell is forwarded to the PCell for correct

scheduling.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- On the ESCell, the downlink HARQ BLER might improve.
- On the ESCell, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt and EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt PM counters might increase.
- On the PCell, the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt and EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt PM counters might increase.Note: These benefits are realized under specific conditions. For example, the radios mute from 4TX to 2TX and before the ESCell enters MIMO sleep mode, the UE is scheduled to four layers on ESCell. Under a complex traffic model in the field, the increase of the pmRadioThpVolDlSCellExt and pmRadioThpVolTxDlSCellExt PM counters might not easily be observed.
- The power consumption of radio units of the Secondary Node might be reduced when entering MIMO sleep mode.

Capacity and Performance

Downlink throughput for ESCell traffic might improve.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                         |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the possibility to manually set a lower model

accuracy threshold than the 90% baseline for the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode

feature to activate MIMO sleep state.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Increased energy efficiency through allowing the cell to potentially enter MIMO sleep state more often.
- Improved observability.
- The AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature can be used in cells where the traffic pattern is difficult to predict.
- Sudden traffic changes which lead to ending MIMO sleep state intervals have less impact on the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

Capacity and Performance

Energy efficiency is increased while the following KPIs might

decrease:

- DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- DL PDCP UE Throughput
- Mobility Success Rate

The EUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoModelAccuracyDistr and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmMiMimoModelAccuracyDistr PM counters show the

distribution

of

the model accuracy value.

If the MimoSleepFunction.modelAccuracyThreshold attribute is set

to a value below the observed model accuracy, the following PM counters are stepped

in cells with a model accuracy lower than the 90% baseline:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoSleepIn
- EUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoSleepOut
- EUtranCellFDD.pmMiMimoSleepTerm

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement supports TM4 rank 2 after switching from 4TX to 2TX. The

feature enhancement applies to TX branch muting without port merging.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Downlink throughput might increase when TM4 rank 2 is valid for the UE in good coverage and high traffic.
- The rank distribution measured by the EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioTxRankDistr or the EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioTxRankDistr PM counter is consistent with the operational modes of the LTE AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

Capacity and Performance

In good coverage and high traffic, this feature enhancement might increase the

following KPIs:

- Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average DL PDCP UE Throughput

The Dl Spectral Efficiency of Prb Payload resource indicator might increase when TM4

rank 2 is used.

The E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost KPI might decrease when TM4 rank 2 is

used.

Downlink HARQ BLER might increase compared to the basic operation of the feature.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute to allow switching

from 4TX to 2TX in TM4 rank 2 in MI\_SWITCH mode.

This feature enhancement modifies the behavior of the

EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioTxRankDistr and the

EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioTxRankDistr PM counters so that the

correct rank value scheduled by the eNodeB is indicated when LTE AI Powered MIMO

Sleep Mode is active. Depending on the configuration of the

MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute, the PM counters

are pegged in the following way:

- If the MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute is set to true, bin [0], bin [3], and bin [4] are pegged.
- If the MimoSleepFunction.rank2Enabled attribute is set to false, only bin [0] is pegged.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

This feature enhancement is not supported in Radio Gateway configurations.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.1 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
