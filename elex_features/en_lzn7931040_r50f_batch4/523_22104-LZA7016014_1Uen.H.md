# 1 ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package Overview

The feature enables differentiated

parameter configurations for advanced subscriber groups to improve downlink spectral

efficiency.

| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                                      |
| Licensing:              | Licensed feature. One license is required for each node. |

Summary

The feature introduces the following configuration

options:

- Configuring a differentiated SCell SINR threshold for subscriber groups by introducing the SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute.
- Configuring a differentiated link adaptation setting for subscriber groups by introducing the SubscriberGroupProfile.lastSchedLinkAdaptMode attribute. Note: When the function is enabled, and there is only one UE scheduled in one DL TTI, link adaptation function allocates the largest possible resource to this UE in the DL.

The feature provides the following benefits:

- Downlink spectral efficiency increases for the cell when a positive SCell SINR threshold offset is configured.
- Downlink peak throughput increases for the UEs in subscriber groups when a negative SCell SINR threshold offset is configured.
- Downlink throughput might increase in high load when a positive SCell SINR threshold offset is configured.
- Downlink spectral efficiency can improve on the cell level while robustness is maintained for a small group of UEs, depending on the differentiated link adaptation setting.

# 3 Feature Operation of ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package

The feature allows differentiated parameter configuration for UEs in advanced subscriber

groups.

The operation of the feature is based on the ASGH framework that allows classification of

subscribers into ASGs. An ASG is a subset of all RRC-connected UEs in a node that

fulfills the triggering and selection criteria of a specific ASG profile.

The feature enables the following functionalities:

- Configuring the SCell SINR threshold for subscriber groups.
- Configuring the link adaptation setting for subscriber groups.

Figure 1   ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package Functionalities

## 3.1 Differentiated Configuration of SCell SINR Threshold

The feature uses the

SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute to

enable differentiated configuration for SCell SINR threshold value for SCell activation

and deactivation. With this configuration, the SCell SINR threshold of the UEs in a

subscriber group is different from the UEs that are not in the subscriber

group.

If the

SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute is

configured, the threshold for the UEs in a subscriber group is the sum of the following

attributes:

- CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres
- SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset

For the UEs that are not in the subscriber group, the

CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres attribute

determines the SCell activation and deactivation threshold.

The configuration of the

SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute

depends on the operator requirements and takes effect on the node level. If the

Cell-Level Scheduler feature is activated, the configuration takes effect on the cell

level.

For the effects of the configuration, see Table 2.

| Negative(3)                                                                                                                                      | Lower than for other UEs which are not in the subscriber group  | Decreases                                 | Increases                                                     |

(1)

This configuration reduces the SCell use in poor coverage

cells.

(2)

In high load, the higher offset configuration allows

more SCell resources with low spectral efficiency to

be available for other

UEs.

(3)

In poor coverage, it is not recommended to configure a

negative offset value because it decreases spectral

efficiency.

## 3.2 Differentiated Configuration of Link Adaptation for Last Scheduled UE

The EUtranCellFDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled and the

EUtranCellTDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled attributes control if the

link adaptation function allocates the largest possible resources to the only scheduled

UE in downlink. These attributes can be overridden for the UEs in a subscriber group if

the SubscriberGroupProfile.lastSchedLinkAdaptMode attribute is set to

a value different than NO\_OVERRIDE.

Configuring the SubscriberGroupProfile.lastSchedLinkAdaptMode

attribute affects the link adaptation setting of the SCell and the ESCell of the UEs in

the subscriber group. When UEs in the subscriber group have intra-eNodeB SCell and

elastic ESCell configured, the link adaptation setting of these cells follows the

configuration of the SubscriberGroupProfile.lastSchedLinkAdaptMode

attribute, sent from the PCell.

The

benefits of the configuration depend on the relative proportion of the UEs in the

subscriber group. If more UEs use the

EUtranCellFDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled attribute set to

false, the following effects can be achieved:

- Spectral efficiency can improve on the cell level.
- For the small group of UEs that use the EUtranCellFDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled attribute set to true, the number of retransmissions can decrease, resulting in better robustness.

To achieve better spectral efficiency for the cell and increase robustness for the UEs in

a subscriber group, the following conditions need to be fulfilled:

- The EUtranCellFDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled attribute is set to false.
- The SubscriberGroupProfile.lastSchedLinkAdaptMode attribute is set to ENABLE.
- A small number of UEs that need better performance are configured in the subscriber group.

# 7 Activate ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The ASGH Framework feature is operable and at least one advanced subscriber group profile is configured
- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Configure the parameters related to advanced subscriber group profiles.
2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012546 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012546 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package

## 9.1 Configure Differentiated SCell SINR Threshold for UEs in Subscriber Groups

Configure the SCell SINR threshold offset value to obtain better spectral efficiency

for UEs in a subscriber group.

This configuration is recommended to improve downlink spectrum

efficiency by using the

SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset

attribute.

Prerequisites

- The ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package is activated on the node.
- The value of the CarrierAggregationFunction.sCellScheduleSinrThres attribute is configured.
- If cell-level configurations are needed, the Cell-Level Scheduler feature must be activated.

Steps

1. Configure an advanced subscriber group for a small group of UEs.
2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.sCellScheduleSinrThresOffset attribute to a positive value.

## 9.2 Configure Differentiated Link Adaptation for Last Scheduled UE

Configure parameters related to link adaptation to obtain better spectral efficiency

for the cell and maintain good robustness for the UEs in a subscriber group.

This configuration is recommended to improve downlink spectrum efficiency on the cell

level and maintain good robustness for a small group of UEs that are in a subscriber

group.

Prerequisites

- The ASGH-Based Spectral Efficiency Package is activated on the node.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.lastSchedLinkAdaptEnabled attributes to false.
2. Lock and unlock the cell for the changes to take effect.
3. Configure an advanced subscriber group for a small group of UEs.
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.lastSchedLinkAdaptMode attribute to ENABLE.
