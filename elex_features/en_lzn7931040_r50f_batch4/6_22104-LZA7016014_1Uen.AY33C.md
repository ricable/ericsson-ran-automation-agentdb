Summary

Different UE distributions can be configured to use at different levels of cell

traffic load. A better use of resources can be achieved with this feature if dynamic

load balancing does not work sufficiently. This also applies if the dynamic load

balancing is not preferred.

# 3 Feature Operation of Load-Based Distribution at Release

The Load-Based Distribution at Release feature allows the operator to configure how UEs

are distributed between LTE frequency carriers at RRC Connection Release.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

The eNodeB achieves the distribution of UEs by including the IMMCI information

element in the RRC Connection Release message to the UE. IMMCI overrides any

cellReselectionPriority information sent in SIB3, SIB5, SIB6,

or SIB8 in the System Information. The configured distribution of UEs is static and

only affects LTE frequency carriers. The frequency to which a UE is released is

chosen randomly according to the configured distribution. The feature is not

dependent on X2 interface between eNodeBs. The feature also works if frequency

carriers are deployed on other vendor equipment.

The feature does not require inter-frequency measurements or handovers, and does not

restrict the number of UEs that can be handled within a certain time. Conversely, it

does not consider actual cell traffic load differences between cells and it only

affects UEs that are being released.

Figure 1   Sequence Diagram Describing the Load-Based Distribution at Release

Feature

## 3.1 Cell Traffic Load Levels and Proportion of UEs to Distribute

The feature provides the option to configure different UE release distributions,

depending on the traffic load in the source cell. The cell traffic load calculation for

the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature is the same as the existing load

measurement, Subscription Ratio, used for the following features:

- Inter-frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-frequency Offload
- Inter-RAT Offload to WCDMA

For more information, see Inter-Frequency Load Balancing.

Each time a UE is released, the traffic load in the source cell is checked against five

different thresholds included in IdleModePrioAtRelease. The highest

threshold that is smaller than the cell traffic load is used. It decides which of the

DistributionInfo in the

IdleModePrioAtRelease MO is used to set the UE distribution at

RRC Connection Release.

To reduce the number of active thresholds, it is possible to set the load thresholds

equally. The DistributionInfo

corresponding to the highest threshold is used. For example, if

IdleModePrioAtRelease.mediumHighLoadThreshold is equal to

IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadThreshold then

IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadDistributionInfo is used.

Figure 2   The Thresholds for Cell Traffic Load Deciding the Distribution to Use for

Load-Based Distribution at

Release

The DistributionInfo for each threshold

consists of up to eight references to frequencies of EUtranFrequency

MO. For each frequency, the corresponding proportion of distributed UEs is configured.

If the sum of the configured proportions is less than 100%, the remaining UEs perform

cell reselection according to System Information. Up to twenty four

different profiles, that is, instances of IdleModePrioAtRelease MO,

can be configured in an eNodeB. A reference to one of these profiles to be used in a

cell is configured in the EUtranCellFDD.idleModePrioAtReleaseRef or

EUtranCellTDD.idleModePrioAtReleaseRef attribute.

The randomly selected frequency, or group of frequencies, gets the highest

cellReselectionPriority in the IMMCI information element. IMMCI

includes all frequencies, and also IRAT frequencies, that have

cellReselectionPriority in System Information. However, if needed

the remaining frequencies have their priorities lowered in relation to the frequency

selected by the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature, see Figure 2.

Both a single frequency and a group of frequencies can be configured to be given the

highest cellReselectionPriority in IMMCI. A frequency group is

defined when a frequency given a proportion larger than 0% is followed by one or several

frequencies indicating a proportion of 0%. The proportion for the first of these

frequencies is then valid for all frequencies in the group, see examples in the

following tables.

Example 1

| 20%  | 20%  | 10%  | 10%  | 10%  | 10%  | 10%  | 10%  |

All frequencies are single frequencies. No frequency group is defined.

| 40%  | 0%   | 20%  | 0%   | 20%  | 10%  | -   | -   |

f5 and f6 are single frequencies with 20% respective 10% probability. f1 and f2 are

defined as a group of frequencies with the probability of 40%. f3 and f4 are defined

as another group of frequencies with the probability of 20%. 10% of the UEs perform

cell reselection according to System Information.

| 40%  | 0%   | 0%   | 0%   | 30%  | 0%   | -   | -   |

f1, f2, f3, and f4 are defined as a group of frequencies with the probability of 40%.

f5 and f2 are defined as another group of frequencies with the probability of 30%.

Note that the frequency f2 is part of both groups. 30% of the UEs perform cell

reselection according to System Information.

f1 and f2 are defined as a group of frequencies with the probability of 40%. f3, f4,

f5, and f6 are defined as another group of frequencies with the probability of 20%.

40% of the UEs perform cell reselection according to System Information.

f1 is a single frequency with a probability of 20%. f2 and f3, f4, and f5 are defined

as a group of frequencies with the probability of 20%. 60% of the UEs perform cell

reselection according to System Information.

Feature, Part 1

Figure 4   UE and Frequency Selection for the Load-Based Distribution at Release

Feature, Part 2

Process Steps

1. The feature acts when RRC Connection Release is done and at least one DRB has been setup for that UE.
2. If feature Subscriber Triggered Mobility is activated, then the SPID value assigned to the UE must be investigated.
3. If the UE is associated with a SPID value matching RATFreqPrio.spidList and Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is activated, the UE is not affected by the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature.
4. If the UE is doing CS fallback or release with redirect, the UE is not affected by the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature.
5. If the traffic load in the cell is below the IdleModePrioAtRelease.lowLoadThreshold, the UE is not affected by the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature.
6. Selection of frequency or group of frequencies:
    - The DistributionInfo corresponding to the highest reached load threshold is used.
    - If an HRL is provided for the UE, preventing UE selection towards forbidden target cells, the restrictions in the HRL apply. This means that a frequency is only included as a candidate for distribution if it has an allowed PLMN. If a frequency is removed, the probability for a UE to be released this to frequency as configured in distributionInfo is divided among the remaining frequencies in distributionInfo. Note: The following attributes are checked for each frequency relation: EUtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList UtranFreqRelation.allowedPlmnList GeranFreqGroupRelation.allowedPlmnList If these attributes do not match any PLMN from the HRL IE, then the frequency from the relation is not considered.
    - A frequency is not included as a candidate for distribution if it is not supported by the UE according to the reported UE capabilities. If a certain frequency is only supported by a limited fraction of the UEs, it can be necessary to configure an offset higher probability for release to that frequency to reach the desired proportion.
    - A frequency or a group of frequencies is randomly selected by weighting the frequencies according to the percentages given in DistributionInfo. If the sum of the percentages does not reach 100%, the UE can be selected to perform cell reselection according to System Information.
7. If the UE is selected to perform cell reselection according to System Information in the step above, no more action is taken.
8. The selected frequency or group of frequencies is given the highest cellReselectionPriority (7) in IMMCI. All frequencies with cellReselectionPriority in System Information are also included in IMMCI. In case of E-UTRAN, the maximum number of frequencies is eight if UE is compliant with 3GPP release less than 12. If UE is compliant with release 12 or above, the maximum number of frequencies is 15.
9. The following step is done only if cellReselectionPriority 7 is given to any frequency in System Information.
10. The cellReselectionPriority is decreased by 1 for all frequencies included in IMMCI from System Information except for those where it is already 0.
11. The IMMCI information element is sent to the UE in the RRC Connection Release message. The corresponding pmCounter is stepped. Note: The subpriority information field is also included in the IMMCI, if all the following conditions are true: The cell reselection subpriority for an NR frequency is set to a value other than zero in the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute. The UE is NR standalone-capable.

## 3.3 Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users

Selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility

feature if the subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the

configurable threshold.

If the LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users feature is

activated, a subscription ratio threshold can be defined for the serving cell. If the

subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the defined threshold,

the selected high-priority UEs are handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature.

If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the defined threshold, the

selected high-priority UEs can be handled by the following features, if they are

activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

The high-priority UEs can be selected using the following attributes:

- RATFreqPrio.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl
- UeProfileFilter.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl

The subscription ratio threshold can be defined using one of the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr
- EUtranCellTDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr

For more information, see LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for

High-Priority Users.

## 3.4 Enhanced Handling of LBDAR Distribution Information Lists

Load-Based

Distribution at Release Support for Citizens Broadband Radio Service

introduces the dynamic update of LBDAR distribution information whenever the frequency of a

cell is manually or automatically changed by the changeFrequency

action.

The

EUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency

or

EUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency

MO action reconfigures LBDAR distribution information lists that are only

referred

by changed cells or neighbor cells in the following ways:

- New frequencies, if they do not exist already, are added to the distribution information if the maximum number of configured frequencies are not reached.
- In CBRS cells, if the old frequency is not used and the new CBRS frequency already exists, the old CBRS frequency is removed from the distribution information, independently of the number of frequencies configured. The update of the LBDAR distribution information lists are done in one step as a replacement if the old CBRS frequency is not used and the new one does not exist yet. If the old CBRS frequency is still used and the new one does not exist yet, the new frequency is added without removing the old one.

In CBRS cells, after a new the

EUtranFrequency

MO instance is created, if there are any

WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority MO instances with the

WakeUpFreqPriority.eutranFrequencyRef attribute pointing at old

EUtranFrequency MOs, and there are no

WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority MO instances with

WakeUpFreqPriority.eutranFrequencyRef attribute pointing at the

new EUtranFrequency MO, a new

WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority MO instance pointing at the new

EUtranFrequency MO instance is created with the same priority as

the old one.

## 3.5 Periodic Clean-Up of Unused CBRS Frequencies from the Distribution Information

The periodic clean-up of empty CBRS MOs removes unused frequency references from

LBDAR distribution information lists as well.

Through the periodic clean-uo

of

empty CBRS MO instances the references of unused frequencies from all LBDAR distribution

information lists are removed. This must be done before the actual

removal of empty CBRS EUtranFreqRelation and

EUtranFrequency MOs. The

WakeUpFreqPriority.wakeUpPriority MO instances pointing at unused

frequencies are also removed.

The ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary57 MO

attribute

that currently configures the timer for removal of empty CBRS MO

instances is replaced with the following

attribute:

- AnrFunction.removeEutranFreqRelTime

Similarly

to

the changeFrequency-specific or periodic clean-up-specific

attributes,

the

distributionInfo

type of attributes have no restriction property to make the

modification of LBDAR distribution information simpler.

# 4 Network Impact of Load-Based Distribution at Release

The feature affects traffic load distribution and load-based mobility

features.

Capacity and Performance

If properly configured, the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature adjusts uneven

distribution of traffic load between carrier frequencies. The ability to fully use

the traffic capacity on all the available carrier frequencies is improved. The

feature is beneficial for system throughput and the number of UEs and E-RABs that

the LTE RAN is able to handle.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Mobility

The Load-Based Distribution at Release feature redistributes users by changing the

cell reselection priorities in idle mode.

Configuration of the Load-Based Distribution at Release feature is necessary to stop

the following features counteracting each other:

- Inter-Frequency Load Balancing
- Inter-Frequency Offload
- Carrier Aggregation-Aware IFLB
- UE Throughput-Aware IFLB

If these features counteract each other, the number of inter-frequency

measurements and inter-frequency handovers increases as a result.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows for simplified manual

updates,

and automatic updates to the configuration

of

the LBDAR distribution information. This allows the

LBDAR

functionality to work with full efficiency, as configured frequencies that can be

used for cell reselection are always available.

The cleanup of unused CBRS frequencies removes the frequencies

from

the LBDAR distribution information, allowing for the removal of the MO instances of

unused CBRS frequencies.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Lower probability of reaching cardinality limits, and thus potentially improving performance
- Optimized resource utilization
- Easier manual configuration and tuning of LBDAR distribution information lists

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

LBDAR distribution configuration is updated automatically when

MO

action changeFrequency is executed in

EUtranCellFDD, EUtranCellTDD,

ExternalEUtranCellFDD, or

ExternalEUtranCellTDD MO instance. LBDAR

distribution configuration is also updated automatically when MO action

pnpChangeFrequency in

ExternalEUtranCellFDD or

ExternalEUtranCellTDD is triggered by an X2 configuration.

LBDAR distribution information lists are reconfigured in one of the following

ways:

- New frequencies, if they do not exist already, are added to the distribution information if the maximum number of configured frequencies are not reached.
- In CBRS cells, if the old frequency is not used and the new CBRS frequency already exists, the old CBRS frequency is removed from the distribution information, independently of the number of frequencies configured. The update of the LBDAR distribution information lists are done in one step as a replacement if the old CBRS frequency is not used and the new one does not exist yet. If the old CBRS frequency is still used and the new one does not exist yet, the new frequency is added without removing the old one.

This feature enhancement introduces the

AnrFunction.removeEutranFreqRelTime

attribute, which replaces ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary57 attribute

for the configuration of removal of empty EUtranFrequency and

EUtranFreqRelation instances of CBRS frequencies. The

AnrFunction.removeEutranFreqRelTime attribute, preserves the

settings

of the ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary57 attribute after the

upgrade.

The

timer configured by the

AnrFunction.removeEutranFreqRelTime

attribute is used for the cleanup of empty CBRS MO instances and for the removal of

unused frequencies from LBDAR distribution configuration periodically.

The attributes of DistributionInfo in the

IdleModePrioAtRelease

MO instance that are used to configure LBDAR distribution information list do not

have restriction property anymore. This allows the

DistributionInfo attribute to be set for particular traffic

load level instead of deleting and creating a new

IdleModePrioAtRelease MO instance.

This feature enhancement updates the following attributes and actions:

- ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary57 (deprecated)
- AnrFunction.removeEUtranFreqRelTime (introduced)
- IdleModePrioAtRelease.highLoadDistributionInfo
- IdleModePrioAtRelease.lowMediumLoadDistributionInfo
- IdleModePrioAtRelease.mediumHighLoadDistributionInfo
- IdleModePrioAtRelease.mediumLoadDistributionInfo
- IdleModePrioAtRelease.lowLoadDistributionInfo
- EUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency
- EUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency
- ExternalEUtranCellFDD.changeFrequency
- ExternalEUtranCellTDD.changeFrequency

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.2 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
