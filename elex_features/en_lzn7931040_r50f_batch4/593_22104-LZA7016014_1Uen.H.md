# 1 LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility Overview

This feature enables mobility to NR standalone for UEs with a specific service

activated. The service is identified by a QCI.

| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each 								node. |

Summary

This feature optimizes the traffic steering strategy by allowing mobility to NR standalone

deployment only for UEs with a specific service, identified by QCI, activated. This

way, the UE can get better radio performance relevant for this service.

When the specific service is established, the eNodeB configures B1 NR standalone measurements,

which are independent of the UE coverage. This way, the B1 NR standalone

measurements are configured in the UE regardless of whether good or poor coverage is

reported in the source cell.

This feature provides an option to exclude some UEs with a specific SPID from being affected

by the mobility control. This allows mobility to NR standalone regardless of whether

the corresponding service is activated or not.

# 2 Dependencies of LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility

The feature requires the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature to be

activated.

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility

This feature introduces additional criteria to decide whether the UE can be moved to

NR standalone when the LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility feature is

operational in the cell.

Operational Process

1. The UE connects to the cell or another mobility trigger happens.
2. The eNodeB checks if one of the following attributes refers to at least one QCI to determine if mobility to NR standalone deployment is allowed for the UE: EUtranCellFDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef EUtranCellTDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef
3. The eNodeB checks if QCI criteria are met. The feature configures B1 NR standalone measurements only when QCI criteria are met. Otherwise, the eNodeB stops the B1 NR standalone measurement process and waits for another trigger. In case the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST or the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message is received, the eNodeB performs QCI check on the newly set up bearer or the modified bearer, and makes the mobility decision. Note: In case of the release of the last bearer with the QCI defined by the EUtranCellFDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef or the EUtranCellTDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef attribute, B1 NR standalone measurements are removed and mobility to NR is blocked.
4. The eNodeB checks if the LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility feature can configure B1 NR standalone measurements.
5. The eNodeB determines the NR frequency candidates to configure the B1 NR standalone measurement. If there is no NR frequency candidate, the eNodeB stops the B1 NR standalone measurement process.
6. The eNodeB configures the B1 NR standalone measurement for the determined NR frequency candidates to the UE.
7. The eNodeB starts the configurable waitForNRMeas timer. For more information, see Manage Mobility LTE.
8. The eNodeB waits for the measurement report from the UE.
9. Once the measurements are configured for the UE, the following might happen: If the B1 NR standalone measurement report is received, the eNodeB proceeds with Step 10. If the waitForNRMeas timer expires, the eNodeB starts the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer. The B1 NR standalone measurement might be reconfigured and the waitForNRMeas timer is restarted. The B1 NR standalone measurement is removed by a blocking condition or service deactivation. If the B1 NR standalone measurements are deconfigured, the eNodeB stops the B1 NR standalone measurement process and waits for the next trigger.
10. When the measurement report is received from the UE, the eNodeB evaluates it to determine if the UE is valid for mobility. The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is started if the following conditions are present: The eNodeB receives a B1 NR standalone measurement report containing a cell with not the highest frequency priority value. The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is set to a value above 0.
11. If the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is enabled and the target cell is valid for IRAT inter-system handover, the eNodeB initiates handover to the reported cell.
12. If the target cell is not valid for IRAT inter-system handover, but it is valid for RwR, the eNodeB initiates RRC connection RwR to the reported NR frequency.
13. If RwR is not possible, the handover process goes back to Step 8.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility

This feature can improve radio performance for the UE.

Capacity and Performance

This feature optimizes the traffic steering strategy by allowing mobility to NR

standalone deployment only for UEs with specific service activated. This way the UE

can get better radio performance relevant for this service.

This feature might limit the number of NR standalone measurements configured in the

UE.

This feature also affects the number of connected UEs with NR standalone

configuration.

Interfaces

This feature introduces the S1AP E-RAB SETUP REQUEST and the S1AP

E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST messages as the new mobility triggers.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.
- The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature is activated.
- The EutranCellFDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef or the EutranCellTDD.nrMobilityTriggerQciRef attributes are associated with at least one QCI.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012747 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012747 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR IRAT Mobility

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is required to exclude some UEs, specified

by SPID values, from the mobility restrictions defined by LTE Service-Triggered Outgoing NR

IRAT Mobility feature.

Interaction with Subscriber Triggered Mobility

The following mobility cases are supported:

- If the RATFreqPrio.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed or the UeProfileFilter.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed attribute is set to the default value of false in the corresponding MO instance, UEs with an SPID value can only be moved to NR standalone if the specific service is activated.
- If the RATFreqPrio.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed or the UeProfileFilter.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed attribute is set to true, UEs with an SPID value can be moved to NR standalone regardless of whether the corresponding service is activated or not.
- If the UE has no SPID value with a corresponding MO class or no SPID at all, they can only be moved to NR standalone if the corresponding service is activated.

The following attributes are associated with the SPID profile:

- RATFreqPrio.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed The RATFreqPrio.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed attribute configurations are applied on node-level.
- UeProfileFilter.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed The UeProfileFilter.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed attribute configurations are applied on cell-level.

The UeProfileFilter.nrMobilityTrigQciAllAllowed attribute is used

if the SPID value is configured in the UeProfileFilter MO

class                 and has any assigned GUtran frequency relation in the cell.

The UeProfileFilter MO class must contain unique SPID values,

therefore, only one profile can be assigned from one LTE cell.
