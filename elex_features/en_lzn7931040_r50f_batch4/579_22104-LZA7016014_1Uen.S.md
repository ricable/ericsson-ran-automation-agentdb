Summary

The Port Scanning Detection and Logging feature adds port filtering rules to the firewall of

the Baseband

Radio Node and uses an analysis tool to detect port scanning

attacks. The port filtering rules flag incoming packets that might be part of an

attack. The analysis tool monitors and analyzes the flagged packets. If

a

suspected attack is detected, a security log entry is created. The

security log entry contains the attacker source IP address, the destination IP

address, and the ports scanned that are relevant to the attack.

The Port Scanning Detection and Logging feature offers the following benefits:

- Detection of port scanning attacks by monitoring incoming traffic towards closed ports
- Simplified investigation process by creating logs of suspected attacks

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The feature has the following limitations:

- The feature does not monitor open ports. When the operator setup only allows access to open ports, for example, by using an external firewall, it is not possible to detect port scanning attacks.
- ACLs and firewalls might block or filter traffic that is part of an attack. This prevents the feature from detecting the attack.
- The feature does not monitor fast path traffic.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Port Scanning Detection and Logging

The feature uses port filtering rules to monitor traffic and an analysis tool to

detect and log port scanning attacks against the Baseband

Radio

Node.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. Port filtering rules flag incoming packets that might be part of a port scanning attack. The rules are added to the firewall of the Baseband Radio Node.
2. The analysis tool monitors flagged packets over the following protocols: Accordingly, the scope of monitored traffic is limited. For more information about traffic scope limitations, see Dependencies of Port Scanning Detection and Logging.
    - UDP
    - TCP
    - SCTP
3. The analysis tool analyzes the following data to determine if an attack is ongoing:
    - Source IP for incoming traffic
    - Destination port for incoming traffic
    - Number of packets per port over time
4. If the analysis tool determines that an attack is ongoing, a security log entry is written containing relevant information about the attack. For more information on security log entries, see Real-Time Security Event Logging.

The log entry of the port scanning attack includes the following details:

- Date and time of the attack
- Source IP addresses
- Destination IP address
- Destination ports

# 4 Network Impact of Port Scanning Detection and Logging

The feature affects the behavior of the Packet Too Big

ICMPv6 error message in routed networks.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

In a routed network, if the packet fragments of a reassembled egress packet are

larger than the MTU of the interface, the Packet Too

Big ICMPv6 error message is sent for the reassembled egress

packet, not each individual packet fragment. This impact persists after the feature

is disabled. A warm restart must be performed after disabling the feature to resolve

the impact.

# 5 Parameters for Port Scanning Detection and Logging

The feature has no configuration parameters.

# 6 Performance of Port Scanning Detection and Logging
