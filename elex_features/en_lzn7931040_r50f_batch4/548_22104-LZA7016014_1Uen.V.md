Summary

During mobile network operation various kinds of security threats can arise, such as

false base stations. This feature introduces a mechanism to collect and prepare data

for security checks without the use of additional hardware components. This leads to

improved network security.

Data is collected from the UE according to 3GPP specifications. The following

measurement types are supported:

- Inter-frequency E-UTRAN
- Intra-frequency E-UTRAN
- UTRAN
- GERAN

Security-Initiated

PM events are generated based

on

received measurements reports. These events are stored in the

eNodeB and are transferred to ENM in the following ways:

- In the Cell Trace
- In the UE Trace
- In the Cell Trace and the UE Trace

The collected data is analyzed in the ESM and compared to the legal network

topology stored in ENM to detect attacks on the network.

Regular security checks in the network efficiently prevent attacks on subscribers.

Once the CGI measurement of the candidate neighboring cell is complete, the             feature sends a measurement report to the eNodeB. The eNodeB then changes the DRX back             to its default value both in the UE and the eNodeB.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitation.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from the feature, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- It is recommended to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are also supported on earlier ENM versions.
- It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute.
- ESM version 4.5 or later is required to detect security threats based on result collected by eNodeB.
- The following UE capabilities are prerequisites for the LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature depending on the measurement configuration: FGI 14: A4 measurement and A5 measurement. FGI 15: B1 measurement. FGI 16: Periodical measurement reporting for non-automated neighbor relations measurements. FGI 22: IRAT UTRAN measurements and B2 measurement in E-UTRA connected mode. FGI 23: IRAT GERAN measurements and B2 measurement in E-UTRA connected mode. FGI 25: Inter-frequency measurements and reporting in E-UTRA connected mode. FGI 39: IRAT UTRAN TDD measurements and B2 measurement in E-UTRA connected mode. FGI 111: A6 measurement. See 3GPP TS 36.331 for further information on the following measurements: A1 measurement A2 measurement A3 measurement A4 measurement A5 measurement A6 measurement

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements

The feature collects and handles UE measurements that can be used to detect security

attacks on the network.

The measurements are collected according to 3GPP TS36.331 from the serving

cell of the UE and up to eight neighbor cells. The following data is collected:

- PCI of the PCell and the neighbor cells
- RSRP of the PCell and the neighbor cells for E-UTRA
- RSSI of the PCell and the neighbor cells for GERAN
- RSCP of the PCell and the neighbor cells for UTRAN
- RSRQ of the PCell
- CGI of the PCell and the strongest neighbor cell
- TAC for E-UTRAN
- LAC for GERAN and UTRAN
- RAT type

The following measurement types are supported:

- Inter-frequency and intra-frequency E-UTRAN
- UTRAN
- GERAN

Security-initiated UE measurements are configured through the MOM. The measurements are

represented by the following attributes:

- SecPmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq
- SecPmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq
- SecPmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat

Each attribute points to MOs that represent the frequency reference and the report

configuration.

The UE selection is configured by the

ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute.

The SecPmUeMeasControl MO instance and the

ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute must be configured to

enable the feature. The attributes that specify the frequency relation and the report

configuration must be set for each measurement. The

ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction must be set for each eNodeB.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence of LTE Security-Initiated UE

Measurements

1. The Cell Trace, the UE Trace, or both are activated. At Cell Trace or UE Trace activation, at least one of the following PM events must be included in a Cell Trace or UE Trace Subscription Profile: UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_INTERFREQ UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_INTRAFREQ UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_UTRAN UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_GERAN
2. Periodic or event-based reporting and the selection of the number of UEs must be configured in the MOM.
3. The eNodeB configures the UE to perform the measurements by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
4. The UE confirms the RRC connection reconfiguration with the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
5. The UE is reconfigured and performs all measurements except for the CGI.
6. The UE sends the measurement results to the eNodeB in the MeasurementReport message.
7. The measurement results are stored in the Cell Trace or UE Trace ROP file, which is generated in the eNodeB.
8. The eNodeB configures the UE to perform CGI measurements by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the strongest cell reported in the MeasurementReport message. The RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is configured in the following manner: Note: This step is possible only if the following conditions apply: The UE supports CGI measurements. The QCI1 bearer is not configured.
    - The purpose field set to reportCGI.
    - The DRX configuration is included.
9. The UE confirms the RRC connection reconfiguration with the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message.
10. The UE is reconfigured and performs the CGI measurement.
11. The measurement results are stored in the Cell Trace or UE Trace ROP file, which is generated in the eNodeB.
12. The eNodeB reconfigures the UE with default DRX and measurement settings by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
13. ENM fetches the ROP file containing the measurement results.
14. ESM retrieves the PM data and the legal network topology from ENM. The collected data is analyzed by ESM. For more information on ESM, see the Ericsson Security Manager library.

Configuration of UE Measurements

Priority of the UE Measurements

## 3.1 Priority of the UE Measurements

A maximum of two extra UE measurements triggered by Performance Management are

allowed for each cell at the same time, with an extra slot reserved for the Minimization of

Drive Test feature.

To prevent a negative impact on the eNodeB and UE performance, capacity, and KPIs, a

maximum of two UE measurement instances can be initiated by Performance Management for

each cell. If more than two measurements are configured, only the two instances with the

highest priority are selected.

The measurements initiated by the feature have the following order of priority:

1. Intra-frequency E-UTRAN measurements
2. Inter-frequency E-UTRAN measurements
3. IRAT measurements

If the PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature is active, the two measurement slots are

shared by the two features. The measurements initiated by the LTE Security-Initiated UE

Measurements feature have higher priority than the measurements started by the

PM-Initiated UE Measurements features.

If more than two measurements are configured, only the two instances with the highest

priority are selected. Because of that, it is possible that PM-Initiated UE measurements

are not selected if the LTE Security-Initiated Measurements feature is active.

If the Minimization of Drive Test feature is active, three UE measurements triggered by

Performance Management are possible instead of two. These three measurement slots are

used in the following way:

- One slot is used exclusively by the Minimization of Drive Test feature.
- For another slot, the Minimization of Drive Test feature takes priority over the other two features.
- The remaining slot is used by either the LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements or the PM-Initiated UE Measurements feature, in accordance with the priority list.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements

The feature increases the load on the network. The increased signaling affects

throughput, latency, and retainability. UE battery performance is also affected because of

UE measurement

reporting.

Capacity and Performance

The feature affects network load in the following ways:

- The feature generates RRC signaling between the eNodeB and the UE, which increases the load on the Uu interface. The load is increased when UE measurements are initiated and terminated, and when the UE sends measurement reports to the eNodeB.
- Each incoming measurement report from the UE generates a PM event, which increases the load on the eNodeB.
- The increased number of PM events increases the load on the transport network when the events are transmitted to ENM.

The feature must be configured and used in a way to minimize the following effects on performance:

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements

The feature affects throughput and latency KPIs. PM events are introduced that

indicate which UE measurements are

enabled.

KPIs

Table 3   Key Performance Indicators

| KPI                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UL Throughput         | Minor impact is expected on this KPI because of the following:  RRC signaling has scheduling priority over user                                                 data.     Measurement gaps can decrease uplink throughput. |

# 7 Activate LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012594 MO instance.
2. Create and configure the appropriate MOs that enable the UE measurements.

The relevant UE measurement events must be activated in the Cell Trace or UE

Trace scanner. To activate the PM events in the existing scanner, go to Step 3. To activate the

PM events in a new scanner, go to Step 6.

3. Suspend the existing Cell Trace or UE Trace scanner manually.
4. Add the applicable PM events to the Cell Trace or UE Trace scanner.
5. Resume the Cell Trace or UE Trace scanner.
6. Use a predefined Cell Trace or UE Trace scanner containing the applicable PM events.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012594 MO instance.
2. Suspend the Cell Trace or UE Trace profile or scanner that contains the UE measurement events manually.
3. Remove the applicable PM events from the Cell Trace or UE Trace profile or scanner.
4. Resume the Cell Trace or UE Trace profile or scanner.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements

## 9.1 Configuration of UE Measurements

UE measurements are enabled by creating and configuring the appropriate MOs. The

measurements are initiated when the appropriate PM events are activated by ENM.

MO Configuration

The following MOs must be created and configured to specify periodic or event-based

report configuration for the measurements:

- ReportConfigEUtraInterFreqSec
- ReportConfigEUtraIntraFreqSec
- ReportConfigInterRatSecNote: Only one IRAT measurement type can be initiated at a time. The measurement type is determined by the ReportConfigInterRatSec.ratSelectionSec attribute.

To enable data collection for the LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature, the

SecPmUeMeasControl MO must be created and configured to

specify the frequency reference and the report configuration. The UE measurements

are represented by the following attributes:

- SecPmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterFreq
- SecPmUeMeasControl.ueMeasIntraFreq
- SecPmUeMeasControl.ueMeasInterRat

For each measurement type, the frequency of the measurement must be specified by

setting the frequency reference in the SecPmUeMeasControl MO.

The ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute

allows for the selection of the percentage of UEs and separately configuring a

fraction of UEs for the LTE Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature on each

eNodeB.

The ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute must be set to a

value greater than 0 to enable the LTE Security-Initiated UE

Measurements feature on the eNodeB. The value of this attribute defines the UE

percentage selected to perform LTE security-initiated UE measurements.

It is recommended to set the ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction

attribute value to less than or equal to the UE Fraction value in ENM to avoid

having the measurement results missing from the ROP file.

If the ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute is set to the

default value of 0, no LTE security-initiated UE measurements are

performed on that eNodeB.

PM Event Configuration

The following PM events can be included in a Cell Trace or UE Trace scanner:

- UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_INTERFREQ
- UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_INTRAFREQ
- UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_UTRAN
- UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_GERAN

Each PM event corresponds to a measurement configuration, as specified in Table 5.

Priority of the UE Measurements

## 9.2 Reduction of Network Load

The impact on network load can be reduced by following recommendations.

The following methods can be used to reduce network load when using the LTE

Security-Initiated UE Measurements feature:

- When the Cell Trace is used, it is recommended that the UE fraction is set to 10%. It is recommended not to use more than 10% of the UEs for measurements.
- When the UE Trace is used, it is recommended to set the trace depth to a suitable value.
- It is recommended to set the ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute to a value that is less than or equal to the UE fraction value.

## 9.3 Incorrect or Adverse Behavior

The following adverse behaviors can be observed with the corresponding PM events:

- If the security-initiated UE measurements are started without the feature license present, the UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_EVENT\_FEAT\_NOT\_AVAIL PM event appears in the applicable ROP file.
- If the security-initiated UE measurements are started without the necessary MOM configuration already performed, the UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_EVENT\_NOT\_CONFIG PM event appears in the applicable ROP file.
- If the MOM configuration is available when the security-initiated UE measurements are started, but are removed while there are still measurements in the queue, the UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_EVENT\_NOT\_CONFIG PM event appears once in the applicable ROP file and the queue of measurements are emptied.
- When the security-initiated UE measurements are interrupted by other measurements with higher priority, the UE\_MEAS\_SEC\_EVENT\_INTERRUPT PM event appears in the applicable ROP file.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables operators to select the percentage of UEs and

separately configure a fraction of UEs for the LTE Security-Initiated UE

Measurements feature.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute.

The ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute must be set to a

value greater than 0 to enable the LTE Security-Initiated UE

Measurements feature on the eNodeB. The value of this attribute defines the UE

percentage selected to perform LTE security-initiated UE measurements.

It is recommended to set the ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction

attribute value to less than or equal to the UE fraction value in ENM to avoid

having the measurement results missing from the ROP file.

If the ENodeBFunction.secUeMeasFraction attribute is set to the

default value of 0, no LTE security-initiated UE measurements are

performed on that eNodeB.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
