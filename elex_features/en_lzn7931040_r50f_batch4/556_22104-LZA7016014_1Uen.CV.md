Summary

The feature extends the Release

with Redirect (RwR) function of the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

feature by enabling UE handover from the LTE network to the NR standalone network,

while maintaining the data and the voice

session. Handover is

performed through the N26 interface when the UE measures good coverage in an NR

frequency. Good NR coverage is indicated by B1 NR standalone measurements.

Handover is also performed when the UE measures poor coverage

in the current LTE frequency. If the LTE coverage is poor, B2 NR measurements are

used for mobility actions.

Compared to RwR, the outgoing NR IRAT handover procedure improves the end-user

experience in the following ways:

- Downlink packet loss is minimized by introducing support for direct packet forwarding.
- Service interruption is reduced.

| NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session                                     Continuity (FAJ 121 4983)            | Prerequisite   | Node-level prerequisite | The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature extends the NR             Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature by allowing handover to an NR             standalone network from an LTE network when NR coverage is good. The Outgoing NR IRAT             Handover feature is built on the framework of the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session             Continuity feature and reuses the B1 NR measurements initiated for RwR.  The B1 NR measurements are only             configured in the UE if good coverage is reported.  The B1 NR measurements are also blocked for             the UE in the following cases:  The UE is interested in MBMS on the serving frequency.     The UE is interested in MBMS on any frequency and MBMS is SCell capable.      The B2 NR measurements are only             configured on the UE if poor coverage is reported. If the UE indicates poor coverage,             existing B1 NR standalone measurements are deconfigured and new ones are blocked.  When the UE is                 moved to an LTE cell from NR Standalone by any of the following functions, the                 handover to the affected NR frequency is not initiated if the restriction is                   enabled:  The Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic                       Steering feature     The NR Data-Aware Mobility feature     Uplink-triggered Mobility Control at Poor Coverage for NR Standalone of the                       NR Mobility feature     The Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic                       Offload feature     The restriction can be enabled by setting the                   ENodeBFunction.mobilityBackToNrFreqDisabled attribute to a                 value other than 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Automated Neighbor Relations (FAJ 121                                 0497)                               | Related        |                         | The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature does not need manually             configured neighbor cell lists if the Automated Neighbor Relations feature is active.             The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature reuses the relations to             cells             that support NR Standalone created by the Automated Neighbor Relations             feature.  During the handover evaluation process, the             Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature considers all available information about the NR TAC             and the associated PLMNs in each cell. If at least one                 ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instance exists, the handover             evaluation process checks all available information about the NR TAC and the associated             PLMNs only in the attributes that belong to the                 ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances. If there are no                 ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances, then the handover             evaluation process checks the ExternalGUtranCell MO instance.  During IRAT handover, if the target NR cell has a                                 MORAN configuration, a short interruption might occur when the                                 source eNodeB removes and recreates the cell relation to the target                                 NR cell to correct the inconsistent neighbor configuration.                                 Inconsistent neighbor configuration can be experienced when the                                 neighbor NR cell is hosted by a gNodeB with MORAN configuration.  If the ANR-specific threshold is set to a                 higher value than the B1 threshold for preventing the creation of a                 weak                 cell relation, fewer neighbor cell relations are created. As a result, Outgoing NR IRAT handover to a weak NR cell can be avoided. In this case, the handover is not                 performed until the UE sends a B1 measurement report containing an NR cell that is                 strong enough to create a neighbor relation to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

For EN-DC-triggered intra-eNodeB handover, if the eNodeB receives the A5 and B1                 measurement reports and the target NR cell is on a denylist, the eNodeB ignores the                 B1 measurement and does not performs the intra-eNodeB handover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Handover to NR Standalone is not performed in the following             cases if the UE reports good coverage:  The UE is interested in MBMS on the serving frequency.     The UE is interested in MBMS on any frequency and MBMS is SCell-capable.

If the UE does not have an HRL, the access restrictions do not apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

- Support for direct packet forwarding is introduced, while indirect packet forwarding is not supported.Note: In case of network separation, supplementary transport network configuration is required to enable direct packet forwarding. Otherwise, direct packet forwarding fails.
- If the Cell Soft Lock feature is active, during the soft lock phase, no B2 NR measurements are performed when VoLTE is established for the UE. Additionally, NR cells are not considered as valid mobility targets for such UEs.
- Cell relations might be manually created when the target gNodeB supports only NR Standalone. The following configurations are supported by ANR: The gNodeB is configured with both NR Standalone and EN-DC. All NR cells act as PCell and PSCell.Note: No new cell or cell relation is created when the PCI is reported as unknown in the B2 NR measurement report.

Network Requirements

MME version 1.51 or later is required for this feature.

MME version 1.70 or later is required for handovers with an ongoing VoLTE

connection.

This feature is only applicable to NR standalone-capable UEs. The UEs must be

compliant with 3GPP release 15.4 or later.

# 3 Feature Operation of Outgoing NR IRAT Handover

This feature extends the RwR function of the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity

feature.

The feature enables the handover of UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode from an LTE network to an

NR network when the measurements initiated by the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session

Continuity feature indicate good coverage in an NR frequency. In this case, the Outgoing

NR IRAT Handover feature is evaluated before RwR.

The feature also enables the handover of UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode from an LTE network to

an NR network when the UE measurements indicate poor coverage in the current LTE

frequency. In this case, handover is evaluated before RwR, and blind mobility actions

are considered before measurement-based mobility actions.

## 3.1 Outgoing NR IRAT Handover at Good LTE Coverage

This feature uses B1 NR standalone measurements to select a mobility action for UEs

in good LTE coverage.

Outgoing NR IRAT Handover at Good LTE Coverage

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB checks if the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature can configure B1 NR measurements. The feature can configure B1 NR measurements if the following conditions are met: If the feature is not operable, the eNodeB stops the B1 measurement NR measurement process.
    - The license is activated.
    - The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasEnabled attribute is set to true.
    - The UE supports NR Standalone.
    - The UE supports VoNR if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
    - The ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
    - There are no ongoing emergency calls. Note: Emergency calls are defined with a QCI1 bearer or with a bearer where the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute is set to VoIP. If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default value of -1, the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) value of an emergency call must be higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. Otherwise, the ARP value must be equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute.
    - There are no ongoing MC-PTT voice connections.
3. The eNodeB starts the configurable UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas timer.
4. The UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas timer expires.
5. The eNodeB checks if B1 NR measurements are allowed. EN-DC and voice-type bearers might cause the eNodeB to stop the measurement process. If the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasAtEndcEnabled attribute is set to true, EN-DC bearers do not prB1 measurement NR measurements. If the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true, ongoing VoLTE connections do not prB1 measurement NR measurements. The following bearers are regarded as voice-type bearers: VoLTE bearers (bearers with QCI1) MC-PTT bearers (bearers with QCI65, QCI66, or QCI69) Note: Ongoing calls configured with MC-PTT bearers always prB1 measurement NR measurements. A bearer configured with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType set to VOIP is not considered as a voice-type bearer.
6. The eNodeB determines the NR frequency candidates to configure the B1 measurement NR measurement. NR frequencies configured by the GUtranFreqRelation MO class are selected as candidates up to the value of the UeMeasControl.maxMeasNR attribute based on the priority configured in the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute. The priority is configured in the GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute for UEs with an ongoing VoLTE connection.
7. The eNodeB checks the NR frequency candidates in the GUtranFreqRelation MO. If there is no NR frequency candidate, the eNodeB stops the B1 measurement NR measurement process.
8. The eNodeB configures the B1 measurement NR measurement for the determined NR frequency candidates to the UE and starts the configurable waitForNRMeas timer. For more details, see the Calculation of the waitForNRMeas Timer.
9. The eNodeB waits for the measurement report from the UE. If the waitForNRMeas timer expires before a measurement report is received, the eNodeB deconfigures the existing B1 NR measurement and starts the configurable UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer. If the UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas timer expires, see Step 5.
10. When the measurement report is received from the UE, the eNodeB evaluates the candidate cell to determine if the target is valid for mobility. If the eNodeB receives a B1 NR measurement report that contains a cell with not the highest frequency priority value and the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is set to a value above 0, the timer is started.Note: The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasWindow timer is started based on the priorities defined in the FreqPrioNR MO class if the UE has a SPID value.
11. If the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is enabled and the target cell is valid for IRAT inter-system handover, the eNodeB initiates handover to the reported cell.
12. If the target cell is not valid for IRAT inter-system handover, but it is valid for RwR, the eNodeB initiates RRC connection RwR to the reported NR frequency. The following types of RwR to NR procedures can be performed: RwR to NR is performed without the validation of the target NR cell if the following conditions apply: There is no ExternalGUtranCell MO for the reported PCI and frequency. The UE does not have an HRL. RwR to NR is performed with validation if the following conditions apply: At least one ExternalGUtranCell.pLMNIdList or ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList attribute exists with a value that is included in the HRL of the UE. For the PLMN that is included in the HRL of the UE, a non-empty ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC or ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute exists with a value other than -1. Note: The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature checks the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO first, and if this MO does not exist, the value of the ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC attribute is checked. If RwR is not possible, the handover process goes back to Step 9 and the B1 measurement report is discarded. Note: VoLTE connections are not valid for RwR even if the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true.

1. An EN-DC bearer is set up while the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is operable.
2. The eNodeB checks if the EN-DC bearer prevents B1 NR measurements. If the UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasAtEndcEnabled attribute is set to true, the EN-DC bearer does not interrupt the measurement process.
3. The eNodeB checks if there are ongoing B1 NR measurements in cases when the EN-DC bearer interrupts the measurement process.
4. The eNodeB deconfigures existing B1 NR measurements.
5. The eNodeB stops the B1 NR measurement process.
6. The eNodeB waits until the EN-DC bearer is released. If the EN-DC bearer is released, see Step 3.

Voice Bearer Check Process

1. A voice bearer is set up while the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is operable.
2. The eNodeB checks if the voice bearer prevents B1 NR measurements. If the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true and the UE supports VoNR, the VoLTE connections do not interrupt the measurement process.Note: Emergency calls and bearers configured with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute set to MC\_SIGNALING or PTT always interrupt the B1 NR measurement process.
3. The eNodeB checks if there are ongoing B1 NR measurements in cases when the voice bearer interrupts the measurement process.
4. The eNodeB deconfigures existing B1 NR measurements.
5. The eNodeB stops the B1 NR measurement process.
6. The eNodeB waits until the last voice bearer is released. If the voice bearer is released, see Step 5.

This feature uses B2 measurements to select a mobility action for UEs in poor LTE

coverage.

Coverage

Figure 4   Operational Sequence Diagram Continuation

1. The UE connects to the cell.
2. The eNodeB builds a set of candidate frequencies for mobility actions, including the NR frequencies defined by the GUtranFreqRelation and GUtranSyncSignalFrequency MO instances in the cell.
3. If the UE reports poor LTE conditions, the eNodeB deconfigures all ongoing B1 measurements for the UE. B1 measurements are blocked for the UE until good LTE coverage is reported. The eNodeB also assigns priority to the candidate frequencies. Prioritization is based on the following attributes: If the UE has an active voice or MC-PTT bearer, the GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is used. If the UE has no active voice or MC-PTT bearers, the GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute is used. If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is also active in the node, and the UE has a SPID value assigned, the FreqPrioNR.voicePrio attribute is used for UEs that have an active voice or MC-PTT bearer. For UEs that have no active voice or MC-PTT bearers, the FreqPrioNR.connModeMobilityPrio attribute is used.
4. The eNodeB checks if blind handover to the NR frequency with the highest priority can be initiated for the UE. The values of the GUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator and GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attributes are taken into consideration.
5. The eNodeB checks if B2 measurements can be initiated for the UE.
6. The eNodeB checks if blind RwR can be initiated for the UE. If the UE has an active voice or MC-PTT bearer, the value of the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is also taken into consideration.
7. If the UE reports good coverage and has no ongoing A2 measurements, the eNodeB stops all B2 measurements and restarts the timer defined by the UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas attribute. When the timer expires, the eNodeB configures B1 measurements for the UE.
8. If the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer timer expires while searching for a valid target frequency for mobility actions, the eNodeB checks if measurement-based RwR to the NR frequency with the highest priority can be initiated for the UE. If the UE has an active voice or MC-PTT bearer, RwR is not initiated for the UE, and the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer timer is restarted instead.
9. If a B2 measurement report is received from the UE, the eNodeB initiates handover to a reported NR frequency. If handover is not possible, but RwR is valid, the eNodeB initiates RRC connection RwR to the reported NR frequency. The following types of RwR to NR procedures can be performed: RwR to NR is performed without the validation of the target NR cell if the following conditions apply: There is no ExternalGUtranCell MO instance for the reported PCI and frequency. The UE does not have an HRL. RwR to NR is performed with the validation of the target NR cell if the following conditions apply: At least one ExternalGUtranCell.pLMNIdList attribute or ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList attribute exists with a value that is included in the HRL of the UE. For the PLMN that is included in the HRL of the UE, a non-empty ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC attribute or ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute exists with a value other than -1. Note: The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature checks the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instance first. If the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instance does not exist, the value of the ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC attribute is checked. If the UE has an active voice or MC-PTT bearer, the value of the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is also taken into consideration.

## 3.3 B1 NR Standalone Measurements

The feature uses the B1 NR Standalone measurements initiated by the RwR function of

the NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature.

The measurements are initiated if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature is activated.
- The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasEnabled attribute is set to true.
- The UE supports NR Standalone.
- There is no ongoing MBMS Interest Indication on UE.
- The UE supports VoNR if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection. This condition is fulfilled when one of the following capability fields indicates support: ims-VoiceOverNR-FR1-r15 ims-VoiceOverNR-FR2-r15 Note: These capabilities are related to specific frequency ranges, so the selected target cells must match the proper UE capabilities.
- The ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
- There are no ongoing emergency calls or bearers configured with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute set to MC\_SIGNALING or PTT.

The NR standalone frequency candidates are determined based on the setting of the

following attributes:

- FreqPrioNR.connModeMobilityPrio
- FreqPrioNR.voicePrio
- GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio
- UeMeasControl.maxMeasNR

The following attributes control repeated and non-repeated measurement configurations:

- UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas
- UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt
- UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas

The following attribute controls whether the B1 NR standalone

measurements can be initiated for the EN-DC-connected UE:

- UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasAtEndcEnabled

B1

NR measurements can be configured with the following

attributes:

- ReportConfigB1NR.hysteresisB1
- ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1
- ReportConfigB1NR.triggerQuantityB1NR
- ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrp
- ReportConfigB1NR.b1ThresholdRsrq
- GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override

## 3.4 B2 NR Standalone Measurements

The feature uses B2 NR standalone measurements for handover when the UE reports poor

LTE coverage.

The measurements are initiated if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature is activated.
- The UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActiveNR attribute is set to true.
- The UE supports NR Standalone and B2 NR standalone measurements.
- The UE supports at least one of the frequencies included in the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.band and the GUtranSyncSignalFrequency.bandList attributes.
- The UE supports VoNR if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection. This condition is fulfilled when one of the following capability fields indicates support: ims-VoiceOverNR-FR1-r15 ims-VoiceOverNR-FR2-r15 Note: These capabilities are related to specific frequency ranges, so the selected target cells must match the proper UE capabilities.
- The ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
- The ENodeBFunction.nrMobilityForMcPttDisabled attribute is set to false if there are bearers configured with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute set to MC\_SIGNALING or PTT.

The NR Standalone frequency candidates are determined based on the configuration of the

following attributes:

- FreqPrioNR.connModeMobilityPrio
- FreqPrioNR.voicePrio
- GUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio
- GUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio
- UeMeasControl.maxMeasNR

The following attributes control repeated and non-repeated measurement configurations:

- UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt
- UeMeasControl.waitForStartNRMeas
- UeMeasControl.waitForResumeNRMeas

B2 NR standalone measurements can be configured with the following attributes:

- GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override
- ReportConfigB2NR.b2Threshold1Rsrp
- ReportConfigB2NR.b2Threshold1Rsrq
- ReportConfigB2NR.b2Threshold2Rsrp
- ReportConfigB2NR.b2Threshold2Rsrq
- ReportConfigB2NR.hysteresisB2
- ReportConfigB2NR.timeToTriggerB2
- ReportConfigB2NR.triggerQuantityB2NR

## 3.5 Handover Evaluation

At the reception of a measurement report, the eNodeB evaluates the candidate cell to

determine if the target is valid for mobility and the mobility method to be

used.

First, the eNodeB checks if mobility to NR Standalone is allowed. The following

conditions must be fulfilled:

- The UE is NR Standalone-capable.
- The UE supports VoNR if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
- The ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to true if there is an ongoing VoLTE connection.
- There are no ongoing emergency calls.
- There are no bearers with the QciProfilePredefined.serviceType attribute set to MC\_SIGNALING or PTT.
- The emergency inactivity timer extension is not running.
- The QCI5 emergency bearer is not established.
- Service or Priority-triggered Inter-Frequency Handover measurements are not configured.

If these conditions are met, the eNodeB checks if the handover can be initiated. The

handover is initiated if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The license for the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is activated.
- The UeMeasControl.nrB1MeasAtEndcEnabled attribute is set to true for the EN-DC-connected UE.
- The conditions for the Release Inactive UE at High Load Handover feature are not fulfilled.
- At least one ExternalGUtranCell MO exists for the reported PCI and frequency.
- A neighbor GUtranCellRelation MO exists from the source cell to the target gNodeB cell.
- The GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true.
- The GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed is set to true for handovers where the UE has an ongoing VoLTE connection.
- The UE supports handover to NR Standalone. This condition is fulfilled when one of the following capability fields indicates support for handover: eutra-EPC\_HO\_ToNR\_FDD\_FR1-r15 eutra-EPC\_HO\_ToNR\_TDD\_FR1-r15 eutra-EPC\_HO\_ToNR\_FDD\_FR2-r15 eutra-EPC\_HO\_ToNR\_TDD\_FR2-r15 Note: These capabilities are related to specific duplex technology and frequency range, so the selected target cells must match with the proper UE capabilities.
- The ExternalGUtranCell.nRTAC attribute is defined. This indicates that the target GUTRAN cell supports NR Standalone.
- The HRL is empty or indicates that lists of PLMN IDs of external cells are allowed.
- The operating band from ExternalGUtranCell.bandList is available in the supportedBandListNR-SA-r15 IE.

If the measurement report contains multiple PCIs, the evaluation starts from the

strongest cell. The value of the EUtranCellFDD.minBestCellHoAttempts

or the EUtranCellTDD.minBestCellHoAttempts attribute is considered

before handover is attempted to the next best cell. If none of the reported gNodeB

target cells is a valid handover cell, the eNodeB checks if RwR can be initiated to the

reported NR frequency.

If the B1 NR standalone measurement report contains PCI for which there

are multiple cells known by the eNodeB, all ExternalGUtranCell MOs

are evaluated.

If RwR cannot be initiated, the eNodeB discards the measurement report. The next mobility

action can be initiated when the succeeding measurement report is received.

## 3.6 Voice Session Handling

The feature handles mobility actions for UEs with ongoing voice sessions depending on

the network coverage and the type of the voice session.

UEs are considered to have an ongoing voice session if voice-type bearers are established

for the UE. The following bearers are regarded as voice-type bearers:

- VoLTE bearers (bearers with QCI1)
- MC-PTT bearers (bearers with QCI65, QCI66, or QCI69)

Both handover and RwR can be initiated for UEs that have ongoing voice sessions,

depending on the following conditions:

- Network configuration used
- Network coverage reported by the UE
- Type of voice session configured for the UE

When evaluating mobility actions for UEs, the eNodeB checks if handover can be initiated

for the UE. If handover is not possible, the eNodeB checks if RwR can be initiated for

the UE instead. The preferred mobility action can be defined for each frequency relation

by

using

the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute.

For UEs in good LTE coverage that have an ongoing emergency call or a MC-PTT connection,

handover and RwR are not initiated. For UEs with VoLTE connections, handover can only be

initiated if the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is

set to true, and all other mobility conditions for handover are fulfilled.

For

UEs in poor LTE coverage, handover can be initiated if the

ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to

true, and all other mobility conditions are fulfilled. Handover is

possible for UEs with ongoing voice connections of the following types:

- Emergency calls
- VoLTE connections
- MC-PTT connections, if the ENodeBFunction.nrMobilityForMcPttDisabled attribute is set to false

RwR is considered for UEs with ongoing voice connections that report poor LTE coverage if

the ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled attribute is set to

true. If all other mobility conditions are fulfilled, whether RwR

is initiated for the UE depends on the following conditions:

- If the UE has an ongoing emergency call, RwR is not possible.
- If the UE has an ongoing VoLTE connection, RwR is only possible if the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is set to true.
- If the UE has an ongoing MC-PTT connection, RwR is only possible if the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is set to true and the ENodeBFunction.nrMobilityForMcPttDisabled attribute is set to false.

## 3.7 Calculation of the waitForNRMeas Timer

The waitForNRMeas timer equals the sum of the following two

attributes if the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override

attribute is set to its default value for all frequency relations:

waitForNRMeas = UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt +

ReportConfigB1NR.timeToTriggerB1

If the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override attributes are

set to values different than their default values, the

waitForNRMeas timer is calculated as follows:

waitForNRMeas = UeMeasControl.nrB1MobilityTimerLessTtt +

max(GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerNrB1B2Override)

# 4 Network Impact of Outgoing NR IRAT Handover

This feature enhances network capacity and improves KPIs.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhances network capacity by improving the possibility that the UE is

served by the best available NR cell.

The value of the following KPIs might be improved:

- Average DL Packet Error Loss Rate
- Average DL Packet Error Loss Rate per QCI

Interfaces

To support the feature, the following messages are updated on the S1AP interface:

- HANDOVER REQUIRED
- HANDOVER COMMAND

The HANDOVER REQUIRED message is updated in the following ways:

- The Handover Type IE is set to EPSto5GS.
- The Target ID IE is set to Target NG-RAN Node ID.
- The Source to Target Transparent Container IE is encoded according to the Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container IE as defined in 3GPP TS 38.413.

The HANDOVER COMMAND message is updated in the following ways:

- The Handover Type IE is set to EPSto5GS.
- The content of the rrcContainer IE from the Target to Source Transparent Container IE is sent to the UE in the MobilityFromEUTRACommand RRC message.

To support the feature, the following messages are updated on the RRC interface:

- MobilityFromEUTRACommand
- UE Capability Enquiry

The MobilityFromEUTRACommand message is updated in the following

ways:

- The mobilityFromEUTRACommand-r9 IE is used.
- The MobilityFromEUTRACommand-v1530-IEs contain the smtc-r15 IE.
- The targetRAT-Type IE is set to NR.
- The targetRAT-MessageContainer field contains the RRCReconfiguration message defined according to 3GPP TS 38.331. The RRCReconfiguration message is received in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

The UE Capability Enquiry message is updated in the following

way:

- The UE Capability Enquiry message for EUTRA\_NR and NR capabilities is configured based on UE capabilities, taking into consideration whether the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature and EN-DC-related features are activated. This means that the NR capabilities might be requested independently from EUTRA\_NR if the UE supports NR standalone only.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Outgoing NR IRAT Handover

The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature manages the handover of UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED

mode from an LTE network to an NR Standalone network when the UE measures good coverage in

an NR frequency or poor coverage on the LTE frequency.

Handover is configured with the following attributes on the eNodeB:

- ENodeBFunction.voiceMobilityToNrEnabled
- ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail
- GUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator
- GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed
- GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed
- GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction

If handover cannot be initiated, the eNodeB checks if RwR to the reported NR frequency is

possible. If the conditions for RwR are fulfilled, RwR is initiated.

In poor LTE coverage, RwR is possible for ongoing voice connections if the

UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is set to

true. For MC-PTT connections, RwR is possible if the

UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is set to

true and the

ENodeBFunction.nrMobilityForMcPttDisabled attribute is set to

false.

If RwR cannot be initiated, no mobility action is performed. In this case, a new

measurement report has to be received to trigger mobility.

## 9.1 Cell-level LTE to NR Standalone Handover

Attributes in the GUtranCellRelation and

the GUtranFreqRelation MO classes indicate if LTE to NR Standalone

handover between cells in the cell relation is allowed.

Handover to NR Standalone at Good LTE Coverage

LTE-to-NR

Standalone handover is initiated

if

the following conditions are fulfilled:

- A B1 NR standalone measurement report is received.
- All other conditions for the handover are fulfilled.
- The GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true.

The GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute also affects

the PCI.

If

this attribute is set to false for the strongest

PCI in the measurement report, weaker PCIs are evaluated for the handover

instead.

If the GUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to

false for all measured PCIs, RwR is initiated to the reported

NR frequency instead.

If the GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed attribute is set to

true,

handovers with an ongoing VoLTE connection are initiated when the B1 NR standalone

measurement report is received and the conditions for the handover are

fulfilled.

VoLTE session mobility can be blocked for particular cells by setting the

GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed attribute to

false in the cell for which the relation is defined.

Handover to NR Standalone at Poor LTE Coverage

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER, handover to NR standalone frequencies is possible for

UEs.

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER, blind handover can be initiated if there is a

neighboring NR cell with the GUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator

attribute set to COVERS. If the

GUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to

RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT, only RwR

to

that neighboring NR cell is possible for UEs.

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

HANDOVER, and the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is

active in the cell,

the following attributes must be set to

true to allow RwR in the cell:

- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed

If the GUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to

RELEASE\_WITH\_REDIRECT,

the

values of the following attributes are not considered for mobility actions:

- EUtranCellFDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellFDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrCriticalZoneAllowed
- EUtranCellTDD.rwrSearchZoneAllowed

If the UE has an ongoing voice connection, the

UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute must be set to

true as well.

## 9.2 Direct Packet Forwarding from LTE to NR SA

Packet forwarding from LTE to NR standalone is handled as part of the Outgoing NR

IRAT Handover feature.

If the ExternalGNodeBFunction.dirDataPathAvail attribute is set to

true and at least one data bearer is established, the

Direct Forwarding Path Availability IE in the HANDOVER

REQUIRED message indicates that a direct path exists between the source

eNodeB and the target gNodeB. In this case, direct packet forwarding is proposed.

Information about the bearers for which direct packet forwarding is proposed is included

in the Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent

Container IE in the e-RABInformationList IE. The

e-RABInformationList IE also contains information about the

bearers for which direct packet forwarding is not proposed. The maximum number of

bearers in e-RABInformationList is eight.

## 9.3 Configure UE Capability Enquiry

The configuration supports the exchange of the UE capability information in one, two,

or three messages between the UE and the eNodeB.

Prerequisites

The RRC UE Capability Enquiry message can be configured for

EN-DC-capable or NR standalone-capable UEs, or for UEs capable of both deployment

types.

Steps

1. Set the ENodeBFunction.ueCapabilityEnquirySteps attribute to one of the following values: ONE\_STEP The eNodeB sends one RRC UE Capability Enquiry message to the UE. The RAT-Type IE can contain the EUTRA, NR, and EUTRA\_NR values, see Table 3 for the details. The UE replies with one RRC UE Capability Information message containing the information for all three RAT types.Note: In case of the Initial Attach procedure, the eNodeB sends the RRC UE Capability Enquiry message in two messages even if the ONE\_STEP value is configured. TWO\_STEP The eNodeB sends two consecutive RRC UE Capability Enquiry messages to the UE. In the first message, the RAT-Type IE contains the EUTRA value. In the second message, the RAT-Type IE can contain the EUTRA\_NR and NR values. If the UE is only NR standalone capable, only NR is requested. The UE replies with two RRC UE Capability Information messages respectively. THREE\_STEP The eNodeB sends three parallel RRC UE Capability Enquiry messages to the UE. In each message, the RAT-Type IE contains a request for a different value. The three values requested separately are EUTRA , EUTRA\_NR, and NR. If the UE is only NR standalone capable, only NR is requested. The UE replies with two or three RRC UE Capability Information messages respectively.Note: In case of the Initial Attach procedure, the eNodeB sends the RRC UE Capability Enquiry message only for the EUTRA\_NR and the NR RAT-Type values in parallel messages. When the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature is introduced, each UECapabilityEnquiry message includes an rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE. The rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE informs the UEs that the UECapabilityInformation can be sent in segments.Note: When setting up initial connection, the eNodeB does not know if a UE supports the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature. Therefore, the eNodeB always includes rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IEs in the UECapabilityInformation messages when the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature is introduced.

## 9.4 Preventing Fallback to EPS Voice Connection

It is recommended to set the GUtranCellRelation.isVoiceHoAllowed

attribute to false in NR cells that have an

McfbCellProfileUeCfg MO instance configured with the following

attribute settings:

- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.epsFallbackOperation attribute is set to any of the following values: FORCED FORCED\_MEAS\_RWR FORCED\_MEAS\_IRAT\_HO
- The McfbCellProfileUeCfg.rejectVoiceIncHoAtEpsFb attribute is set to true.

These settings cause the gNodeB to fall back to the EPS voice connection that is

established in the cell through the initial call setup procedure. Therefore, the gNodeB

rejects incoming handover attempts from UEs with ongoing VoLTE connections.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement extends the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature to initiate

both blind and measurement-based mobility actions to NR standalone networks if the

UE measures poor LTE coverage. The feature enhancement also introduces

the

B2 NR event measurement framework for UE mobility actions if the LTE coverage is

poor.

The Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature can also interact with the Mobility Control at

Poor Coverage feature, as well as the MBMS service.

This feature enhancement provides additional mobility actions for UEs, which can

improve UE performance through offering the option for coverage by the best

available network.

This feature enhancement has the following

limitations:

- If the UE reports the PCI as unknown in the B2 NR measurement report, the ANR does not create neighbor relations between the serving cell and the reported cell.
- If the Cell Soft Lock feature is active in the cell, during the soft lock phase, no B2 NR measurements are performed when VoLTE is established for the UE. Additionally, NR cells are not considered as valid mobility targets for such UEs.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement can

improve UE performance by increasing the chance

for coverage by the best available network.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces support for the inner and outer search zones, as

well as the critical zone, for mobility actions to NR frequencies if the Mobility

Control at Poor Coverage feature is also active in the node.

This feature enhancement introduces the ReportConfigB2NR MO

class                 under the existing UeMeasControl MO class to configure B2 NR

event measurements. The ReportConfigB2NR MO class contains the

following attributes:

- ReportConfigB2NR.b2Threshold1Rsrp

Subscriber Triggered Mobility

## Appendix A.d: 24.Q4.0: Enhanced Outgoing NR IRAT Handover

This feature enhancement introduces coordination between RwR to NR Standalone and the

NR RACH procedure by delaying B1 NR measurement configuration.

| Feature Name           | Outgoing NR IRAT Handover   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5377                |

Summary and Benefits

When RwR to NR Standalone by B1 NR measurement reporting on LTE good coverage can be

operable in EN-DC state, the RwR procedure can cause conflicts with the NR RACH

procedure and result. The conflict results in abnormal release of Secondary gNodeBs.

To avoid the conflict, the master eNodeB can delay B1 NR measurement configuration

when NR RACH procedure is expected.

The length of the delay can be configured through  a new Temp MOM

ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary88 attribute, which need to be

aligned with T304 on SgNB side.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the Temp MOM

ENodeBFunction.zzzTemporary88 attribute to configure the B1

NR measurement configuration delay. The value of the attribute must be aligned with

the value of the T304 attribute in the secondary gNodeB.
