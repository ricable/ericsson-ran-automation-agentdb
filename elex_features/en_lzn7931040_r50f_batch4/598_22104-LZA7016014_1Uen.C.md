Hardware

The feature is supported on RAN Compute units in RAN Compute group 6. For a

description of supported configurations, see DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity in Radio Node Configurations.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE 25-33 Cell Support

The feature increases the number of supported cells to 33 on RAN Compute units in RAN

Compute group 6.

The feature supports the configuration of up to 33 cells on RAN Compute units with an

equal or different number of carrier branches on different cells up to the maximum

supported antenna bandwidth. The number of supported cells on a RAN Compute unit also

depends on the total number of TX/RX carrier branches and the cell range, which is

configured for each cell.

For more information on the supported configurations, see the DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.

The number of cells of the following MO classes is increased from 24 to 33:

- EUtranCellFDD
- EUtranCellTDD
- ExternalEUtranCellFDD
- ExternalEUtranCellTDD
- ExternalEUtranCellUnlicensed

## 3.1 License Handling

The LTE 25-33 Cell Support feature is associated with several alarms related to

license handling.
