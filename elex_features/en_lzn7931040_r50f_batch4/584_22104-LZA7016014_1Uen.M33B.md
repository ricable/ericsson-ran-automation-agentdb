# 1 Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility Overview

This feature introduces a downlink-triggered VoLTE mobility procedure for UEs with

voice bearers that is performed when fast degradation of the downlink radio conditions

occurs.

Summary

UEs with a voice bearer might lose downlink voice packets if downlink coverage is

insufficient. This feature detects the fast degradation of downlink conditions by

monitoring HARQ statistics. If downlink conditions are degraded, the feature

performs intra-LTE inter-frequency measurement-based handover or

blind handover to move the UE to a cell with better coverage.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Packet loss is reduced.
- VoLTE quality is improved.

# 3 Feature Operation of Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

The feature performs measurement-based or blind handover to move UEs with a voice

bearer to a cell on a better LTE frequency layer if fast degradation of downlink radio

conditions is detected.

The feature is enabled by setting the

EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobDetect or the

EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobDetect attribute to one of the

following values:

- MEASBASEDHO to perform measurement-based handover.
- BLINDHO to perform blind handover.

Measurement-Based Handover

Blind Handover

## 3.1 Measurement-Based Handover

During measurement-based handover, the UE measures the signal strength or quality of

the target cell in the candidate frequency. If the measurement result meets certain

criteria, the eNodeB performs a UE handover to the target cell.

Target Cell Selection for Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with

Measurement-Based Handover

The following configuration is needed in the target frequency to be selected as a

candidate frequency for measurement-based handover:

- The EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is configured for each frequency relation. Only the frequency with the highest priority defined by the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is selected as a candidate frequency for measurement-based handover. If the highest priority value is shared by more than one frequency layer, all those frequencies are selected as candidates for measurement-based handover. For example, if the value of the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is set to 6 for four frequencies, and all the other frequencies have lower values, all four frequencies with a value of 6 are chosen as candidates for measurement-based handover. If the value of the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is set to -1, the frequency is not chosen as a candidate frequency.
- The value of the EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER.

The cells in the measurement report must meet the following criteria to be considered

as a target cell:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to true.

Process Steps

1. The eNodeB detects potential downlink packet loss by monitoring HARQ statistics. When DTX appears in the downlink HARQ feedback, the eNodeB monitors the number of downlink DTX, HARQ ACK, and HARQ NACK feedback within the next transmission subframes defined by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobWindowLen or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobWindowLen attributes.
2. The combined number of downlink DTX and HARQ NACK feedback determines potential downlink packet loss. The higher the number, the larger the potential downlink packet loss is. The eNodeB compares the potential downlink packet loss to the thresholds set by the following attributes: EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow If one of the following cases occurs, potential downlink packet loss is detected: The upper threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute is greater than the lower threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute, and the potential downlink packet loss is between the two thresholds. The upper threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute is less than or equal to the lower threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute, and the potential downlink packet loss is greater than or equal to the lower threshold. In the following other cases, potential downlink packet loss is not detected and the eNodeB continues to monitor HARQ statistics:
    - If the potential downlink packet loss is lower than the lower threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute, it indicates that channel quality is good. In this case, UE handover is not necessary.
    - If the potential downlink packet loss is greater than the upper threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute, it indicates that channel quality is too poor. In this case, the UE might not receive measurement commands or successfully send measurement reports, so the measurement is not triggered.
3. The eNodeB determines a set of frequency candidates based on the related attributes specified in Target Cell Selection for Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Measurement-Based Handover.
4. If the frequency set is empty, no target frequency can be selected. The handover cannot be performed and the procedure stops.
5. The eNodeB starts an A5 measurement. The time period the eNodeB waits for the measurement report is defined by setting the UeMeasControl.a5TimerUlVolteCovMob attribute.
6. If the eNodeB receives the A5 measurement report, it performs measurement-based handover to the target cell.
7. If the eNodeB does not receive the A5 measurement report before the timer expires, the measurement-based handover cannot be performed, and the A5 measurement is terminated. Measurement-based handover is only triggered once during a call in a single cell. The procedure also stops if the voice bearer is released.

## 3.2 Blind Handover

During blind handover, the eNodeB assumes the coverage of the target cell and

performs UE handover without any measurements on the target cell.

Blind handover can be initiated only if the

EUtranCellFDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed or the

EUtranCellTDD.covTriggerdBlindHoAllowed attribute is set to

true in the serving cell.

Target Cell Selection for Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Blind

Handover

The following configuration is needed for target cell selection in the candidate

frequency for blind handover:

- The EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is configured for each frequency relation. Only the frequency with the highest priority defined by the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is eligible for random selection for blind handover. If the highest priority value is shared by more than one frequency layer, all those frequencies are selected as candidates for blind handover. For example, if the value of the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is set to 6 for four frequencies, and all the other frequencies have lower values, all four frequencies with a value of 6 are eligible for random selection for blind handover. If the value of EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute is set to -1, the frequency is not chosen as a candidate frequency.
- The value of the EUtranFreqRelation.mobilityAction attribute is set to HANDOVER.

The cells in the candidate frequency must meet the following criteria to be

considered as a target cell:

- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.mobilityStatus attribute is set to true.
- The value of the EUtranCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute is set to COVERS.

2. The combined number of downlink DTX and HARQ NACK feedback determines potential downlink packet loss. The higher the number, the larger the potential downlink packet loss is. The eNodeB compares the potential downlink packet loss to the thresholds set by the following attributes: EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow If one of the following cases occurs, potential downlink packet loss is detected: The upper threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute is greater than the lower threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute, and the potential downlink packet loss is between the two thresholds. The upper threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute is less than or equal to the lower threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute, and the potential downlink packet loss is greater than or equal to the lower threshold. In the following other cases, potential downlink packet loss is not detected and the eNodeB continues to monitor HARQ statistics:
    - If the potential downlink packet loss is lower than the lower threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute, it indicates that channel quality is good. In this case, UE handover is not necessary.
    - If the potential downlink packet loss is greater than the upper threshold set by the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute, it indicates that the channel quality is too poor. In this case, the UE might not receive the handover command. It is recommended to configure the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute lower than the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute. If the E-RAB Retainability - Percentage Lost per QCI KPI significantly increases for QCI1 bearers, it is recommended to configure the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrHigh attribute higher than the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow or the EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobThrLow attribute.
3. The eNodeB determines a set of frequency candidates based on the values of the EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio attribute and selects the target cell in the target frequencies. The selection is based on the configuration requirements for coverage relations specified in Target Cell Selection for Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility with Blind Handover.
4. If the target cell list is empty, no target cell can be selected. The handover cannot be performed, and the procedure stops.
5. If the target cell list contains at least one cell, the eNodeB performs the blind handover to the target cell. Blind handover is only triggered once during a call in a single cell.

# 6 Performance of Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

This feature is associated with integrity KPIs and other performance indicators. The

feature introduces PM counters to observe the number of handovers and downlink packet loss

indication triggered by the feature.

KPIs

This feature might improve VoLTE quality if all of the following conditions are

met:

- A large VoLTE packet loss occurs because of PDSCH DTX.
- VoLTE load is high or medium in the eNodeB.
- Measurement-based or blind handover can be performed.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

## 9.1 Simultaneous Operation of Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility and Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

If the Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility and the Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

features are enabled simultaneously, the two features affect the operation and performance

of each other.

If both features are enabled, the feature that first

indicates packet loss triggers the handover. The packet loss later indicated by either

of the features is discarded. This means handover is triggered only once in a single

cell during a voice call. This can be adapted to most scenarios to achieve the optimal

combination gain.

Depending on which feature is enabled first, the following counters and performance

indicators might decrease after the other feature is enabled:

- If the Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility feature is enabled first: EUtranCellFDD.pmNumUlPotentialPktLossInd EUtranCellTDD.pmNumUlPotentialPktLossInd Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility Differentiated Inter-Frequency Handover Success Rate Uplink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility Cell Handover Success Rate
- If the Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility feature is enabled first: EUtranCellFDD.pmNumDlPotentialPktLossInd EUtranCellTDD.pmNumDlPotentialPktLossInd Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility Handover Success Rate Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility Cell Handover Success Rate

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q2.0: Blind Handover Support for Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility

This feature enhancement introduces a blind handover procedure for the

Downlink-Triggered VoLTE Mobility feature.

| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0444                        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                 |
| Access Type            | LTE                                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces downlink-triggered blind handover to ensure

downlink coverage for UEs with a voice bearer. This allows the Downlink-Triggered

VoLTE Mobility feature to perform intra-LTE inter-frequency blind handover to move

the UE to another cell if fast degradation of downlink radio conditions is

detected.

This feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Packet loss is reduced.
- VoLTE quality is improved.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement might improve VoLTE quality if the following conditions are

met:

- A large VoLTE packet loss occurs because of PDSCH DTX.
- The VoLTE load is high or medium in the eNodeB.
- A blind handover can be performed.

This feature enhancement improves network performance by performing a blind handover

if the fast degradation of the downlink radio conditions is detected. Blind handover

has a negative impact on handover success rate if the neighbor cell cannot cover the

source cell.

The following KPIs are expected to decrease if the feature is configured for blind

handover:

- Mobility Success Rate
- Cell Handover Success Rate
- Cell Mobility Success Rate

The E-RAB Retainability-Percentage Lost per QCI KPI is expected to increase on the

network level.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the BLINDHO value to the

EUtranCellFDD.dlVolteCovMobDetect and the

EUtranCellTDD.dlVolteCovMobDetect attributes to include the

blind handover option.

During blind handover, the coverage of the target cell is assumed without any

measurements on the target cell.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
