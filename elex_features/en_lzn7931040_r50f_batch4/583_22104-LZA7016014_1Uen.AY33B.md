Summary

This feature introduces a procedure to perform inter-frequency handover when the UE

is in connected mode if the following conditions apply:

- A frequency with higher priority is available.
- Coverage is good.

The operator can turn on the feature in specific cells and specify higher priority

frequencies as inter-frequency handover targets for the UE.

The procedure is performed after one of the following events:

- The UE is connected to the cell where the feature is activated.
- The UE is handed over to the cell where the feature is activated.
- The UE enters a cell with good coverage where the feature is activated, and an A1 measurement report is received.
- The UE has an EN-DC connection and the SCG radio resources are released in the cell where the feature is activated.
- The UE performs RRC connection reestablishment to the cell where the feature is activated.

This feature has the following benefits:

- The UE can be handed over to a cell with better coverage, even if the coverage is good in the original cell.
- Uplink throughput is improved.
- Network capacity is improved.

The feature is recommended to be activated only in cells with low frequency

coverage.

Limitations

The feature might have a negative impact on the features and functions included in

the Energy Efficiency document.

The following UEs are not targeted by the LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher

Priority feature:

- UEs using QCI1 bearers
- UEs with active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk sessions
- UEs with Category M type

If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default value of -1, the Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) value of an emergency call must be higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute. Otherwise, the ARP value must be equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute.

Network Requirements

No impact.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

If the feature is triggered and a delay timer expires, the feature waits for A5

measurement reports until a set timer expires. If the handover measurement evaluation is

successful, the handover is performed.

Operational Process

The feature starts operating when a UE in RRC\_CONNECTED state enters a cell where the

LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority feature is enabled. When the

UeMeasControl.waitStartInterFHoHigherPrio delay timer

expires, the feature requests A5 measurements for the UE and waits for the

measurement report. The UE is handed over to the target frequency at the reception

of the A5 measurement report.

For UEs with EN-DC connection, handover is only allowed if the following conditions

are fulfilled:

- The cell is EN-DC-capable and supports the band combination with the serving NR frequency.Note: To perform a handover without PSCell change, the band combination between the target EUTRAN cell and the PSCell must be supported by the UE. If the target cell is internal, the eNodeB checks if a GUtranCellRelation MO exists between the target cell and the PSCell. For the handover procedure to continue, the GUtranCellRelation.isEndcAllowed attribute must be set to true.
- The EUtranFreqRelation.endcHoFreqPriority attribute is set to a value different than -1.
- The following attributes are set to true: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc

Figure 1   LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority Operational Sequence

1. The procedure is performed after the following events: The UE is connected to the cell where the feature is activated. The UE is handed over to the cell where the feature is activated. The UE enters a cell with good coverage where the feature is activated, and the A1 measurement report is received. The UE has an EN-DC connection and the SCG radio resources are released in the cell where the feature is activated. This event triggers the handover procedure if the following attributes are set to true: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioSnRel EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioSnRel Note: The release of the SCG radio resources triggers handover only if the UE is in a cell with good coverage. The UE performs RRC connection reestablishment to the cell where the feature is activated. This event triggers the handover procedure if the following attributes are set to true: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioRre EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioRre
2. The UeMeasControl.waitStartInterFHoHigherPrio timer is started.
3. After the timer expires, the EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas attribute is checked. If one of the attributes is set to true, feature-specific A1 measurements are configured in the UE. If an A2 measurement report is received before the A1 measurement report is received, the A1 measurement is deconfigured, and the procedure is stopped.
4. The following entering conditions are checked for the UE: The UE is using QCI1 bearers. The UE has an active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk connection. The UE is Category M type. The UE is involved in an emergency call. The UE has an EN-DC connection and the following attributes are set to false: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc For UEs that fulfill any of these conditions, the procedure stops without any further action. Note: If feature-specific A1 measurement is enabled, this step only occurs when an A1 measurement report is received.
5. A5 measurements are configured and the UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer is started. Target frequencies for A5 measurement are defined by the operator by setting the EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute on the frequency level. If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is activated, the operator can use SPID-defined priorities globally or on the cell-level. In this case, the target frequencies for A5 measurement are defined by configuring the following attributes: FreqPrioEUtra.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed EUtraFreqRelProfile.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed The UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer defines the waiting time for the A5 measurement report. If the UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer expires without A5 measurement, the A5 measurement is deconfigured. If an A2 measurement report is received while waiting for the measurement result, the A5 measurement is deconfigured, and the procedure is stopped.
6. If the EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas attribute is set to true, a feature-specific A2 measurement is configured when the UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer expires. If the SCG radio resources are released during A2 measurement configuration, the value of the EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas attribute is not checked. This is because it is already known that the UE is in the feature-specific A1 coverage. The A2 measurement is deconfigured and the handover procedure continues. If a feature-specific A2 measurement report is received, an A1 measurement is configured. This allows A5 measurements to be configured if a feature-specific A1 measurement report is received.
7. If the A5 measurement report is received while the measurement timer is running, the following entering conditions are checked again for the UE: The UE is using QCI1 bearers. The UE has an active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk connection. The UE is Category M type. The UE is involved in an emergency call. The UE has an EN-DC connection and the following conditions are fulfilled: The following attributes are set to false: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc The value of the EUtranFreqRelation.endcHoFreqPriority attribute is set to -1. The reported cell is not EN-DC-capable. The reported cell does not support the band combination with the serving NR frequency. For UEs that fulfill any of these conditions, the procedure stops without further action.
8. Handover is initiated. If the handover measurement evaluation is successful, handover handling continues. If the handover preparation or the handover execution is not successful, the feature waits for the next trigger to start measurement handling.

A5 Measurement Configuration and Handling for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

EN-DC Handover Evaluation for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

## 3.1 Frequency Selection for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

Target frequencies for A5 measurement are defined by the operator, and frequencies

can be prioritized using SPID-defined priorities.

Target frequencies for A5 measurements are defined by the operator by setting the

EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute on

frequency level. If this attribute is set to true, it means that there

is an A5 measurement configured on this frequency. The LTE frequency list contains the

LTE frequencies for which the

EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute is set

to true. The LTE frequency list is ordered according to the

EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute.

The frequency selection process for UEs with an associated SPID value depends on the

configuration of the value of the EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary102 or

the EUtranCellTDD.zzzTemporary102 attributes. The following

configurations are possible:

- If the attribute is set to 0, the operator can use SPID-defined priorities globally or on a cell-level, as introduced by the LTE Multi-Layer Subscriber-Based Mobility function. If the operator uses SPID-defined priorities, the A5 measurement can only be configured on the two highest-defined priorities for the SPID. The priorities are defined by the following attributes: The connectedModeMobilityPrio struct of the RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA attribute if the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is enabled The EUtraFreqRelProfile.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute if cell-level frequency differentiation is enabled along with the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature
- If the attribute is set to any value other than 0, the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature supports the control of UE mobility based on SPID. When the RAT and Frequency Priority Modification function is activated and the UE has a SPID value, the UE can be transferred to another LTE frequency depending on the configuration of the following attributes: The FreqPrioEUtra.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute is used to define the target frequencies if the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is activated. In this case, the LTE frequency list is prioritized by the connectedModeMobilityPrio in the FreqPrioEUTRA struct. Note: The FreqPrioEUtra MO class must have an ID equal to the arfcnValueEUtranDl value from the corresponding RATFreqPrio.freqPrioListEUTRA attribute. The EUtraFreqRelProfile.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute is used to define the target frequencies if the Multi-Layer Subscriber-Based Mobility function is enabled. In this case, the LTE frequency list is prioritized by the EUtraFreqRelProfile.connectedModeMobilityPrio attribute.

## 3.2 A5 Measurement Configuration and Handling for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

A5 measurement conditions are defined through the

ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio MO class and its

attributes.

The LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority feature introduces the

ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio MO class and its attributes,

which allow the configuration of A5 measurements.

The A5 measurement is triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled continually for the

time defined by the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.timeToTriggerA5

attribute:

- If RSRP measurements are used, and the value of the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.triggerQuantityA5 attribute is set to 0, the conditions for the A5 measurement are the following: RSRP\_source &lt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold1Rsrp - ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 RSRP\_target &gt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold2Rsrp + ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 - EUtranFreqRelation.qOffsetFreq - EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran
- If RSRQ measurements are used, and the value of the ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.triggerQuantityA5 attribute is set to1, the conditions for the A5 measurement are the following: RSRQ\_source &lt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold1Rsrq / 10 - ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 RSRQ\_target &gt; ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.a5Threshold2Rsrq / 10 + ReportConfigA5InterFreqHigherPrio.hysteresisA5 / 10 - EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran - EUtranFreqRelation.qOffsetFreq

If the UeMeasControl.bothA5RsrpRsrqCheck attribute is set to

true, the measured values of both RSRP and RSRQ are checked when an

A5 measurement report is triggered by RSRP or RSRQ.

The UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer is introduced to

define the waiting period for the A5 measurement report. If the

UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer expires without

A5 measurement, this A5 measurement is deconfigured.

If an A2 measurement report is received while waiting for the measurement result, the A5

measurement is deconfigured, and the procedure is stopped.

If A5 measurements are received within the time frame defined by the

UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer, the following

entering conditions are checked for the UE:

- The UE is using QCI1 bearers.
- The UE has an active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk connection.
- The UE is Category M type.
- The UE is involved in an emergency call.
- The UE has an EN-DC connection and the following attributes are set to false: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc

For UEs that fulfill any of these conditions, the procedure stops without any further

action.

The handover procedure is continued in the order of the arrival of the UEs if one of the

following options is applicable:

- More than one frequency is configured for measurement handling through the EUtranFreqRelation.interFreqHoHigherPrioAllowed attribute.
- More than one SPID configuration is in place in case of SPID-defined priorities.
- More than one A5 measurement report is received.

## 3.3 Feature-Specific A1 and A2 Measurement Configuration and Handling for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

A1 and A2 measurement conditions can be configured through the attributes under the

ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio MO class.

The

configuration of the

EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas and the

EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

attributes

enable feature-specific A1 and A2 measurements for the LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to

Higher Priority feature. A1 and A2 measurements can be configured through the attributes

under

the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio MO class.

An A1 measurement is triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled continuously for

the time period defined by the

ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.timeToTrigger attribute:

- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 0, RSRP is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRP &gt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrp + ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresis
- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 1, RSRQ is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRQ &gt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrq / 10 + ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresisRsrq / 10

If a feature-specific A1 measurement report is received, the handover procedure

continues

and the entering conditions for A5

measurements

are checked.

If the SCG radio resources are released during A2 measurement configuration, the value of

the

EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

attribute

or the EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

attribute is not checked.

This

is because it is already known that the UE is in the feature-specific A1 coverage. In

this case, the A2 measurement is deconfigured and the handover procedure continues.

An A2 measurement is triggered if the following conditions are fulfilled continuously for

the

time

period defined by the

ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.timeToTrigger attribute:

- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 0, RSRP is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRP &lt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrp - ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresis
- If the value of the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity attribute is set to 1, RSRQ is used as the trigger quantity, and the value of the trigger quantity fulfills the following equation: RSRQ &lt; ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrq / 10 - ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresisRsrq / 10

If a feature-specific A2 measurement report is received, a feature-specific A1

measurement is

configured.

This allows A5 measurements to be configured if a feature-specific A1 measurement report

is

received.

## 3.4 EN-DC Handover Evaluation for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

Additional checks are in place for the inter-frequency handover of UEs configured

with EN-DC.

The handover evaluation process is started with the following additional checks if the UE

is connected with EN-DC:

- Checking if the reported cell is EN-DC-capable. An internal cell is considered EN-DC-capable if the EUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute is not empty and at least one PLMN ID allows EN-DC for the UE in the LTE cell. An external cell is considered EN-DC-capable if the ExternalEUtranCellFDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute or the ExternalEUtranCellTDD.endcAllowedPlmnList attribute is not empty and at least one PLMN ID allows EN-DC for the UE in the LTE cell.
- Checking if the reported cell supports the band combination with the serving NR frequency. Note: To perform a handover without PSCell change, the band combination between the target EUTRAN cell and the PSCell must be supported by the UE. If the target cell is internal, the eNodeB checks if a GUtranCellRelation MO exists between the target cell and the PSCell. For the handover procedure to continue, the GUtranCellRelation.isEndcAllowed attribute must be set to true.
- Checking if the EUtranFreqRelation.endcHoFreqPriority attribute is set to a value different than -1.

If the UE fulfills these conditions, the operation of the feature continues with other

UEs not configured with EN-DC as well. If the UE does not fulfill these conditions, the

A5 measurement is ignored, and the feature waits for the next measurement report until

the UeMeasControl.a5measInterFHoHigherPrioT timer expires.

The feature can be disabled for

EN-DC-connected

UEs by setting the following attributes to false:

- EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc
- EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc

If the feature is disabled for EN-DC-connected UEs, the procedure stops without further

action for these UEs when the entering conditions are checked.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

The feature improves network capacity, UE throughput, and mobility between cells and

frequencies.

Capacity and Performance

Network capacity is enhanced by ensuring that the UE is served by the best available

frequency in the network.

UE throughput might improve by enabling the operator to change to an LTE band when NR

capacity is no longer available.

By enabling inter-frequency handovers, the number of handovers increases, both in

general and within the LTE cell. This can result in MP load increase. The MP load

increase correlates to the increased number of frequency measurements.

Enabling

feature-specific

A1 and A2 measurements has the following impact on capacity and performance:

- The utilization of frequencies with higher priority is improved.
- The UE throughput might improve.
- The number of the following procedures is expected to increase: Handover attempts Handover executions Requested A5 measurements
- The time for performing A5 measurements might decrease because the area for A5 measurement activation decreases.
- The energy consumption of the UE might increase because of the increased number of measurements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The following UEs are not targeted by the LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher

Priority feature:

- UEs using QCI1 bearers
- UEs with active Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk sessions
- Category M type UEs
- UEs involved in emergency calls
- EN-DC-connected UEs if the following attributes are set to false: EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioEndc

# 5 Parameters for LTE Inter-Frequency Handover to Higher Priority

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                          |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces feature-specific A1 and A2 measurements. These

measurements allow the start of A5 measurements when the UE is expected to be in the

coverage of a high-priority cell.

This feature enhancement increases the chance for UEs to perform inter-frequency

handovers to cells with higher priority when the coverage and capacity cells do not

fully overlap. This improves the utilization of higher-prioritized frequencies.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement has the following impact on capacity and performance:

- The utilization of frequencies with higher priority is improved.
- The UE throughput might improve.
- The number of the following procedures is expected to increase: Handover attempts Handover executions Requested A5 measurements
- The time for performing A5 measurements might decrease because the window for A5 measurement activation decreases.
- The energy consumption of the UE might increase because of the increased number of measurements.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes to enable

feature-dedicated A1 and A2 measurements:

- EUtranCellFDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas
- EUtranCellTDD.interFreqHoHigherPrioMeas

This feature enhancement introduces the ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio

MO class for configuring the feature-dedicated A1 and A2 measurements. The following

attributes are used for measurement configuration:

- ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresis
- ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.hysteresisRsrq
- ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrp
- ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.thresholdRsrq
- ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.timeToTrigger
- ReportConfigA1A2HigherPrio.triggerQuantity

The default values of the introduced attributes are the optimal values. Additional

tuning might be required depending on the site and

the

configuration.

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters to monitor the number

of configured feature-specific A1 and A2 measurements and the resulting measurement

reports:
