Summary

The Release Inactive UE at High Load Handover feature allows for improved

accessibility in high-load networks. The feature has a larger gain in

handover-intense areas. The feature contributes to reducing inter-cell interference

as fewer UEs are connected at the cell border.

# 3 Feature Operation of Release Inactive UE at High Load Handover

This feature handles the release of inactive UEs during handover.

Figure 1   Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

When a measurement report for intra-E-UTRAN or inter-E-UTRAN handover is received, the

feature checks if the following conditions are met:

- The UE is not an emergency UE.Note: For the classification process of emergency calls, see Emergency Call Prioritization. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331.
- The UE does not have any of the following bearers: QCI 1 QCI 65 QCI 66 QCI 69

If the conditions are met, the following steps are executed:

1. The MP load level is compared to the value of the releaseInactiveUesMpLoadLevel attribute.
2. All bearers for the UE are checked to be inactive.
3. The value of the ENodeBFunction.releaseInactiveUesInactTime attribute is checked to determine if handover or release is going to be executed.

If all the above are true, the feature decides to release the UE with redirect information.

The Released due to inactivity cause is sent to MME. The redirect

information, sent by the eNodeB to the UE in the RRC Connection Release must

contain the same target frequency as the handover was intended for.

# 4 Network Impact of Release Inactive UE at High Load Handover

# 8 Deactivate Release Inactive UE at High Load Handover

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011939 MO instance.
