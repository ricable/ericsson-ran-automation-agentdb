# 3 Feature Operation of PHICH Group Spreading

This feature aims to allocate PHICH group to each UE depending on the number of

available of PHICH groups.

If, for example, there are 7 PHICH groups available and 6 UEs to be distributed, the

feature will try to allocate PHICH group index 0 to first user, PHICH group index 1 to

second user and so on.

If same PHICH group has been assigned to multiple UEs, this feature attempts to assign

maximum PHICH PSD to all UEs within that group.

Operational Process

- Spread PHICH Group: For each UE, the eNB assigns a PHICH group from the range of available PHICH groups which has not previously been assigned. Based on the chosen PHICH group and PRBstart, cyclic shift of DeModulation Reference Signal (n DMRS) is calculated. This is a valid PHICH group assignment if n DMRS &lt; 8, where 8 is the total number of available DMRS cyclic shifts as specified in 3GPP 36.213, Section 9.1.2. For SPS transmissions (activation, retransmission and deactivation) and Message 3, n DMRS is always zero. PHICH group is calculated according to 3GPP 36.213 Section 9.1.2 for such UEs and cannot be pre-assigned. Non-adaptive retransmissions use the same assignments in the next attempt, so their PHICH groups are reused.
- Equalize PHICH Power: After spreading if there are multiple UEs in same PHICH group, then this feature selects the PHICH PSD of UE with maximum value within that group and attempts to assign that PHICH PSD to all the members of that group. The maximum PHICH PSD corresponds to the UE in worst radio conditions. This ensures same transmission power for all UEs in the same group.

# 4 Network Impact of PHICH Group Spreading

This feature improves the performance by increasing uplink speed and making utilization

of the spectrum efficient.

Capacity and Performance

Increasing UE capability to correctly decode PHICH prevents unnecessary transmission

of uplink grants and HARQ retransmissions. This increases uplink speed and makes

efficient utilization of spectrum.

Delay sensitive traffic, for example VoLTE, is not configured with RLC AM, hence it

becomes important that a HARQ transmission is successful. If PHICH is not correctly

decoded in the UE all HARQ re-transmissions for a packet can be lost and the

consequence is complete packet loss for that transmission.

PHICH transmission power is not optimal if there are multiple UEs in same PHICH group

since the PHICH PSD of UE with maximum value is assigned to all the members of that

group. PHICH power control is not operative for UEs in the same group.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

| Uplink Throughput, Uplink Throughput for each QCI | PHICH Group Spreading can provide end user uplink throughput                                     improvement by increasing the probability of correctly decoding                                     PHICH. It increases the uplink PDCP throughput in the networks                                     since; a PDCP packet is less likely to be lost because of error                                     in retransmission feedback. |
