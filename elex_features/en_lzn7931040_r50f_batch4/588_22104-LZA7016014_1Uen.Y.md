Summary

This feature enables decoupling the PDCCH outer loop link adaptation scheme into

uplink and downlink

processes.

With decoupling, PDCCH outer loop adjustment is improved if DTX is caused by PUSCH or

PUCCH. Decoupling the uplink and downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation helps to

avoid unnecessary reduction of PDCCH uplink or downlink SINR.

The feature can also replace uplink PDCCH

outer

loop link adaptation with downlink PDCCH

outer

loop link adaptation if the DTX difference exceeds the threshold

set by the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres or the

EUtranCellTDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres attribute.

If the PDCCH downlink DTX rate is higher than the PDCCH uplink DTX rate, downlink DTX

can be limited for decreasing downlink PDCCH SINR.

This feature has the following benefits:

- PDCCH outer loop link adaptation is improved.
- Interference of the uplink and downlink PDCCH is avoided.
- The CCE aggregation level is optimized.
- PDCCH congestion might be prevented.

# 3 Feature Operation LTE Decoupled Downlink and Uplink PDCCH Link Adaptation

This feature splits the PDCCH link adaptation scheme into uplink and downlink.

PDCCH outer loop link adaptation based on combined uplink and downlink HARQ measurement

leads to the incorrect adjustment of PDCCH if the difference between uplink and downlink

DTX rate is obvious. By separating uplink and downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation,

PDCCH link adjustment can be more accurate.

To enable decoupling of uplink and downlink PDCCH link adaptation, the

EUtranCellFDD.decoupledPdcchLaEnabled or the

EUtranCellTDD.decoupledPdcchLaEnabled attribute must be set to

true.

The feature uses the following attributes as threshold for the absolute value of uplink

DTX rate minus downlink DTX rate:

- EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres
- EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres

A higher threshold value means that decoupling is less likely to be triggered.

Figure 1    Downlink and Uplink PDCCH Outer Loop Link Adaptation

1. DTX rate is calculated periodically based on the congestion measurement period. If the Optimized PDCCH feature is activated, the length of the measurement period can be defined through the following attributes: EUtranCellFDD.pdcchCongestMeasurePeriod EUtranCellTDD.pdcchCongestMeasurePeriod Otherwise, the length of the measurement period is 1 ms. At the beginning of each measurement period, it is determined if the decoupling conditions are met. Decoupling or non-decoupling can be switched in different measurement periods.
2. If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.decoupledPdcchLaEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.decoupledPdcchLaEnabled attribute is set to true, decoupling is possible. Otherwise, uplink and downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation is combined.
3. If the absolute difference between uplink DTX rate and downlink DTX rate is higher than or equal to the threshold set by the value of the EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres or the EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres attribute, decoupling PDCCH uplink and downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation is triggered. Otherwise, uplink and downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation is combined.
4. When decoupling PDCCH uplink and downlink outer loop link adaptation is triggered, the feature checks if the difference that refers to the downlink DTX rate subtracted from the uplink DTX rate, exceeds a preset threshold. The threshold is defined by configuring the value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres or the EUtranCellTDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres attribute.
5. If the preset threshold is exceeded, the feature leads to the following outcomes: The uplink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation is replaced by the downlink PDCCH outer loop link adaptation. As a result of the replacement, a lower CCE aggregation level is selected for the uplink that helps to avoid PDCCH congestion. PDCCH downlink outer loop adjustment is implemented if downlink HARQ is carried by PUCCH. Therefore, the feature helps avoid the selection of a higher CCE level if the eNodeB does not receive downlink HARQ feedback because of poor PUSCH. If downlink HARQ feedback is carried by PUSCH, downlink outer loop adjustment is not triggered. In this case, the last result of PDCCH downlink outer loop adjustment calculation is maintained.
6. The feature checks if the difference that refers to the uplink DTX rate subtracted from the downlink DTX rate is higher than the sum of the values of the following attributes: EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres and EUtranCellFDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres and EUtranCellTDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset If the downlink DTX rate minus uplink DTX rate is higher than the sum of the attribute values, downlink PDCCH outer loop adjustment triggered by downlink DTX is stopped. The last result of PDCCH downlink outer loop adjustment calculation is maintained.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Decoupled Downlink and Uplink PDCCH Link Adaptation

This feature can help to avoid PDCCH outer loop link adaptation mutual influence

between uplink and downlink and might relieve PDCCH congestion, especially in high load

traffic.

Capacity and Performance

If uplink and downlink payload volume is less restricted by PDCCH exhaustion,

improved uplink and downlink cell throughput is expected in high load conditions. As

the primary benefit of the feature, the average CCE aggregation level might

decrease.

The feature affects the number of

scheduled

entities for a TTI in the following ways:

- The number of scheduled entities for a TTI might increase as a result of reduced restriction by CCE exhaustion.
- The average PDCCH CCE use decreases under the same number of scheduled entities for a TTI.
- If more scheduled entities for a TTI are scheduled, CCE use might increase.

With decoupling, PDCCH uses less CCE resource for uplink scheduling so the UE might

fail to receive uplink scheduling requests.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for LTE Decoupled Downlink and Uplink PDCCH Link Adaptation

Triggering decoupling depends on the values of the threshold-related

attributes.

The operator can obtain the number of samples of DTX rate difference distribution through

the following counters on particular bins:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcchUlDtxWorseDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcchUlDtxWorseDistr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcchDlDtxWorseDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcchDlDtxWorseDistr

Each bin represents the range of difference between uplink DTX rate and downlink DTX rate

and the amount of pegging in each bin represents how frequent the given difference took

place during each ROP.

The value of the EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres or the

EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres attribute affects how

frequently decoupling uplink and downlink PDCCH link adaptation is triggered within the

observation period.

The values of the following attributes affects how frequently uplink and downlink PDCCH

outer loop adjustment protection is triggered within the observation period:

- EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres
- EUtranCellFDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset
- EUtranCellFDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres

or

- EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres
- EUtranCellTDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset
- EUtranCellTDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres

The lower these thresholds are set, the more frequently decoupling uplink and downlink

PDCCH link adaptation and PDCCH outer loop adjustment protection are triggered.

Applicable Scenario with Decoupling

The percentage value of the PM counters represents sum of all samples collected on

the considered bin indexes with respect to the maximum possible samples. The higher

proportion of higher bins is, the more obvious the difference and the greater gain

are.

Disabling Conditional Decoupling

Checking the absolute value of DTX rate difference is a condition involved in

decision making whether to trigger decoupling.

Conditional decoupling is disabled through the following settings:

- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres or the EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres attribute is set to zero.
- The sum of the following attributes is greater than or equal to 100: EUtranCellFDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset and EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres EUtranCellTDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset and EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres

Summary and Benefits

The decreased value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres or

the EUtranCellTDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres attribute can trigger more

uplink PDCCH outer loop adjustments replaced by downlink PDCCH outer loop

adjustments when the uplink DTX ratio is worse than the downlink DTX ratio. This

replacement leads to optimized downlink and uplink outer loop adjustment.

The decreased value of the EUtranCellFDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres and

the EUtranCellTDD.pdcchUlDtxWorseThres attributes can also result

in triggering more PDCCH downlink outer loop adjustments if downlink HARQ is carried

by PUCCH. This way, a higher CCE level is not selected if the eNodeB does not

receive downlink HARQ feedback because of poor PUSCH.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement provides further options for decoupling between uplink and

downlink PDCCH link adaptation and outer loop adjustment through checking the

absolute value of DTX rate difference between uplink DTX rate and downlink DTX

rate.

At the beginning of each PDDCH measurement period, the feature enhancement compares

the absolute value of DTX rate difference to a threshold. If the absolute value of

DTX rate difference is greater than or equal to the threshold, decoupling PDCCH

uplink and downlink PDCCH link adaptation and outer loop adjustment is triggered.

The threshold is set by the value of the

EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres or the

EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres attribute.

If the PDCCH downlink DTX rate is higher than the PDCCH uplink DTX rate, downlink DTX

can be limited for decreasing downlink PDCCH SINR.

Compared to unconditional decoupling, conditional decoupling helps to

prevent

the impact of increased average CCE aggregation level. This

prevention is

especially

important if the difference between the uplink DTX rate and the downlink DTX rate is

small at feature

activation.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement might

affect

the following KPIs:

- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput
- Average DL PDCP Cell Throughput
- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput
- Average UL PDCP Cell Throughput

This feature enhancement might

affect

the following Performance Indicators:

- Average CCE Aggregation Level
- Average PDCCH CCE Utilization
- Scheduling Entities per TTI DL
- Scheduling Entities per TTI UL

Also, this feature enhancement might increase the PDCCH Packet Error Rate Performance

Indicator.

- EUtranCellTDD.pmPucchFailSr
- EUtranCellFDD.pmUlSinrPdcchDistr
- EUtranCellTDD.pmUlSinrPdcchDistr

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres
- EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres

A higher threshold value means that decoupling is less likely to be triggered.

Also, this feature enhancement introduces the following attributes as offsets for

stopping downlink PDCCH outer loop adjustment triggered by downlink DTX:

- EUtranCellFDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset
- EUtranCellTDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset

The lower the offset value is,

the

easier it is to stop downlink PDCCH

outer loop adjustment triggered by downlink DTX.

PDCCH downlink outer loop adjustment is maintained when downlink DTX is received if

the value of downlink DTX rate minus uplink DTX rate is greater than the sum of the

following values:

- EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres and EUtranCellFDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset or
- EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres and EUtranCellTDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset

This feature enhancement can be

disabled

through the following settings:

- The value of the EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres or the EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres attribute is set to zero.
- The sum of the following attributes is greater than or equal to 100: EUtranCellFDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset and EUtranCellFDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres EUtranCellTDD.pdcchDlOlaDtxOffset and EUtranCellTDD.decouplePdcchDtxThres

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.
