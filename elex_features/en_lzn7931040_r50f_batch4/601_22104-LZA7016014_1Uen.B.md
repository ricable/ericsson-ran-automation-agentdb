Summary

The feature delays handover, RwR, and EN-DC procedures when an attempt for VoLTE call

setup is detected through IMS or RRC signaling to allow for the establishment of a

QCI1 bearer. This prevents the interruption of VoLTE call setup by RAN mobility or

traffic steering procedures.

The feature has the following benefits:

- The average time for VoLTE call setup decreases.
- The success rate of QCI1 bearer establishment increases.
- The user experience improves.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup

The feature prioritizes the establishment of a QCI1 bearer for a VoLTE call by

delaying handover, RwR, and EN-DC procedures when an attempt for VoLTE call setup is

detected through IMS or RRC signaling.

The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature prioritizes QCI1 bearer

establishment for VoLTE calls over RAN procedures in connected mode, such as handover,

RwR, and EN-DC procedures.

The prioritization of the QCI1 bearer establishment is achieved through delaying mobility

actions in the following way:

- B1 and B2 measurement reports that trigger mobility actions towards GSM, WCDMA, and NR are discarded.
- A3 and A5 measurement reports that trigger intra-LTE inter-frequency or intra-frequency mobility actions are discarded.
- Blind IRAT mobility actions to GSM, WCDMA, or NR, and blind intra-LTE mobility actions that are triggered by the reception of A2 measurement reports are blocked.
- In EN-DC configurations, B1 measurement reports that trigger the EN-DC Secondary Node Addition and the Secondary Cell Group Addition procedures are discarded.

The feature delays mobility actions until a QCI1 bearer is established for the VoLTE

call, or until the mobility delay is stopped by any of the stopper mechanisms.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Mobility Delay Sequence Diagram

1. The feature detects an attempt at VoLTE call setup in any of the following cases: The value of the RobustCallSetup.imsSignalingDetectionEnabled attribute is set to true and any IMS signaling is detected on the QCI5 bearer. The value of the RobustCallSetup.moVoiceDetectionEnabled attribute is set to true and an RRC RRCConnectionRequest message is received from the UE with the establishmentCause IE defined as mo-VoiceCall-v1280 or emergency.
    1. The feature delays handover, RwR, and EN-DC setup procedures to prioritize the establishment of the QCI1 bearer for the VoLTE call. The following attributes are used to configure which mobility procedures are delayed: RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled The feature starts the guard timer configured through the RobustCallSetup.guardTimer attribute when the feature starts the mobility delay.
    2. The feature does not initiate the mobility delay in the following cases: A mobility or EN-DC setup procedure is already in progress. Note: A procedure is considered to be in progress if the measurement report that triggers the procedure is received before the feature starts the mobility delay. CSFB is in progress. The RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to true and the UE is in the outer search or critical zone of the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature.
3. The feature stops the mobility delay if any of the following stopping mechanisms are fulfilled: The QCI1 bearer is established for the VoLTE call. The QCI1 bearer establishment failure is indicated in the S1AP E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message. The RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to true and an A2 Critical measurement report of the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is received. The RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is set to true and an A2 UL Critical Coverage measurement report of the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature is received. A CSFB request is received. The Service or Priority-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover feature is activated and an A5 measurement is configured in the UE. The guard timer configured through the RobustCallSetup.guardTimer attribute expires.

## 3.1 Detection of QCI1 Bearer Establishment

The feature is enabled by configuring any of the detection methods of VoLTE call

setup attempts.

The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature starts delaying mobility actions

in connected mode when the feature detects an attempt for a VoLTE call setup. The

following detection methods can be enabled:

- Detection through IMS signaling on the QCI5 bearer
- Detection through RRC signaling

Detection Through IMS Signaling

To enable the detection of IMS signaling on the QCI5 bearer, the value of the

RobustCallSetup.imsSignalingDetectionEnabled attribute must

be set to true. In this case, the feature initiates the mobility

delay procedure when SIP signaling is detected on the QCI5 bearer.

Detection Through RRC Signaling

To enable the detection of mobile-originating voice requests from idle mode, the

value of the RobustCallSetup.moVoiceDetectionEnabled attribute

must be set to true. In this case, the feature initiates the

mobility delay procedure when it detects an attempt at mobile-originating VoLTE call

setup when the establishmentCause IE defined as

mo-VoiceCall-v1280 or emergency is received in the

RRCConnectionRequest message.

## 3.2 Operation of Guard Timer

The feature introduces a guard timer to prevent delaying mobility actions

indefinitely.

The feature prevents too long mobility delays that might cause the connection to be lost

or the quality of the connection to be degraded by introducing a guard timer. The guard

timer is configurable through the RobustCallSetup.guardTimer

attribute.

The guard timer works in the following way:

1. The feature starts the guard timer when the feature starts the mobility delay.
2. The guard timer automatically stops when the feature stops the mobility delay.
3. If the guard timer expires before a QCI1 bearer is established, it stops the mobility delay.

Configuration of Guard Timer

The value of the RobustCallSetup.guardTimer attribute must fulfill

the following conditions:

- The guard timer must be long enough to ensure that the QCI1 bearer is established for the VoLTE call.
- The guard timer must not be too long to avoid delaying mobility actions for too long that might lead to adverse effects in mobility and traffic steering procedures.

The guard timer is recommended to be calibrated on the eNodeB level based on the

values of the EUtranCellFDD.pmRobustCallSetupGuardTimeDistr and

the EUtranCellTDD.pmRobustCallSetupGuardTimeDistr PM counters,

which show the time of VoLTE call setup in the cells.

The guard timer is calibrated through the following equation:

guardTimer = pmRobustCallSetupGuardTimeDistrmax + 1

s

## 3.3 Mobility Delay in Poor Coverage

The feature does not delay mobility actions in connected mode if the UE is in the

outer search or in the critical zone of the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage or the

Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility features.

Delaying mobility procedures when the UE is in poor coverage might lead to losing the

connection.

The value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is

recommended to be set to the default value of true to allow for blind

mobility procedures when the UE is in poor coverage.

Mobility Delay in Downlink Poor Coverage

In downlink, if the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature is activated and the

value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled attribute is

set to true, the feature works in the following way:

- The mobility delay is not initiated for detected attempts for VoLTE call setup if the UE is in the outer search zone or in the critical zone.
- Ongoing mobility delay is interrupted when an A2 Critical measurement report is received, allowing the blind mobility procedure to start immediately.

If the value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled

attribute is set to false, the feature delays  blind mobility

procedures triggered by the reception an A2 Critical measurement report.

Mobility Delay in Uplink Poor Coverage

In uplink, the feature considers the uplink search zone defined by the Uplink-Triggered Inter-Frequency Mobility feature during

the mobility delay procedure.

If the value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled

attribute is set to true, the feature interrupts the ongoing

mobility delay when an A2 UL Critical Coverage measurement report is received,

allowing the blind mobility procedure to start immediately.

If the value of the RobustCallSetup.poorCoverageEnhEnabled

attribute is set to false, the feature delays blind mobility

procedures triggered by the reception of A2 UL Critical Coverage measurement

reports.

The feature delays handover, RwR, and EN-DC setup procedures to prioritize the

establishment of the QCI1 bearer for VoLTE calls. Depending on the priorities in the

network, the following attributes can be used to configure which mobility procedures are

delayed by the feature:

- RobustCallSetup.geranUtranMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.nrMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.intraLteMobilityDelayEnabled
- RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled

Parameters for LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup

## 9.3 Mobility Delay in EN-DC Configurations

The Secondary Node Addition and the Secondary Cell Group Addition procedures in

EN-DC configurations are affected by the LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup

feature.

B1 measurement reports during the Secondary Node Addition and the Secondary Cell Group

Addition procedures are discarded if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature is enabled.
- The value of the RobustCallSetup.endcSetupDelayEnabled attribute is set to true.

This delays the completion of the procedures until a QCI1 bearer is established for

the VoLTE call, or until any of the stopper mechanisms are fulfilled. After the mobility

delay stops, the node does not discard B1 measurement reports and continues the

procedures.

To ensure that the B1 measurement report is received within the B1 measurement interval

even after the mobility delay, it is recommended to set the value of the

ReportConfigB1GUtra.reportIntervalB1 attribute to

MS\_480 or higher.

If the value of the ENodeBFunction.endcS1OverlapMode attribute is set

to true, the Improved Handling of S1 Procedures during EN-DC Procedures

function of the Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature is active. In this case, if a

request for QCI1 bearer establishment is received while there is an ongoing EN-DC

procedure on the node, the LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature initiates

the mobility delay and the QCI1 bearer establishment is executed after the EN-DC

procedure.

If the value of the ENodeBFunction.endcS1OverlapMode attribute is set

to false, the Improved Handling of S1 Procedures during EN-DC

Procedures function of the Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature is not active. In this

case, the LTE Delayed Mobility for Robust Call Setup feature does not initiate mobility

delay during ongoing EN-DC procedures.
