Summary

Next

Generation

eCall

is

introduced in 3GPP Release

14.

The feature is designed as an

IP/IMS-based

solution for emergency calls initiated by In-Vehicle System (IVS) UEs, where

incident

related-data

is sent using SIP signaling without interfering with the voice

channel.

The Next Generation eCall Support for Emergency Calls feature enables the deployment

of the end-to-end solution for Next Generation eCall by broadcasting Next Generation

eCall availability to IVS UEs on cell

level.

# 2 Dependencies of NG eCall Support for Emergency Calls

The feature requires support from various network elements, such as the IMS Core and

the Public Safety Answering Point

(PSAP).

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled to ensure that the feature is fully

operational as part of the end-to-end Next Generation eCall solution:

- The UE is compliant with 3GPP Release 14 or later.
- The IMS Core supports the Next Generation eCall.
- The PSAP supports the Next Generation eCall.
- The LTE RAN broadcasts support for Next Generation eCall in the SIB1 message.

# 3 Feature Operation of NG eCall Support for Emergency Calls

The Next Generation eCall enables

capable In-Vehicle System (IVS) UEs to send the Minimum Set of Data

(MSD)

to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

signaling.

The 3GPP Release 14 introduces the Next Generation eCall, which is designed as an

IP/IMS-based solution for emergency calls initiated by IVS UEs. The Next Generation

eCall enables reliable and fast transmission of the MSD using SIP signaling. Therefore

the Next Generation eCall does not interfere with the voice channel.

Operational Process

The operator can configure each cell in eNodeB to broadcast Next Generation eCall

support in the SIB1 message.

When the feature is activated, the eNodeB includes the

eCallOverIMS-Support-r14 IE in the SIB1. This allows capable UEs

that use LTE connectivity to establish IMS-based emergency call using VoLTE, sending

emergency issue-related data (MSD) to the PSAP using SIP signaling.

Calls

Prerequisites

End-to-end support including core network and PSAP is required for the Next

Generation eCall to be available for IVS UEs.

Steps

1. The operator decides in which cell the IE is broadcast, using the EUtranCellFDD.eCallOverImsSupport or EUtranCellTDD.eCallOverImsSupport MO parameter.
2. Based on the value of the EUtranCellFDD.eCallOverImsSupport or EUtranCellTDD.eCallOverImsSupport parameter, the eNodeB broadcasts the availability of eCall over the IMS in the cell through the SI broadcast. An optional IE is included in the SIB1 of the FDD or TDD cell.
3. The IVS UE installed in the car detects if the Next Generation eCall is available in the PLMN network by reading the cell SI.
    1. If the eCallOverIMS-Support IE is present in the SIB1, then the Next Generation eCall is initiated in case of an accident.
    2. If the IE is not present, the IVS initiates First-Generation eCall (TS12 - CS CN Emergency Call) by sending the MSD in-band through the voice channel.

# 4 Network Impact of NG eCall Support for Emergency Calls

The

eCallOverIMS-Support-r14 IE is included in the SIB1 message when the

feature is active in the cell.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

When the feature is active in the cell, the eCallOverIMS-Support-r14

IE is included in the SIB1 message.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.3 or later is required.

# 5 Parameters for NG eCall Support for Emergency Calls

The feature introduces parameters that specify whether the eCall over IMS support is

broadcast to the UEs in the FDD or TDD

cells.
