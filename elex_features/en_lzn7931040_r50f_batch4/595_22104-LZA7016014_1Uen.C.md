Summary

Selected high-priority users can be handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature based

on a threshold configured for the subscription ratio in the cell. If the

subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the configured

threshold, the selected high-priority users are handled by the Subscriber Triggered

Mobility feature. If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the

configured threshold, the selected high-priority users can be handled by the

following features, if the features are activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users

Selected high-priority UEs are handled by the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature

if the subscription ratio is equal to or higher than the configured threshold.

The Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature must be activated and configured for the

feature to function.

If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is equal to or higher than the threshold

defined by the operator, the selected high-priority UEs are handled by the Subscriber

Triggered Mobility feature. This is true even if the

RATFreqPrio.ueCapPrioAllowed or the

UeProfileFilter.ueCapPrioAllowed attribute is set to

true.

If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature cannot configure a frequency, the feature

sends an empty IMMCI IE in the RRC Connection Release

message.

If the subscription ratio in the serving cell is below the configured threshold, the

selected high-priority UEs

are

excluded from being handled by the

Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature. In this case,

the

excluded high-priority UEs are handled by the

following

features

if the features are activated and configured:

- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- Evolved Load-Based Distribution at Release
- Load-Based Distribution at Release

High-priority

UEs

must be selected by configuring one of the following attributes:

- UeProfileFilter.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl
- RATFreqPrio.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl

The subscription ratio threshold can be configured through one of the following

attributes:

- EUtranCellFDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr
- EUtranCellTDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012748 MO instance.
2. Select the SPIDs assigned to the selected high-priority UEs through one of the following attributes: UeProfileFilter.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl RATFreqPrio.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtIncl
3. Configure the subscription ratio-based threshold to a value higher than 0 in each cell where this feature must take effect. The subscription ratio in the serving cell is configured through the following attributes: EUtranCellFDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr EUtranCellTDD.spidUeEnhLoadMgmtThr

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate LTE Enhanced Inter-Frequency Load Management for High-Priority Users

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012748 MO instance.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
