## Mentoring and Knowledge Transfer

### 1. Implementation Guidance

#### ✅ SDK Usage Patterns
```typescript
// Recommended pattern for SDK initialization
const sdk = new RANOptimizationSDK({
  ...PRODUCTION_RAN_CONFIG,
  environment: 'production'
});

await sdk.initialize(); // Required before any operations

// Recommended pattern for optimization execution
const result = await sdk.optimizeRANPerformance(metrics);
// Always check result.success before using optimizations
```

#### ✅ Performance Optimization Guidelines
- **Cache Configuration**: Use LRU with 10K entries for optimal performance
- **Parallel Execution**: Limit to 20 concurrent agents to avoid resource contention
- **Memory Management**: Enable compression and configure appropriate cache sizes
- **Monitoring**: Implement real-time metrics collection and alerting

#### ✅ Error Handling Best Practices
```typescript
// Recommended error handling pattern
try {
  const result = await sdk.optimizeRANPerformance(metrics);
  if (result.success) {
    // Process successful optimization
    await applyOptimizations(result.optimizations);
  } else {
    // Handle optimization failure
    logger.error('Optimization failed', { error: result.error });
    await fallbackOptimization(metrics);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle unexpected errors
  logger.error('Unexpected error', { error: error.message });
  await emergencyRecovery();
}
```
