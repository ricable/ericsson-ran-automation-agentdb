// Initialize agents
const ingestionAgent = new RANIngestionAgent({
  sources: [/* your data sources */],
  temporalReasoningEnabled: true,
  realTimeProcessing: true
});

// Create cognitive pipeline
const streamChain = new StreamChain();
streamChain.registerAgent(ingestionAgent);

const pipelineId = streamChain.createPipeline({
  name: 'RAN Cognitive Pipeline',
  agents: [ingestionAgent],
  topology: 'cognitive'
});

// Process RAN metrics
const results = await streamChain.processMessage(pipelineId, message, {
  enableTemporalReasoning: true,
  enableCognitiveOptimization: true
