# Stream-Chain Skill

Execute sophisticated multi-step workflows where each agent's output flows into the next, enabling complex data transformations and sequential processing pipelines.

## Overview

Stream-Chain provides two powerful modes for orchestrating multi-agent workflows:

1. **Custom Chains** (`run`): Execute custom prompt sequences with full control
2. **Predefined Pipelines** (`pipeline`): Use battle-tested workflows for common tasks

Each step in a chain receives the complete output from the previous step, enabling sophisticated multi-agent coordination through streaming data flow.

## Quick Start

### Run a Custom Chain

```bash
claude-flow stream-chain run \
  "Analyze codebase structure" \
  "Identify improvement areas" \
  "Generate action plan"
```

### Execute a Pipeline

```bash
claude-flow stream-chain pipeline analysis
```
